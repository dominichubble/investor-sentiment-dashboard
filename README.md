## 🧭 Project Overview  

The **Investor Sentiment Dashboard** is an interactive analytics system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) to analyse public sentiment surrounding financial assets, including **ETFs**, **cryptocurrencies**, and **stocks**.  

The goal of this project is to explore how social and news media sentiment correlates with market trends and to present those findings transparently through an explainable AI interface.

## 🧠 Objectives  

- Aggregate sentiment data from **Reddit**, **X (Twitter)**, and **financial news APIs**.  
- Apply **FinBERT** for financial-domain sentiment classification (positive / negative / neutral).  
- Integrate **Explainable AI** tools such as **SHAP** and **LIME** to interpret model predictions.  
- Build an interactive, web-based dashboard using **React** (frontend) and **FastAPI** (backend).  
- Evaluate accuracy, interpretability, and usability of the system.
