      "selftext": "I know a lot of people see NVDA as a “never sell” kind of stock, especially with how strong it’s been the past few years. It’s obviously been a big winner for many, and it feels like it still has room to run with AI and data center demand. But I’m curious, at what point do you actually take some profit or rotate into something else? Maybe when the growth slows? Or valuation stretches too far? Or if competition heats up in the AI space and margins start to compress? I’m not planning to sell right now, and I’m definitely bullish long term. But I’m also trying to be a little more thoughtful about my positions and not just say “I’ll hold forever” without having some kind of plan. Do you have a specific metric or condition that would make you reduce your position? Or are you just holding for the long haul and planning to reassess down the road?",

If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you’d be rich now \\- if you can’t afford an $15 salad then this isn’t for you. Go buy your $12 value meal \\- no one has ever complained about “sweetgreen shits” like they do with chipotle. Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality.

If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you ’ d be rich now if you can ’ t afford an $ 15 salad then this isn ’ t for you . Go buy your $ 12 value meal no_one has ever complained about “ sweetgreen shits ” like they do with chipotle . Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality . High rollers can absolutely tell DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH NOT_FINANCIAL ADVICE ."

      "selftext": "Hear me out because I think many people do not consider this. 1. Many people will withdraw their investments when they *have to*, not when the market is particularly suitable for withdrawal. 2. This means that the market's average annual returns over the past 50 years don't mean that much if it just so happens that you have to withdraw during a market downturn. 3. This means the \"average return\" you are likely interested in is not \"average return till now\" - it's the average of \"return till X period, return till 2X period, return till 3X period, ... return till now\". This is a relatively different number from the \"average return till now\" number - depending on how you pick the \"X period\". This \"X period\" dictates your actual risk appetite IMO. For someone who feels they might have to withdraw on a day's notice (X = 1 day), the actual average return is a lot lower. Even with 1 month's notice it comes to around 7% per my calculations, not the standard 12% annual returns people assume. Now I understand there is also a large number of people investing for whom this is not strictly relevant because they have a decent emergency corpus. But nowadays many people are investing without that cover in place. The closest industry term I can find is \"AHPR\" (average holding period return) but it's not quite the same it seems? And also not that widely discussed. IMO it's unfair to the normal middle class investors that this is not clearly communicated to them. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I’m looking to start building a Section 8 portfolio and wanted to get some feedback from those of you who’ve already gone down this path. Full disclosure: I’m not here for the “don’t do it” horror stories, I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants, just like any other type of tenant, and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening. A little about my situation: I’m based in Florida, but I’m considering investing out of state. Florida’s a tough market for single-family homes, especially with high insurance costs and the ever-present risk of hurricanes. I’m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere, but I need some advice on where exactly to focus. A few specific questions: * Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio? * How did you determine the market you’re investing in is solid for Section 8? * I’ve heard mixed things about Detroit, the houses are dirt cheap, but what’s the catch? Is it really a bad spot for Section 8? * Is a 5% ROI (after property management, mortgage, etc.) considered too low? I know ROI can vary, but what do you typically look for as a “sweet spot” for a sustainable portfolio? * Do you focus on 2-bed, 3-bed, or 4-bed units? Why? I’d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it. Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow, suggestions would be helpful, especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

Full disclosure I ’ m not_here for the “ don ’ t do it ” horror stories I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants just like any other type of tenant and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening . A little about my situation I ’ m based in Florida but I ’ m considering investing out of state . Florida ’ s a tough market for singlefamily homes especially with high insurance costs and the everpresent risk of hurricanes . I ’ m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere but I need some advice on where exactly to focus . A few specific questions Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio How did you determine the market you ’ re investing in is solid for Section 8 I ’ ve heard mixed things about Detroit the houses are dirt cheap but what ’ s the catch Is it really a bad spot for Section 8 Is a 5 % ROI after property management mortgage etc . considered too low I know ROI can vary but what do you typically look for as a “ sweet spot ” for a sustainable portfolio Do you focus on 2bed 3bed or 4bed units Why I ’ d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it . Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow suggestions would be helpful especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "The current S&P 500 bull market turned three years old in October 2025. Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist of financial services firm Carson Group, points out that once a bull market hits three years, it has a much better chance of stretching to an average of eight years, based on analysis of data going back to 1950. Detrick's confidence in this market stems from the healthy earnings growth that tech companies have been clocking. Additionally, HSBC analysts expect the S&P 500 index to hit 7,500 levels, driven by the sustained spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Technology stocks in particular have clocked impressive returns in 2025, as is evident from the 22% gains registered by the tech-heavy **Nasdaq Composite** index. The good news for tech investors is that the Nasdaq is likely to head higher in 2026 as well, driven by a broader market rally. With gains of 81% so far in 2025, **Advanced Micro Devices** (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has outperformed the broader **PHLX Semiconductor Sector** index's 46% gains by a wide margin. This solid performance is a result of AMD's growing stature in the artificial intelligence data center market, where its graphics processing units (GPUs) and server processors are experiencing healthy demand. **Alphabet** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another Nasdaq stock that has done pretty well on the market in 2025, registering 67% gains as of this writing. The \"Magnificent Seven\" stock's healthy gains aren't surprising, as Alphabet has been growing at a healthy pace thanks to its AI investments. Whats your take on these two... are there better buys right now?",

      "selftext_processed": "The current SP 500 bull market turned three years old in October 2025 . Ryan Detrick the chief market strategist of financial services firm Carson Group points out that once a bull market hits three years it has a much better chance of stretching to an average of eight years based on analysis of data going back to 1950 . Detricks confidence in this market stems from the healthy earnings growth that tech companies have been clocking . Additionally HSBC analysts expect the SP 500 index to hit 7500 levels driven by the sustained spending on artificial intelligence AI infrastructure . Technology stocks in particular have clocked impressive returns in 2025 as is evident from the 22 % gains registered by the techheavy Nasdaq Composite index . The good news for tech investors is that the Nasdaq is likely to head higher in 2026 as well driven by a broader market rally . With gains of 81 % so far in 2025 Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQ AMD stock has outperformed the broader PHLX Semiconductor Sector indexs 46 % gains by a wide margin . This solid performance is a result of AMDs growing stature in the artificial intelligence data center market where its graphics processing units GPUs and server processors are experiencing healthy demand . Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is another Nasdaq stock that has done pretty well on the market in 2025 registering 67 % gains as of this writing . The Magnificent Seven stocks healthy gains arent surprising as Alphabet has been growing at a healthy pace thanks to its AI investments . Whats your take on these two ... are there better buys right now"

      "selftext": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor ($TSEM). They keep looking at it as if it’s just another foundry. The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits, and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations. Here’s what I mean. This week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know: co-packaged optics (CPO) are taking longer to develop than expected, and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer. Copper reaches its limits, then pluggables will lead the next phase, and only later will we move deeper into CPO. That’s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled. Tower doesn’t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers. Instead, they are the \"boring but essential\" layer beneath it. They make the specialty silicon (silicon photonics and analog/power components) that much of the optics ecosystem relies on. And it’s not a small ecosystem. Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers, including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers. These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers, forming a chain that looks like this: $TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $AMZN (AWS), $GOOGL, $MSFT, $META. A clear example is InnoLight, a key player in optics/transceivers, which has partnered with Tower to build high-speed transceivers on Tower’s PH18 silicon photonics platform. InnoLight sells to hyperscalers. That shows the real connection in practice. Now, what makes this more than just \"another AI stock\" is the physics. Tower’s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultra-low-loss silicon nitride waveguides. This kind of \"on-chip optics\" performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics, like photonic gyros. Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work, and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers. Then there’s third-party validation: - Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers. - Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier. This isn’t just marketing; these organizations don’t give out awards lightly. Tower is also not limited to one small fabrication plant. They have significant geographic reach, including a majority stake (51%) in their operation in Japan (TPSCo). This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability. Meanwhile, competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital: - $GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics. - $INTC attempted to buy Tower outright. This indicates that the narrative of \"Tower is special\" isn't just a retail story. So the takeaway is straightforward: If pluggables are the near-term reality, and Broadcom has just reinforced that, then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on. Tower appears less like a \"foundry stock\" and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem, with actual traction, solid customers, and an edge in physics. That’s why the demand appears \"sensational.\" It’s not random; it’s structural. $TSEM $AMZN $GOOGL $MSFT $META $AVGO $INTC $GFS",

      "selftext_processed": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor $ TSEM . They keep looking at it as if it ’ s just another foundry . The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations . Here ’ s what I mean . This week Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know copackaged optics CPO are taking longer to develop than expected and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer . Copper reaches its limits then pluggables will lead the next phase and only later will we move deeper into CPO . That ’ s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled . Tower doesn ’ t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers . Instead they are the boring but essential layer beneath it . They make the specialty silicon silicon photonics and analogpower components that much of the optics ecosystem relies on . And it ’ s not_a small ecosystem . Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers . These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers forming a chain that looks like this $ TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $ AMZN AWS $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META . A clear example is InnoLight a key player in opticstransceivers which has partnered with Tower to build highspeed transceivers on Tower ’ s PH18 silicon photonics platform . InnoLight sells to hyperscalers . That shows the real connection in practice . Now what makes this more than just another AI stock is the physics . Tower ’ s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultralowloss silicon nitride waveguides . This kind of onchip optics performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics like photonic gyros . Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers . Then there ’ s thirdparty validation Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers . Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier . This isn ’ t just marketing these organizations don ’ t give out awards lightly . Tower is also not_limited to one small fabrication plant . They have significant geographic reach including a majority stake 51 % in their operation in Japan TPSCo . This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability . Meanwhile competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital $ GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics . $ INTC attempted to buy Tower outright . This indicates that the narrative of Tower is special isnt just a retail story . So the takeaway is straightforward If pluggables are the nearterm reality and Broadcom has just reinforced that then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on . Tower appears less like a foundry stock and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem with actual traction solid customers and an edge in physics . That ’ s why the demand appears sensational . It ’ s not_random it ’ s structural . $ TSEM $ AMZN $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META $ AVGO $ INTC $ GFS"

I’m investing 150 euros per month, split between: * 60 euros into VWCE (FTSE All-World ETF) * 90 euros into CSPX (S&P 500 ETF) This means about 40% in VWCE and 60% in CSPX. From what I understand: * VWCE gives me global exposure, including US, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. * CSPX is 100% US, focused on large-cap growth companies. Based on this allocation, roughly: * \\~84% of my portfolio is US stocks * \\~16% is the rest of the world * \\~28% of the portfolio is technology * Top 10 companies represent about 22–24% My goal is a long-term plan (\\~20 years), aiming for solid returns while maintaining decent diversification.

      "selftext": "Wall Street sentiment is starting to shift more positively heading into 2026, especially after the S&P 500 and Dow both hit record highs in the same week the Federal Reserve delivered a rate cut. The timing mattered markets were already on solid footing, and the policy move helped reinforce the idea that financial conditions may stay supportive for longer. What really stood out to investors were Jerome Powell’s comments after the Fed meeting. Instead of pushing back hard against easing expectations, Powell sounded noticeably less hawkish than many feared. That tone gave markets room to breathe, especially after months of uncertainty around inflation, growth, and the labor market. It doesn’t mean risks are gone valuations are still stretched in parts of the market, and economic data remains mixed but the combination of rate relief and calmer Fed messaging has clearly improved confidence. Right now, it feels like investors are less focused on short-term scares and more willing to look ahead into 2026 with a bit more optimism. Curious how others see it: is this the start of a steadier phase for markets, or just another relief rally before the next macro test? Source: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Wall Street sentiment is starting to shift more positively heading into 2026 especially after the SP 500 and Dow both hit record highs in the same week the Federal Reserve delivered a rate cut . The timing mattered markets were already on solid footing and the policy move helped reinforce the idea that financial conditions may stay supportive for longer . What really stood out to investors were Jerome Powell ’ s comments after the Fed meeting . Instead of pushing back hard against easing expectations Powell sounded noticeably less hawkish than many feared . That tone gave markets room to breathe especially after months of uncertainty around inflation growth and the labor market . It doesn ’ t mean risks are gone valuations are still stretched in parts of the market and economic data remains mixed but the combination of rate relief and calmer Fed messaging has clearly improved confidence . Right now it feels like investors are less focused on shortterm scares and more willing to look ahead into 2026 with a bit more optimism . Curious how others see it is this the start of a steadier phase for markets or just another relief rally before the next macro test Source"

      "selftext": "I’ve always been of the mindset that having some physical gold is important. I know there are many that might disagree, that’s okay, I have my own reasons. But I’ve recently been considering just going all in on gold. Currently, I have a decent emergency fund and a little extra. Then most of my money is in an all world fund (S&S ISA) and a little bit in gold. I don’t have any plans for any big purchases on the horizon. I’m not sure I’ll ever buy a house or start a business. I don’t need access to my funds for the foreseeable future. It seems that gold is pretty solid and will sometimes spike and dip occasionally. Should I just invest purely in gold? I’ll probably just hold onto it and maybe sell some when the market spikes every now and then. I’ll keep a little bit in the all world fund and I’ll buy more of that when it dips (with the money from gold when it spikes). I’ll continue to pay normally into my pension which is in an all world fund also. What do you think?",

      "selftext": "Hello, as a non US and non EU resident, I would love to get an opinion on this dilemma that I have. Right now, I’m holding accumulating Ireland domiciled ETFs as a way to prevent US estate tax and US withholding tax. The tax officials of my country of residence still told me to report its notional distribution using the UK tax reporting documents provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis. What I’m worried about is that by relying on another country for tax treatment, a possible change in how UK treat accumulating ETF will result in me having to sell my investment due to not being able to report the dividends generated anymore. For example: as of now, a tax reporting document will be provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis on their website and can be accessed by everyone but what if this law is removed or the tax reporting information is moved to the UK tax reporting platform? I would have no way to access this at all. What do you think about this? Do you think I should keep my S&P500 + Developed Markets Ex. US ETFs or move completely to Gold or Silver since it doesn’t distribute dividends anyways so regardless of changes, there is nothing for me to report? I’m also down to changing to VT or VTI + VXUS and just realize the gains later when I’m close to retirement but of course, death is always around the corner (I may be overthinking, I’m still 21).",

Right now I ’ m holding accumulating Ireland domiciled ETFs as a way to prevent US estate tax and US withholding tax . The tax officials of my country of residence still told me to report its notional distribution using the UK tax reporting documents provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis . What I ’ m worried about is that by relying on another country for tax treatment a possible change in how UK treat accumulating ETF will result in me having to sell my investment due to not_being able to report the dividends generated anymore . For example as of now a tax reporting document will be provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis on their website and can be accessed by everyone but what if this law is removed or the tax reporting information is moved to the UK tax reporting platform I would have no_way to access this at all . What do you think about this Do you think I should keep my SP500 Developed Markets Ex . US ETFs or move completely to Gold or Silver since it doesn ’ t distribute dividends anyways so regardless of changes there is nothing_for me to report I ’ m also down to changing to VT or VTI VXUS and just realize the gains later when I ’ m close to retirement but of course death is always around the corner I may be overthinking I ’ m still 21 ."

A bunch of outlook reports are out, including Vanguard’s latest (VEMO 2026): Vanguard VEMO 2026 Report: Dummary from report: Global diversification remains key, US large-cap growth is expected to have lower long-term returns, and they favor Fixed Income, US Value, and Non-US Developed Markets over the next 5–10 years. My Take & Plan:- I’m all about diversification and the “VT and Chill” approachit fits nicely with most long-term outlooks and I sleep well at night with it. My investments is and keeps being: Core: VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) – sticking with it as my main holding. Small Tilt: A bit into growth/tech through the nasdaq and BTC, but VT remains the core. I reduced both tilts considerably and increased the VT base. Discussion Points Is Vanguard’s latest outlook/other major inestment firms' outlooks changing how you’re thinking about 2026? Would love to hear your thoughts!",

Main questions: 1. Is this actually sensible? 2. Any % too high / too low? Also not sure if I should include some other individual stocks like Pfizer or Planet Labs which I’ve been following recently. Appreciate any thoughts.",

      "selftext": "I have a 401k and a work Roth, a personal roth and brokerage account. In 2025 i maxed out my personal Roth and contributed about 10k to my brokerage account. I don’t recall exactly how much I added to my 401 k maybe 18k and 5 k to my work roth. Im debating if there is any benefit into contributing to my personal Roth and brokerage account before I’ve maxed out my 401k? The reason I did this during 2025 is because I could select what I purchased with my contributions such as stocks and ETF as opposed to just having my employer/ vanguard manage the funds I add through my direct deposit funds. The only benefit I see is the money being tax free. Are there any other advantages that I am missing? Should I continue this way or max out my 401k for the year first?",

I don ’ t recall exactly how much I added to my 401 k maybe 18k and 5 k to my work roth . Im debating if there is any benefit into contributing to my personal Roth and brokerage account before I ’ ve maxed out my 401k The reason I did this during 2025 is because I could select what I purchased with my contributions such as stocks and ETF as opposed to just having my employer vanguard manage the funds I add through my direct deposit funds . The only benefit I see is the money being tax free . Are there any other advantages that I am missing Should I continue this way or max out my 401k for the year first"

      "selftext": "Not financial advice - just a fascinating valuation case I’ve been digging into. A small-cap called **Acorn Energy (ACFN)** recently had one of the strangest disconnects I’ve seen in a while. # Quick background Acorn makes remote monitoring systems for things like: * backup generators * industrial equipment * energy systems * telecom and data center power setups Basically, once their device is installed, the customer pays **recurring monitoring fees** every year. So the business is part hardware, part subscription. In September, the stock traded a little above **$30**. After Q3 numbers came out, it fell all the way down to **$12.81**. It wasn’t a bankruptcy scare. It wasn’t a huge loss. It wasn’t a customer collapse. It was mostly **timing** \\- a large contract didn’t ship hardware during the quarter, so revenue looked soft even though the orders are still there. Today the stock is hovering around **$15.79**. Meanwhile, the company’s free cash flow is the strongest it’s ever been This is the part that caught my attention. Here’s FCF per share over the past few years: 2021: $0.05, 2022: $0.01, 2023: $0.03, 2024: $0.36, TTM: $0.75 That’s not normal growth. That’s breakout-level improvement. And it’s happening while the price is going the opposite direction. # Even more strange: the stock “looks cheap” with a P/E of ~6… but that number is fake They had a big one-time tax benefit in 2024, which artificially boosted earnings. The **real** way to value this business is through **free cash flow**, because monitoring revenue is recurring and shows up in cash long before it shows up in accounting earnings. For years the company barely generated cash, so P/FCF was ridiculous (180×, 200×, even 400×+). Now that real cash is coming in? **P/FCF is \\~20×** \\- the lowest it has ever been **by a mile**. Not super cheap, not expensive - just finally priced like a real business. Yet the stock is still down 50% from its peak. (keep in min that it still has ZERO debt) **Management says their long-term goal is mid-teens to 20% growth** This year might not hit that, but the industries they serve (data centers, telecom power systems, industrial backup power) are all growing long-term. # So did the market overreact? One lumpy quarter caused a 60% crash… at the same time the company is generating its strongest cash flow ever. My base-case fair value lands around **$18–20**, but curious what others think about the mismatch. Again - not advice, just a pretty interesting example of sentiment vs fundamentals.",

      "selftext_processed": "Not_financial advice just a fascinating valuation case I ’ ve been digging into . A smallcap called Acorn Energy ACFN recently had one of the strangest disconnects I ’ ve seen in a while . Quick background Acorn makes remote monitoring systems for things like backup generators industrial equipment energy systems telecom and data center power setups Basically once their device is installed the customer pays recurring monitoring fees every year . So the business is part hardware part subscription . In September the stock traded a little above $ 30 . After Q3 numbers came out it fell all the way down to $ 12.81 . It wasn ’ t a bankruptcy scare . It wasn ’ t a huge loss . It wasn ’ t a customer collapse . It was mostly timing a large contract didn ’ t ship hardware during the quarter so revenue looked soft even though the orders are still there . Today the stock is hovering around $ 15.79 . Meanwhile the company ’ s free cash flow is the strongest it ’ s ever been This is the part that caught my attention . Here ’ s FCF per share over the past few years 2021 $ 0.05 2022 $ 0.01 2023 $ 0.03 2024 $ 0.36 TTM $ 0.75 That ’ s not_normal growth . That ’ s breakoutlevel improvement . And it ’ s happening while the price is going the opposite direction . Even more strange the stock “ looks cheap ” with a PE of 6… but that number is fake They had a big onetime tax benefit in 2024 which artificially boosted earnings . The real way to value this business is through free cash flow because monitoring revenue is recurring and shows up in cash long before it shows up in accounting earnings . For years the company barely generated cash so PFCF was ridiculous 180× 200× even 400× . Now that real cash is coming in PFCF is 20× the lowest it has ever been by a mile . Not_super cheap not_expensive just finally priced like a real business . Yet the stock is still down 50 % from its peak . keep in min that it still has ZERO debt Management says their longterm goal is midteens to 20 % growth This year might not_hit that but the industries they serve data centers telecom power systems industrial backup power are all growing longterm . So did the market overreact One lumpy quarter caused a 60 % crash… at the same time the company is generating its strongest cash flow ever . My basecase fair value lands around $ 18–20 but curious what others think about the mismatch . Again not_advice just a pretty interesting example of sentiment vs fundamentals ."

      "selftext": "Not investment advice to buy. I own shares. Seems like a classic value unlocking play. Why interesting and boring? Well first of all it’s a conglomerate, hence probably wont explode and isn’t for day trading. Interesting? I’ll explain below. They already spun off the materials business back in Oct 2025. Since then the spinoff went up 3% but Honeywell went down 6%. The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace. Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company. Also nobody talks about the quantum stake. They own 54% of Quantinuum. Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price. Quantum computing might be the next AI play? Maybe? Quantinuum might IPO in 2027. Price targets 230-260 USD. Now at 191. The fundementals seem fair here. Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5% dividend. Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow. Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play. Anyone else buying?",

Why interesting and boring Well first of all it ’ s a conglomerate hence probably wont explode and isn ’ t for day trading . Interesting I ’ ll explain below . They already spun off the materials business back in Oct 2025 . Since then the spinoff went up 3 % but Honeywell went down 6 % . The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace . Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company . Also nobody_talks about the quantum stake . They own 54 % of Quantinuum . Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $ 5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price . Quantum computing might be the next AI play Maybe Quantinuum might IPO in 2027 . Price targets 230260 USD . Now at 191 . The fundementals seem fair here . Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5 % dividend . Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow . Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play . Anyone else buying"

An older coworker mentioned that interest rates were in the double digits as well but it would be worth it for me as someone not trying to buy a house. I guess I’m just wondering if folks here think it’s possible for rates to get to that level again. Even 5-6% APY would be amazing. Mainly because I’d love a risk free way to save. Right now, everything except my emergency fund is in the stock market, which has treated me well but I know that that money is not super liquid and the market can drop at any time. In 2023/4, I had a 5.1% CD and just wish we had that option (or better) all the time. It’s stressful having to invest in the stock market just to keep up with inflation since HYSA rates are not very HY. EDIT: I didn’t know inflation was 12% during the same time period.

      "title": "Sweetgreen Bagholder soon to become Bagholder of that Sweet, Sweet Green",
      "selftext": "I’ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen ($SG) for a while now, and if you listen to the headlines, you’d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy. The current sentiment is that we are in a \"slop bowl recession\", but I thought the market was missing something huge, so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations (Rebecca Nounou) and went deep down the rabbit hole. After looking at the tech, the macro setup, and the insane float structure, I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward plays in the market right now. Here is the full breakdown. # The \"Slop\" Narrative vs. Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced \"slop\" that consumers are abandoning. I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping. I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist (someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera) to analyze the bowls. We concluded that it's probably not slop, given the ingredients, verified local sourcing, exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil, and complex recipes. While the internet calls it slop, the actual product is \"premium casual.\" IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too, citing the specific family farms they support. The point here is that the product moat is real; nobody else is doing farm-to-table supply chains at this scale. They aren't just reheating Sysco bags. # Scale & Fixing Operations (The \"Infinite Kitchen\") This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on. The number one complaint about $SG is portion inconsistency; the dreaded \"skimp.\" Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the **Infinite Kitchen**. These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight. They can crank out 500 meals an hour. I asked Rebecca about this, and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error. But it’s not just about happier customers; it’s about \"Economic Complexity.\" Think about Nokia. Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees, then pivoted to rubber, then to tech. They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology. Sweetgreen is doing the same thing. The market values them like a lemonade stand, but they are building a proprietary robotics platform. They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms, and if it works, their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry. Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen, Spyce Technology, to Wonder. Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founder/CEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space. SG got a $100m lifeline and about a 1.2% in Wonder. They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost + 5%. So as Wonder scales the tech, SG will disproportionately benefit. # The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025. Consumer sentiment is trash, tariffs are flying, and the K-shaped economy is squeezing the middle class. IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 25-35-year-old cohort trade down. They are losing the \"entry-level white collar\" lunch crowd in coastal cities. However, I think this is temporary. There's a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front. The price of real assets is rising, like gold, and stocks, and the fed is cutting rates, stimulating the economy. You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward \"Longevity.\" We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson, Oura Rings, and seed-oil disrespect. Health is the primary status symbol right now. People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food. There is a massive \"Trade Up\" happening where people are leaving generic fast food for \"clean eating.\" Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment, not just calories. The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear. # Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out. First, the margins. Last year they achieve 20% restaurant-level margins, so they can get back there. Also, the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least, according to performance of existing IK-fitted stores. They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs, which lowers occupancy costs. If they execute, they can get to mid-20% restaurant-level margins (Chipotle territory). Second, the cash. They ended Q3 with about $130M, but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $100M plus equity. That puts their liquidity around $230M. Based on their current burn, they have runway through 2027. They aren't going insolvent. They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 15-20 next year to focus only on \"A+ real estate.\" Finally, the main thing they need to drive down is G&A, which is currently way higher than peers at 18%. The sale of Spyce does lower this 2-3% points right away, and there are other levers to pull. Sweetgreen also recently hired an ex-Chipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins. # Meme Potential (Seriously) There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards. I looked at the ownership structure. 95% of Sweetgreen’s shares are held by institutions and insiders. That means the actual \"float\" available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5% of the company. On top of that, 25% of the float is short. This is a powder keg. Because the tradable supply is so low, any spike in demand (from a good earnings beat or a macro shift) creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts. There just aren't enough shares available to buy back. We’ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted, low-float stocks. Finally, there's an invite-only membership tier called having \"Goat Status\". Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up, among other perks. Who in their right mind wouldn't want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT??? *(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence. I am long $SG)*",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen $ SG for a while now and if you listen to the headlines you ’ d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy . The current sentiment is that we are in a slop bowl recession but I thought the market was missing something huge so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations Rebecca Nounou and went deep down the rabbit hole . After looking at the tech the macro setup and the insane float structure I think this is one of the most asymmetric riskreward plays in the market right now . Here is the full breakdown . The Slop Narrative vs . Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced slop that consumers are abandoning . I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping . I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera to analyze the bowls . We concluded that its probably not_slop given the ingredients verified local sourcing exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil and complex recipes . While the internet calls it slop the actual product is premium casual . IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too citing the specific family farms they support . The point here is that the product moat is real nobody_else is doing farmtotable supply chains at this scale . They arent just reheating Sysco bags . Scale Fixing Operations The Infinite Kitchen This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on . The number one complaint about $ SG is portion inconsistency the dreaded skimp . Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the Infinite Kitchen . These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight . They can crank out 500 meals an hour . I asked Rebecca about this and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error . But it ’ s not_just about happier customers it ’ s about Economic Complexity . Think about Nokia . Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees then pivoted to rubber then to tech . They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology . Sweetgreen is doing the same thing . The market values them like a lemonade stand but they are building a proprietary robotics platform . They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms and if it works their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry . Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen Spyce Technology to Wonder . Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founderCEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space . SG got a $ 100m lifeline and about a 1.2 % in Wonder . They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost 5 % . So as Wonder scales the tech SG will disproportionately benefit . The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025 . Consumer sentiment is trash tariffs are flying and the Kshaped economy is squeezing the middle class . IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 2535yearold cohort trade down . They are losing the entrylevel white collar lunch crowd in coastal cities . However I think this is temporary . Theres a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front . The price of real assets is rising like gold and stocks and the fed is cutting rates stimulating the economy . You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward Longevity . We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson Oura Rings and seedoil disrespect . Health is the primary status symbol right now . People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food . There is a massive Trade Up happening where people are leaving generic fast food for clean eating . Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment not_just calories . The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear . Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out . First the margins . Last year they achieve 20 % restaurantlevel margins so they can get back there . Also the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least according to performance of existing IKfitted stores . They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs which lowers occupancy costs . If they execute they can get to mid20 % restaurantlevel margins Chipotle territory . Second the cash . They ended Q3 with about $ 130M but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $ 100M plus equity . That puts their liquidity around $ 230M . Based on their current burn they have runway through 2027 . They arent going insolvent . They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 1520 next year to focus only on A real estate . Finally the main thing they need to drive down is GA which is currently way higher than peers at 18 % . The sale of Spyce does lower this 23 % points right away and there are other levers to pull . Sweetgreen also recently hired an exChipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins . Meme Potential Seriously There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards . I looked at the ownership structure . 95 % of Sweetgreen ’ s shares are held by institutions and insiders . That means the actual float available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5 % of the company . On top of that 25 % of the float is short . This is a powder keg . Because the tradable supply is so low any spike in demand from a good earnings beat or a macro shift creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts . There just arent enough shares available to buy back . We ’ ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted lowfloat stocks . Finally theres an inviteonly membership tier called having Goat Status . Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up among other perks . Who in their right mind wouldnt want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT Disclaimer This is not_financial advice . Do your own due diligence . I am long $ SG"

It could be new ipos like spcx - SpaceX, databricks, Anduril, midline etc or some new companies off the radar but can make a comeback or some undervalued companies which until 2025 haven’t achieved much but will have lots of updates in 2026 - still RKLB and ASTS and NBIS will have lots of opportunities this year to rise even further. So, let’s have a thread for 2026 uolooooing. Also, are there new industries popping up which one is aware of. Thanks in advance.",

Using Zacks.com’s stock screener, I downloaded all public stocks with: (1) market cap above $100 billion, (2) TTM operating margin above 0%, and (3) revenue growth forecast above 0%. This screen gave me 118 stocks.

I consider a Value Score above 2.0 as a potential Buy. A Value Score below 1.0 is considered overpriced and a potential Sell. Some of the standout stocks are well-known including NVDA, TSM, NVO and MU. I’ve written before about the financial stocks SCHW and V as potential BUYs. Unfortunately, the market has not yet come around on these ones. One big caveat is that Zacks is a free stock screener and has plenty of outdated or incorrect data.

Or is the writing on the wall for a crash? I just saw a post detailing ORCL bond issues and another claiming AI trade is dead. Which side are you on and why?",

The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, and Goldman executives are already calling buffer ETFs a major growth area for the industry. Given how volatile markets have been and how nervous a lot of investors feel about valuations going into 2026 it’s not hard to see why. Feels like another sign that big asset managers are positioning for a world where investors care less about max returns and more about risk management.

      "selftext": "We've been living with social media for close to 20 years now, and have willingly given the companies our data in exchange for interaction and entertainment. Generally, we accept that they profit by selling our data for targeted ads. I used to buy dark ads though META's Ad Manager in 2019. It started out very effective, but over time I watched the (non-bot) engagement go down while the price per click continued to go up. I haven't bought ads in over a year, but a quick search says the average cost per click is now around $.50. I was paying less than $.10 for a while there. As more and more ads were sold, it made greater competition for ad space and the rate went up - Easy to see how META makes a ton of money with this model. But doesn't it seem like FB/IG has begun to run its course as far as people wanting to use it? How and why do you see it maintaining and growing the Ad revenue in the long term? What's META platform gonna look like in 3 years? I think unless its something completely different, a lot of people will continue to check out. Lately there's a lot of resentment/backlash/reluctance (at least by non-boomers) to reduce our exposure to social media; as we now know the companies intentionally fuel societal/political division, contribute to emotional damage in kids. It seems that less people are posting personal content on a regular basis, sharing less. This makes the 'digital creators' who think the world needs to hear from them every day a larger part of the feed alongside all the paid Ad content. FB/IG are just less engaging than they once were. Unless you're watching reels - which, like tiktok just sucks people into an addictive and mindless loop of 10 second videos leading to 'brain-rot' - People are finally recognizing the harm of social media. Have a look at Australia's new social media ban for kids - coming soon to US. What impact will this have on META ad sales? I just don't see how it continues to grow with so many forces against it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. TLDR \\~ I don't think META will continue to increase revenue. They might even be the company that doesn't make it through the AI bubble.",

      "selftext_processed": "Weve been living with social media for close to 20 years now and have willingly given the companies our data in exchange for interaction and entertainment . Generally we accept that they profit by selling our data for targeted ads . I used to buy dark ads though METAs Ad Manager in 2019 . It started out very effective but over time I watched the nonbot engagement go down while the price per click continued to go up . I havent bought ads in over a year but a quick search says the average cost per click is now around $ .50 . I was paying less than $ .10 for a while there . As more and more ads were sold it made greater competition for ad space and the rate went up Easy to see how META makes a ton of money with this model . But doesnt it seem like FBIG has begun to run its course as far as people wanting to use it How and why do you see it maintaining and growing the Ad revenue in the long term Whats META platform gon na look like in 3 years I think unless its something completely different a lot of people will continue to check out . Lately theres a lot of resentmentbacklashreluctance at least by nonboomers to reduce our exposure to social media as we now know the companies intentionally fuel societalpolitical division contribute to emotional damage in kids . It seems that less people are posting personal content on a regular basis sharing less . This makes the digital creators who think the world needs to hear from them every day a larger part of the feed alongside all the paid Ad content . FBIG are just less engaging than they once were . Unless youre watching reels which like tiktok just sucks people into an addictive and mindless loop of 10 second videos leading to brainrot People are finally recognizing the harm of social media . Have a look at Australias new social media ban for kids coming soon to US . What impact will this have on META ad sales I just dont see how it continues to grow with so many forces against it . Thanks for coming to my TED talk . TLDR I dont think META will continue to increase revenue . They might even be the company that doesnt make it through the AI bubble ."

      "selftext": "Most of the headlines this week focused on Todd Combs leaving Berkshire Hathaway, but the broader message in the announcement matters just as much. The company is clearly transitioning toward a more traditional corporate structure as Warren Buffett prepares to hand over the CEO role to Greg Abel in a matter of weeks. Combs, who joined Berkshire in 2010 and later became CEO of GEICO, is heading to JPMorgan Chase to run a new $10 billion Strategic Investment Group tied to its massive $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative. It’s a big vote of confidence from JPM, and even Buffett acknowledged the move, saying JPMorgan “made a good decision.” Beyond Combs, the personnel changes suggest Berkshire is tightening roles and formalizing leadership in a way that feels very different from the loose, Buffett-centric setup of the past. That doesn’t mean the culture is gone but it does mean the era of Berkshire running purely on Buffett’s instincts is ending. Feels less like a sudden shift and more like a careful, deliberate handoff. Curious how others see it: smooth evolution, or the beginning of a very different Berkshire? Source:",

      "selftext": "# FLWS: The Liquidity Math - What Actually Moves This Stock **TL;DR:** FLWS has a mechanical squeeze setup with verifiable numbers. 9.4M shares short vs only 500K available to borrow = **18.8x imbalance**. Shorts used 84% of their ammo and someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday. But this isn't just a squeeze play - it's a **$1.7B revenue company trading at 0.17x sales** ($285M market cap). That's priced for bankruptcy, but they're generating $93M EBITDA with new leadership (first non-family CEO + AI-focused CIO). The squeeze is the catalyst. The valuation is the floor. # SECTION 1: THE SETUP (VERIFIED DATA) Let me start with what we actually know: |Metric|Value|Source| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |Short Interest|9.4M shares|FINRA (Nov 28)| |Available to Borrow|**500K**|Fintel (Dec 13)| |Imbalance Ratio|**18.8x**|Math| |Average Daily Volume|560K-700K|Yahoo Finance| |Dec 9 Catalyst Volume|6.3M shares|Yahoo Finance| |Dec 12 Short Attack|2.5M borrowed|iBorrowDesk| **Sources:** * Fintel: [ * iBorrowDesk: [ * FINRA: [ # SECTION 2: WHAT MOVED THE PRICE LAST WEEK Here's actual price action data from the past 5 trading days: |Date|Volume|Price Move|Direction| |:-|:-|:-|:-| || ||||| ||||| |Dec 6 (Fri)|487K|\\+$0.03 (+0.8%)|Flat| |Dec 9 (Mon)|6.3M|\\+$1.24 (+33%)|Catalyst spike| |Dec 10 (Tue)|2.1M|\\-$0.17 (-3.4%)|Pullback| |Dec 11 (Wed)|1.1M|\\-$0.33 (-7.0%)|Continued pullback| |Dec 12 (Thu)|2.8M|\\-$0.49 (-9.8%)|Short attack| **Key observations:** 1. **Dec 9:** 6.3M volume (11x average) = +33% move 2. **Dec 12:** 2.5M shares borrowed for concentrated selling = only -9.8% move, held $3.90 support # SECTION 3: THE ASYMMETRY This is the important part. **Buying pressure and selling pressure don't have equal impact right now.** **Why selling is becoming less effective:** |Factor|Status| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Borrow inventory remaining|**500K** (down from 3.2M)| |% of ammo used|**84% depleted**| |Support level|$3.90 defended twice| |Natural sellers|None visible (insiders accumulating)| **Why buying is becoming more effective:** |Factor|Status| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Shares available to absorb buying|Limited (thin float)| |Gamma ramp|Max concentration at $5 strike| |Options expiration|Dec 19 (6 days)| |T+35 settlement window|Dec 16-18| # SECTION 4: THE VOLUME MATH Let's look at what different volume levels have historically done: **Normal conditions (no squeeze setup):** |Net Buying Volume|Typical Impact| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |100K shares|\\+0.5-1.0%| |250K shares|\\+1.0-2.0%| |500K shares|\\+2.0-4.0%| |1M shares|\\+4.0-7.0%| **Current conditions (squeeze setup active):** |Net Buying Volume|Estimated Impact|Why Different| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |100K shares|\\+1.0-2.0%|Limited short ammo to counter| |250K shares|\\+2.5-5.0%|Delta hedging kicks in| |500K shares|\\+5.0-10.0%|Approaches $5 gamma zone| |1M shares|\\+10-20%+|Potential cascade trigger| **The multiplier effect:** Once price approaches $5, market makers holding short calls must hedge by buying shares. This creates a feedback loop: Price rises → MM buys to hedge → Price rises more → MM buys more → Repeat At the $5 strike, there are **3,476 interest calls** with **0.36 gamma**. That's significant hedging pressure waiting to activate. # SECTION 5: THE SUPPLY SIDE **Who's NOT selling:** |Holder|Shares|Why They Won't Sell| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |McCann Family (Class B)|\\~27M|Family business, never sell| |Insiders|133K just granted|Accumulating, not dumping| |Fund 1 Investments|\\~5.4M|Buying back after Oct sale| |Long institutions|\\~20M+|Passive holders| **Estimated real tradeable float:** 10-15M shares **Current short interest as % of tradeable float:** 63-94% # SECTION 6: THE BORROW SITUATION This is real-time data from Fintel and iBorrowDesk: |Date/Time|Available|Fee|Change| |:-|:-|:-|:-| || ||||| ||||| |Dec 11 AM|3,000,000|2.94%|\\-| |Dec 11 PM|3,100,000|2.94%|\\+100K| |Dec 12 8 AM|3,200,000|2.94%|\\+100K| |Dec 12 12 PM|600,000|2.96%|**-2,600,000**| |Dec 12 4 PM|650,000|2.96%|\\+50K| |Dec 12 7 PM|600,000|2.96%|\\-50K| |**Dec 13 2 AM**|**500,000**|**2.96%**|**-100K**| **What this means:** Shorts borrowed 2.6M shares on Thursday and couldn't push price below $3.90. Then **someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday** \\- on a weekend, ahead of Monday. That's not normal hedging. That's someone loading up for Monday. For context, **500K shares is less than one day's average volume.** If buying pressure exceeds their remaining ammo, they have no way to suppress the price. # SECTION 7: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK **Converging factors Dec 16-19:** |Date|Event|Implication| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |Dec 16-18|T+35 settlement window|FTDs from Nov must settle| |Dec 19|Options expiration|Max gamma at $5, all Dec calls expire| |All week|Low borrow inventory|Limited short suppression ability| **The math on T+35:** High volume days in early November (Nov 11-13) hit their T+35 settlement deadline Dec 16-18. Any failures to deliver from those days must be resolved, which means forced buying. # SECTION 8: PUTTING IT TOGETHER **Current state:** * 9.4M shares short * **500K available to borrow** * **18.8x imbalance** * $3.90 support held * Gamma ramp at $5 * 6 days to expiration **The squeeze trigger math:** To push from current price (\\~$3.90) to the $5 gamma zone requires \\~28% move. Based on last week's data: * Dec 9 saw +33% on 6.3M volume * But most of that was spread throughout the day **Concentrated buying is more effective than dispersed buying.** Dec 12 showed us shorts can throw 2.5M shares at it in a concentrated attack and only move it 9%. The inverse should also be true - concentrated buying into limited supply creates outsized moves. # SECTION 9: WHAT THIS POST ISN'T I'm not telling anyone to buy anything. I'm not coordinating anything. I'm presenting publicly available data and doing basic math. **What you do with this information is your own decision.** I hold a position (400 shares + calls) because I believe the math favors longs. You might look at the same data and disagree. That's fine. # SECTION 10: THE RISKS **Squeeze-specific risks:** |Risk|How It Affects The Squeeze| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |New borrow inventory appears|Shorts get more ammo| |Large holder dumps|Creates supply for shorts| |Price breaks $3.80 on volume|Support failure| |No buying materializes|Time decay kills options| |Shorts cover slowly in dark pools|Pressure release valve| **Fundamental risks:** FLWS does have real challenges: * $262M debt * Declining revenue (-11% YoY) * Recent quarterly losses **BUT here's why I'm also long-term bullish:** |Factor|Why It Matters| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |$1.7B revenue|Real business, real customers| |0.17x P/S ratio|Priced for bankruptcy (they're not bankrupt)| |$93M Adj. EBITDA (FY24)|Generating real cash from operations| |New leadership|First non-family CEO + new CMO + new CIO (AI focus)| |10M+ customers|Retention engine (74% repeat revenue)| |Insider accumulation|SVP just granted 133K shares| **The way I see it:** |Scenario|Outcome| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Squeeze works|Big win| |Squeeze doesn't work|I own a $2B revenue company at all-time lows with new leadership executing a turnaround| |Bankruptcy|I lose (but they're generating EBITDA, so unlikely)| **Two out of three outcomes are favorable.** The squeeze is the catalyst, but the valuation is the margin of safety. This isn't just a trade - it's asymmetric risk/reward with a long-term floor. # SECTION 11: SOURCES All data is publicly verifiable: 1. **Short Interest:** [ 2. **Borrow Availability:** [ 3. **Borrow Availability (alternate):** [ 4. **Options Chain:** [ 5. **Price/Volume:** [ 6. **Insider Filings:** SEC EDGAR # MY POSITION Full transparency: 400 shares + 174 calls (Dec 19 expiry) Total cost basis: \\~$4,900 **My plan:** The calls are my squeeze lottery ticket. The shares are my long-term position. If the squeeze doesn't materialize, I'll be adding to shares and holding for the turnaround. At 0.17x sales with new leadership, I believe the floor is well above current prices. I'm biased. Do your own research. **DISCLAIMER:** This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Options can expire worthless. You can lose 100% of your investment. Past price action does not guarantee future results. Do your own due diligence.",

Shorts used 84 % of their ammo and someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday . But this isnt just a squeeze play its a $ 1.7B revenue company trading at 0.17x sales $ 285M market cap . Thats priced for bankruptcy but theyre generating $ 93M EBITDA with new leadership first nonfamily CEO AIfocused CIO . The squeeze is the catalyst . The valuation is the floor .

Dec 9 6.3M volume 11x average 33 % move 2 . Dec 12 2.5M shares borrowed for concentrated selling only 9.8 % move held $ 3.90 support SECTION 3 THE ASYMMETRY This is the important part . Buying pressure and selling pressure dont have equal impact right now . Why selling is becoming less effective FactorStatus Borrow inventory remaining500K down from 3.2M % of ammo used84 % depleted Support level $ 3.90 defended twice Natural sellersNone visible insiders accumulating Why buying is becoming more effective FactorStatus Shares available to absorb buyingLimited thin float Gamma rampMax concentration at $ 5 strike Options expirationDec 19 6 days T35 settlement windowDec 1618 SECTION 4 THE VOLUME MATH Lets look at what different volume levels have historically done Normal conditions no squeeze setup Net Buying VolumeTypical Impact 100K shares0.51.0 % 250K shares1.02.0 % 500K shares2.04.0 % 1M shares4.07.0 % Current conditions squeeze setup active Net Buying VolumeEstimated ImpactWhy Different 100K shares1.02.0 % Limited short ammo to counter 250K shares2.55.0 % Delta hedging kicks in 500K shares5.010.0 % Approaches $ 5 gamma zone 1M shares1020 % Potential cascade trigger The multiplier effect Once price approaches $ 5 market makers holding short calls must hedge by buying shares . This creates a feedback loop Price rises → MM buys to hedge → Price rises more → MM buys more → Repeat At the $ 5 strike there are 3476 interest calls with 0.36 gamma . Thats significant hedging pressure waiting to activate . SECTION 5 THE SUPPLY SIDE Whos NOT_selling HolderSharesWhy They Wont Sell McCann Family Class B27MFamily business never_sell Insiders133K just grantedAccumulating not_dumping Fund 1 Investments5.4MBuying back after Oct sale Long institutions20MPassive holders Estimated real tradeable float 1015M shares Current short interest as % of tradeable float 6394 % SECTION 6 THE BORROW SITUATION This is realtime data from Fintel and iBorrowDesk DateTimeAvailableFeeChange Dec 11 AM30000002.94 % Dec 11 PM31000002.94 % 100K Dec 12 8 AM32000002.94 % 100K Dec 12 12 PM6000002.96 % 2600000 Dec 12 4 PM6500002.96 % 50K Dec 12 7 PM6000002.96 % 50K Dec 13 2 AM5000002.96 % 100K What this means Shorts borrowed 2.6M shares on Thursday and couldnt push price below $ 3.90 . Then someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday on a weekend ahead of Monday . Thats not_normal hedging . Thats someone loading up for Monday . For context 500K shares is less than one days average volume . If buying pressure exceeds their remaining ammo they have no_way to suppress the price .

SECTION 8 PUTTING IT TOGETHER Current state 9.4M shares short 500K available to borrow 18.8x imbalance $ 3.90 support held Gamma ramp at $ 5 6 days to expiration The squeeze trigger math To push from current price $ 3.90 to the $ 5 gamma zone requires 28 % move . Based on last weeks data Dec 9 saw 33 % on 6.3M volume But most of that was spread throughout the day Concentrated buying is more effective than dispersed buying . Dec 12 showed us shorts can throw 2.5M shares at it in a concentrated attack and only move it 9 % . The inverse should also be true concentrated buying into limited supply creates outsized moves . SECTION 9 WHAT THIS POST ISNT Im not_telling anyone to buy anything . Im not_coordinating anything . Im presenting publicly available data and doing basic math . What you do with this information is your own decision . I hold a position 400 shares calls because I believe the math favors longs . You might look at the same data and disagree . Thats fine .

      "selftext": "Hi, I recently learned about S&P 500 Buffer ETFs from Innovator ETFs. I was mostly interested in PDEC and UDEC. It looks like they have an expense ratio of around 0.79% and cap gains at around 13% for pDEC and buffer S&P500 losses up to 15% and anything beyond that, you would lose money on assuming you hold from December to December annually. UDEC is even crazier and buffers loss from -5% to 35% in the S&P500 with cap around 12% . These are relatively new and wanted to see if anyone had any experience in these ETFs? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi I recently learned about SP 500 Buffer ETFs from Innovator ETFs . I was mostly interested in PDEC and UDEC . It looks like they have an expense ratio of around 0.79 % and cap gains at around 13 % for pDEC and buffer SP500 losses up to 15 % and anything beyond that you would lose money on assuming you hold from December to December annually . UDEC is even crazier and buffers loss from 5 % to 35 % in the SP500 with cap around 12 % . These are relatively new and wanted to see if anyone had any experience in these ETFs Thanks"

My belief is the constant chatter by low brows of an “AI bubble,” on a few platforms, is changing market psychology. It’s anyone’s guess as to when that might turn the corner from fear to greed again. The last time AVGO dipped substantially was tariff week. I picked up 1,200 shares for about $155. I’ve stayed long since and make a steady income selling calls. Another buying opportunity?: This Friday, I used the dip to boost up a position in Vertiv Holdings. The last lot I got for $160.20. If that were to continue Monday, I would buy more. With a peg ratio of 1.3, and a 5 year growth rate projected to be 30+%, I can’t understand how Wolfe Research reduced VRT to peer perform.",

      "title": "TMUS - It is time",
      "selftext": "TMUS, probably the most oversold large cap stock in the market. It consistently bounces off its 150 SMA - shown on a weekly chart here - where it finds itself once again. The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here: Sustained, above-consensus subscriber growth (volume engine): T-Mobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 (millions of net adds across postpaid phone, other and prepaid from acquisitions), with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press. Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue, ARPU stability/upside, and superior churn economics vs. peers. This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows. ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains: T-Mobile built a broad mid-band 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger; that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage + performance, especially for price-sensitive consumers and suburban/rural areas. Faster, cheaper 5G motivates upgrades (premium plans, 5G broadband) and supports new services (fixed 5G broadband, enterprise customers). Company commentary and analysts emphasize its network-driven wins. Diversifying revenue: broadband & fiber tuck-ins T-Mobile is not just phones — they’ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers (e.g., Metronet acquisitions) to scale fixed connectivity offerings. Owning both wireless and fiber/fixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value. ￼ Material free-cash-flow (FCF) tailwinds + aggressive capital returns: Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF; the company just authorized a large $14.6B shareholder return program (through 2026) and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors, supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion. Buybacks + dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return. ￼ Room for margin expansion (profit curve + operating leverage): As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex (once major 5G build is complete) and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers, EBITDA margins can improve. Market commentary and management’s guidance point to steady service revenue growth (high-margin) and improving profitability. ￼ Valuation gap + analyst upside: Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings / price targets in the $275–$280 range, suggesting \\~35–45% upside from current levels, supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns. If the market re-rates T-Mobile nearer to those comps, upside is substantial. ￼ Numbers that matter (evidence-backed): Record net adds / scale: company reported multi-million postpaid adds in Q3 2025 (e.g., 3,287,000 postpaid phone & other adds referenced in the release / press). These are eye-popping numbers that materially grow revenue base. ￼ Service revenue growth: management reported double-digit growth in postpaid service revenue and mid/high single-digit on overall service revenue in recent quarters. That’s a high-quality revenue stream. ￼ Shareholder returns: $14.6B authorized program through 2026 + dividend increase to $1.02 per quarter (recently declared), both compress available shares and increase yield/total return. ￼ Valuation framework & target: Base case (multiple expansion + FCF growth): If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count \\~3–5% annually, the market could re-apply a telecom / growth multiple lift (say from mid-teens to low-20s on EV/EBITDA) as growth proves durable. That supports a move into the $250–$300 range over 12–24 months. (Analyst targets cluster near $275–$280.) ￼ Conservative case: Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → low-double-digit total return from current price (dividend + modest multiple expansion) — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow. Bull case: Continued share gains, ARPU stability, strong fiber/wireless bundling, and aggressive buybacks drive EPS substantially higher — stock re-rates to premium growth multiple → $300+ possible over 18–36 months.",

The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here Sustained aboveconsensus subscriber growth volume engine TMobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 millions of net adds across postpaid phone other and prepaid from acquisitions with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press . Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue ARPU stabilityupside and superior churn economics vs. peers . This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows . ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains TMobile built a broad midband 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage performance especially for pricesensitive consumers and suburbanrural areas . Faster cheaper 5G motivates upgrades premium plans 5G broadband and supports new services fixed 5G broadband enterprise customers . Company commentary and analysts emphasize its networkdriven wins . Diversifying revenue broadband fiber tuckins TMobile is not_just phones — they ’ ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers e.g . Metronet acquisitions to scale fixed connectivity offerings . Owning both wireless and fiberfixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value . ￼ Material freecashflow FCF tailwinds aggressive capital returns Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF the company just authorized a large $ 14.6B shareholder return program through 2026 and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion . Buybacks dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return . ￼ Room for margin expansion profit curve operating leverage As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex once major 5G build is complete and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers EBITDA margins can improve . Market commentary and management ’ s guidance point to steady service revenue growth highmargin and improving profitability . ￼ Valuation gap analyst upside Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings price targets in the $ 275– $ 280 range suggesting 35–45 % upside from current levels supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns . If the market rerates TMobile nearer to those comps upside is substantial . ￼ Numbers that matter evidencebacked Record net adds scale company reported multimillion postpaid adds in Q3 2025 e.g . 3287000 postpaid phone other adds referenced in the release press . These are eyepopping numbers that materially grow revenue base . ￼ Service revenue growth management reported doubledigit growth in postpaid service revenue and midhigh singledigit on overall service revenue in recent quarters .

That supports a move into the $ 250– $ 300 range over 12–24 months . Analyst targets cluster near $ 275– $ 280 . ￼ Conservative case Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → lowdoubledigit total return from current price dividend modest multiple expansion — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow .

      "selftext": "So I’ve been investing on margin on Robinhood and my account is up like 70% all time (around $49k now). I honestly don’t know if I actually did something smart or if I just got lucky and the market carried me. I make around $10k a month so in theory I can handle drops and put more money in if things go bad, but I’m also pretty much fully using my margin right now so I know that could bite me if the market dips hard. I’m just trying to figure out a couple things: 1. Is it smart to keep using margin since I can afford to deal with dips, or should I back off before I get wrecked? 2. If I sell stuff I bought on margin, do I still get taxed on the gains the same way? (I think yes but not 100% sure.) 3. Anyone here actually use margin long term? How do you know when you’re using too much? Not trying to blow myself up but I also don’t wanna pull back too early if using some leverage is fine. Just curious what people who’ve been through this think.",

I honestly don ’ t know if I actually did something smart or if I just got lucky and the market carried me . I make around $ 10k a month so in theory I can handle drops and put more money in if things go bad but I ’ m also pretty much fully using my margin right now so I know that could bite me if the market dips hard . I ’ m just trying to figure out a couple things 1 . Is it smart to keep using margin since I can afford to deal with dips or should I back off before I get wrecked 2 . If I sell stuff I bought on margin do I still get taxed on the gains the same way I think yes but not_100 % sure . 3 . Anyone here actually use margin long term How do you know when you ’ re using too much Not_trying to blow myself up but I also don ’ t wan na pull back too early if using some leverage is fine . Just curious what people who ’ ve been through this think ."

      "selftext": "There is a strong consensus right now for a \"Soft Landing.\" I wanted to stress-test this, so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections (Median Rate) and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies. I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced. **1. The \"Volcker\" Tail Risk (The Bear Case)** Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data, my model flagged a **\"Stagflation Shock\" scenario** with a **12% probability** (based on >2-sigma moves). * **The Trigger:** Core PCE re-accelerating to 4.5%+. * **The Historical Analog:** The **1979-1980 Volcker Pivot**. * **The Transmission Logic:** Usually, high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads. We see this happening in the \"Credit and housing transmission\" channel (mortgage rates cooling demand). **2. The \"Nominal\" Trap (The Bull Case)** However, Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal. It triggered a **\"Red Flag\" for Nominal vs. Real Divergence.** * **The Issue:** We are seeing a surge in nominal spend, but historically (2000-2020), hardware prices *fall* due to hedonic adjustments. The \"Real\" capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests. * **Concentration Risk:** The top 10 firms now account for **\\~40%** of this entire category. This isn't a broad recovery; it's a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates. **The Conclusion** We have a \"Two-Speed Economy.\" The Fed is hitting the brakes (Housing/Credit), but the \"Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration\" loop in Tech is hitting the gas. If that 12% Stagflation scenario plays out, the Fed can't cut. If they can't cut, the Tech valuation multiple (which assumes falling discount rates) is at risk. **Visuals:** I've attached the \"Shock Scenario\" and \"Red Flag\" cards below so you can see the risk breakdown. [* **Discussion:** Is anyone hedging for a 1979-style pivot? Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure?",

I wanted to stresstest this so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections Median Rate and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies . I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced . 1 . The Volcker Tail Risk The Bear Case Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data my model flagged a Stagflation Shock scenario with a 12 % probability based on 2sigma moves . The Trigger Core PCE reaccelerating to 4.5 % . The Historical Analog The 19791980 Volcker Pivot . The Transmission Logic Usually high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads . We see this happening in the Credit and housing transmission channel mortgage rates cooling demand . 2 . The Nominal Trap The Bull Case However Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal . It triggered a Red Flag for Nominal vs. Real Divergence . The Issue We are seeing a surge in nominal spend but historically 20002020 hardware prices fall due to hedonic adjustments . The Real capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests . Concentration Risk The top 10 firms now account for 40 % of this entire category . This isnt a broad recovery its a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates . The Conclusion We have a TwoSpeed Economy . The Fed is hitting the brakes HousingCredit but the Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration loop in Tech is hitting the gas . If that 12 % Stagflation scenario plays out the Fed cant cut . If they cant cut the Tech valuation multiple which assumes falling discount rates is at risk . Visuals Ive attached the Shock Scenario and Red Flag cards below so you can see the risk breakdown . Discussion Is anyone hedging for a 1979style pivot Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure"

      "selftext": "Currently SGOV has a 3.82% 30 day SEC yield. Since we just had a rate cut I expect that number to go down slightly over the next month. Looking into 2026, the consensus is that there is going to be at least 1 fed rate cut. High Yield Savings Accounts usually drop in the same way that the Fed funds rate drops. With one cut, that would bring top HYSAs to 3.25% APY. But, according to AI: Forecast for 91-day (3-month) Treasury yields shows: ~3.64% in Jan 2026 ~3.11% by Mar 2026 ~2.69% by Apr ~2.16% by Jun ~1.95% by Jul Does this mean we will be seeing SGOV yielding 2% by July even though the fed funds rate is stable with likely only one more cut? With typical savings accounts, they usually fall by the same percentage as the fed funds rate, but it appears that SGOV would fall by more than a percent more. Is that because unlike savings accounts, treasuries are tied to the yield curve?",

And what really got my attention is the pace of the accumulation, because to me it doesnt look like speculative grab at all, it feels more like a slow and confident additions from a traditional institution that is sticking to what they know it works, looking like just the kind of those moves that usually reflects a deeper conviction even if it does not come out in the filing. On a side note, i realized alot of talks about how tradfi and crypto are trying to blend over time, now that bitget is trying to expand more into TradFi, so it made me curious what people here can say regarding that, because to me if exchanges start bringing more traditional financial options into their platforms i have these few questions that i would like to know, is that going to be useful for more tokenized assets? Better market data? Or is there something completely different? And I am genuinely interested to know what would make a TradFi meeting crypto setup worth using.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “patch” today’s system. The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity. That power comes from continuous trading, speed advantages, spread control, and real-time visibility into order flow. If you remove any one of those, they adapt. So the question isn’t “how do we punish MMs,” it’s “how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they’re supposed to do.” Here’s what a cleaner, fairer market would actually look like mechanically. First, get rid of continuous time. Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds. All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price. This instantly kills latency arbitrage, quote stuffing, and microsecond front-running. Speed stops being a weapon. Price competition replaces reaction time. Second, make order intake blind during each batch. No visible book, no stop inference, no cancel-replace signaling. Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears. This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price. Third, crowd sets the price first. Market makers do not quote prices. They do not step ahead. The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent. Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in, and only at the already-determined clearing price. They act as buffers, not drivers. Fourth, change how MMs get paid. No spread capture. No pinning incentives. Instead, they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed, plus a volatility-adjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large. They are compensated for absorbing risk, not for slowing price discovery or farming chop. Fifth, hard caps on inventory and leverage. Market makers cannot accumulate directional exposure. They must neutralize inventory within defined windows. This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed. Sixth, separate and slow the options market structurally. Options clear in longer batches. Hedging references prior clears, not instant ticks. This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “max pain” dynamics that distort the underlying. Seventh, retail execution becomes predictable. Everyone in the batch gets the same price. Worst-case slippage is known in advance. Orders either fill cleanly or don’t fill at all. You still take risk, but you’re not punished for being slower than an algorithm. Finally, stress is handled honestly. When volatility spikes, batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen. Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes. Compared to today, the difference is stark. Right now, markets reward speed, opacity, leverage, and time-based exploitation. In this design, markets reward conviction, patience, and real supply-demand alignment. Market makers still exist, but their power is capped by architecture, not by trust or regulation. You don’t eliminate intermediaries. You remove their ability to dominate price. Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “ patch ” today ’ s system . The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity . That power comes from continuous trading speed advantages spread control and realtime visibility into order flow . If you remove any one of those they adapt . So the question isn ’ t “ how do we punish MMs ” it ’ s “ how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they ’ re supposed to do. ” Here ’ s what a cleaner fairer market would actually look like mechanically . First get rid of continuous time . Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds . All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price . This instantly kills latency arbitrage quote stuffing and microsecond frontrunning . Speed stops being a weapon . Price competition replaces reaction time . Second make order intake blind during each batch . No_visible book no_stop inference no_cancelreplace signaling . Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears . This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price . Third crowd sets the price first . Market makers do not_quote prices . They do not_step ahead . The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent . Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in and only at the alreadydetermined clearing price . They act as buffers not_drivers . Fourth change how MMs get paid . No_spread capture . No_pinning incentives . Instead they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed plus a volatilityadjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large . They are compensated for absorbing risk not_for slowing price discovery or farming chop . Fifth hard caps on inventory and leverage . Market makers can not accumulate directional exposure . They must neutralize inventory within defined windows . This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed . Sixth separate and slow the options market structurally . Options clear in longer batches . Hedging references prior clears not_instant ticks . This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “ max pain ” dynamics that distort the underlying . Seventh retail execution becomes predictable . Everyone in the batch gets the same price . Worstcase slippage is known in advance . Orders either fill cleanly or don ’ t fill at all . You still take risk but you ’ re not_punished for being slower than an algorithm . Finally stress is handled honestly . When volatility spikes batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen . Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes . Compared to today the difference is stark . Right now markets reward speed opacity leverage and timebased exploitation . In this design markets reward conviction patience and real supplydemand alignment . Market makers still exist but their power is capped by architecture not_by trust or regulation . You don ’ t eliminate intermediaries . You remove their ability to dominate price . Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it ."

We are conditioned to believe US equities always bounce back and keep compounding. But history shows that long flat or negative decades do happen even in major developed markets. Japan is the clearest example. From 1990 to 2010 the Nikkei 225 delivered an annualized return of about minus 4.5 percent. That was not a short downturn. It was two full decades where buy and hold did not work the way people expected. Apollo’s argument is largely valuation driven. When forward price to earnings ratios are elevated future returns tend to compress. The data shows a strong relationship between starting valuation and ten year outcomes and at current levels that math points toward very low returns. Thoughts??",

      "selftext": "Oracle (ORCL) has declined roughly 15% over the past two sessions despite reporting continued strength in cloud infrastructure growth. The market reaction appears less related to demand and more to capital intensity and timing. Oracle is investing heavily in AI-focused data center capacity to support customers such as OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia. While backlog and bookings are strong, near-term free cash flow has turned negative as capital expenditures accelerate, and management has guided that meaningful returns may take several years to materialize. This raises a broader question about AI-related equities, particularly within the NASDAQ: * Is the market beginning to reprice AI investments based on cash flow timing rather than long-term demand? * Does Oracle represent a long-term opportunity once spending normalizes, or is the stock likely to remain range-bound until free cash flow improves? * More broadly, could this signal increased scrutiny across AI-heavy companies with elevated capital requirements? For those interested, here are two perspectives I found useful for context: * Barron’s discussion of Oracle’s balance sheet and credit risk - [Oracle Stock Slumps. Why Its ‘CDS’ Are Spooking Investors. - Barron's]( * Baptista Research's analysis outlining both the bullish and bearish cases for Oracle’s AI strategy - [ I am interested in how others here are thinking about AI exposure within the NASDAQ given recent price action and valuation levels.",

You can only realize this once you see your wallet drop that amount why are these interfaces so diabolically misleading for newbies ?

You can only realize this once you see your wallet drop that amount why are these interfaces so diabolically misleading for newbies I mean for god sake it is asking confirmation to buy something actually show the freaking amount youll pay or put an indicator like x100 somewhere"

      "selftext": "NVDA is considering ramping up production of its H200 AI chips amid strong demand from China. Leading Chinese tech companies including Alibaba (BABA) and ByteDance (BDNCE) have approached NVDA to discuss chip purchases and are expected to place large orders. However, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the Chinese government has yet to decide whether to allow these chips to be shipped to China. NVDA currently produces limited quantities of H200 chips, as it has prioritized developing its new Blackwell and Rubin chips. The Trump administration earlier this week approved sales of H200 chips to China, ending an export ban imposed over national security concerns.

Coinbase (COIN) plans to launch prediction markets and tokenized stock products, with the company set to release these offerings on December 17. Its tokenized stocks will be issued internally rather than through partners.",

The stock still sold off, moving lower alongside other AI-linked names like Oracle and CoreWeave. The common theme seems to be AI infrastructure fatigue. Investors are starting to question how much near-term pain companies will absorb to build out massive AI capacity. In Broadcom’s case, analysts are pointing to margin pressure in the short term, driven by heavy spending on networking and infrastructure tied to AI demand. This wasn’t about Broadcom missing numbers it’s more about expectations resetting across the AI supply chain. After a long stretch where “AI exposure” was enough to support valuations, the market now wants to see clearer profitability timelines. Feels like we’re entering a phase where AI stocks still need to execute perfectly, not just promise growth. Curious if this is a temporary digestion phase or the start of a broader re-rating across AI infrastructure plays. Source:",

They’ve got teams, analysts, all that good stuff, while I’m just chasing headlines. And let’s talk about emotions. Stock pops, you wanna buy, but that’s when it usually drops. Institutions? They’re sitting back, sipping iced tea, not even sweating. Institutions are always a few steps ahead. Anyone else take a big hit like that?

      "title": "AVGO's earnings exceeded expectations, so why did its stock price plummet? The hidden concerns behind the AI ​​boom.",
      "selftext": "AVGO's earnings report is out, showing revenue of $18 billion, a 28% increase, and net profit of $9.7 billion, a 39% increase. Both figures represent all-time highs, with AI chips being the absolute growth engine. EPS was a high $1.95, a 37% increase, and the gross profit margin was 68%. All the data significantly exceeded market expectations. However, the stock price performance was interesting, rising initially and then falling. It dropped 5% after hours yesterday. The reason is simple: the strong earnings report had already been priced into the market. AVGO's stock has already risen 80% this year, so today's earnings report was a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" situation. While there's a logic of buying expectations, that logic isn't working here. In other words, the future performance guidance is weak. Specifically, Broadcom currently has $73 billion in backlogged orders to be delivered over the next six quarters. The company's top five customers are Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Anthropic accounts for $21 billion of the unfulfilled orders, while OpenAI only accounts for $1 billion. The remaining orders, approximately $51 billion, come from Google and other major customers, averaging only $8.5 billion per quarter. However, the company's guidance for the next quarter is already $8.2 billion, meaning there will be almost no growth in the next five quarters. The market will certainly think that the next five quarters will be mediocre, and more importantly, what happens after these orders are fulfilled? It's rumored that Google, their largest customer, has already partnered with MediaTek, and their collaboration with Marvell is also continuing. In other words, Broadcom's ASIC moat is not very high, unlike Nvidia, which makes general-purpose chips. Another problem is that Broadcom warned that the gross profit margin in Q1 of fiscal year 2026 will shrink by 1% due to AI products. Although the AI ​​business is growing rapidly, the cost of investment is high. This focus on scale rather than profit has become a key concern for the market, and it also raises concerns about whether the $73 billion in orders can be delivered on time, given the significant challenges in AI chip production and supply chain management, and the high concentration of major customers, with Anthropic alone contributing $21 billion in orders. The dependence is too high. The market demands both better-than-expected growth and guaranteed profits, but Broadcom only delivered on half of that, with the other half being completely uncertain. During the conference call, it was revealed that Google will become a key customer, while Broadcom stated that it doesn't expect significant revenue from OpenAI, a key player in the AI ​​technology chain. Following the earnings report, the stock price has already fallen by over 10%. Broadcom's AI business undoubtedly has explosive potential, but the key question the market is asking is whether they have the capacity to deliver on this surge in demand. What are your thoughts?

      "selftext_processed": "AVGOs earnings report is out showing revenue of $ 18 billion a 28 % increase and net profit of $ 9.7 billion a 39 % increase . Both figures represent alltime highs with AI chips being the absolute growth engine . EPS was a high $ 1.95 a 37 % increase and the gross profit margin was 68 % . All the data significantly exceeded market expectations . However the stock price performance was interesting rising initially and then falling . It dropped 5 % after hours yesterday . The reason is simple the strong earnings report had already been priced into the market . AVGOs stock has already risen 80 % this year so todays earnings report was a buy the rumor sell the news situation . While theres a logic of buying expectations that logic isnt working here . In other words the future performance guidance is weak . Specifically Broadcom currently has $ 73 billion in backlogged orders to be delivered over the next six quarters . The companys top five customers are Google Anthropic Meta Microsoft and OpenAI . Anthropic accounts for $ 21 billion of the unfulfilled orders while OpenAI only accounts for $ 1 billion . The remaining orders approximately $ 51 billion come from Google and other major customers averaging only $ 8.5 billion per quarter . However the companys guidance for the next quarter is already $ 8.2 billion meaning there will be almost no_growth in the next five quarters . The market will certainly think that the next five quarters will be mediocre and more importantly what happens after these orders are fulfilled Its rumored that Google their largest customer has already partnered with MediaTek and their collaboration with Marvell is also continuing . In other words Broadcoms ASIC moat is not_very high unlike Nvidia which makes generalpurpose chips . Another problem is that Broadcom warned that the gross profit margin in Q1 of fiscal year 2026 will shrink by 1 % due to AI products . Although the AI ​​business is growing rapidly the cost of investment is high . This focus on scale rather than profit has become a key concern for the market and it also raises concerns about whether the $ 73 billion in orders can be delivered on time given the significant challenges in AI chip production and supply chain management and the high concentration of major customers with Anthropic alone contributing $ 21 billion in orders . The dependence is too high . The market demands both betterthanexpected growth and guaranteed profits but Broadcom only delivered on half of that with the other half being completely uncertain . During the conference call it was revealed that Google will become a key customer while Broadcom stated that it doesnt expect significant revenue from OpenAI a key player in the AI ​​technology chain . Following the earnings report the stock price has already fallen by over 10 % . Broadcoms AI business undoubtedly has explosive potential but the key question the market is asking is whether they have the capacity to deliver on this surge in demand . What are your thoughts Discuss in the comments section ."

Beauty has emerged as one of the strongest performers in the consumer beauty space, combining **brand momentum, pricing power, and margin expansion** in an otherwise competitive category. Unlike many consumer growth companies, ELF is delivering **both revenue growth and profitability**. **Business Strengths** * **Consistent revenue growth** across multiple quarters, driven by strong consumer demand * **Affordable pricing strategy** resonates in inflationary environments * **Expanding gross margins**, reflecting improved scale and operating leverage * **Effective digital and influencer marketing**, particularly with younger demographics * **Shelf space expansion** at major retailers (Target, Walmart, Ulta) ELF has positioned itself between premium branding and mass affordability, which has supported continued share gains. **Financial Performance (High Level)** * Revenue growth has remained strong year-over-year * Operating margins continue to improve * Profitability achieved while still reinvesting in growth This combination is relatively rare among consumer discretionary brands. **Risks to Monitor** * **Valuation sensitivity** if growth slows * Competitive pressure from larger beauty brands * Consumer spending slowdown impacting discretionary categories **Summary** ELF represents a consumer brand executing well operationally, with strong demand, expanding margins, and continued retail penetration. While valuation should be monitored, the company’s fundamentals remain solid relative to peers. *Not financial advice. Do your own research.*",

      "selftext": "Rivian grabbed attention this week after hosting its first Autonomy and AI Day in Palo Alto. The company outlined an aggressive push into in-house tech: a custom chip, a redesigned software stack, new autonomy features, and even an AI assistant planned for future vehicles. Analysts liked the vision especially Rivian’s attempt to reduce reliance on third-party suppliers and control more of its hardware and software pipeline. But they also pointed to the same issues that have dogged the company all year: demand is still uneven, the path to profitability is long, and Rivian will need far more capital to fund both autonomy development and its next-generation vehicles.The broader takeaway from Wall Street is that Rivian’s technology roadmap looks promising, but real execution pressure is building. AI features may help differentiate the brand, but they don’t solve the company’s core challenges involving sales, cash burn, and production scale. For now, Rivian’s message is clear it wants to be seen not just as an EV maker but as a full-stack tech company. Whether the market rewards that ambition in 2026 is still an open question. Sourve:",

      "selftext": "Global capital is already beginning to shift the US cut interest rates as expected by 25 basis points so one shoe has already dropped now we wait for the other one and the other shoe is Japan According to the information released so far next week around the 18th to 19th the Bank of Japan will very likely announce a rate hike after 30 years they may finally raise rates above 0 point 5 percent to around 0 point 75 once Japan raises rates global capital flows will start to change and global assets will go through a new round of reallocation Why is that Japan has kept ultra low interest rates for decades so investors borrowed yen and moved the money into higher yielding US assets to earn the spread the yen carry trade at its peak reached around 5 trillion dollars but now the two countries are moving in opposite directions one cutting rates one raising them so the interest rate spread will quickly shrink or even disappear to avoid losses carry traders will rush to unwind selling US stocks US bonds and other dollar assets converting to yen and sending funds back to Japan We cannot predict long term trends but in the short term exchange rates will definitely swing sharply the dollar will weaken the yen will continue to strengthen and the US will almost certainly keep cutting rates next year according to their own statements current rates are still at the upper end of the neutral range meaning still a bit too high and very likely to be cut again in Q1 next year Morgan Stanley even predicts that by Q1 of 2026 USD JPY could fall to 140 a big move from the current level above 150 these currency swings will directly affect exports a weaker dollar boosts the competitiveness of US goods while a stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive increasing pressure on Japan’s export sector History may sound familiar in the 1980s this is how the US weakened Japans once dominant Made in Japan manufacturing of course that is a bit of a joke but the next asset likely to be hit hard is US Treasuries foreign investors hold about 35 percent of all outstanding Treasuries if carry trade funds exit the US there will be large scale selling prices will fall yields will rise and since Treasuries are the anchor of global asset pricing higher yields mean global risk free benchmark rates will rise pushing financing and debt issuance costs higher around the world Capital always seeks opportunity if it cannot earn carry here it will look elsewhere so investors will search for new safe haven or arbitrage opportunities leading to another round of major global asset reallocation That is the situation if you currently hold US dollars US Treasuries or yen denominated assets you can adjust accordingly but remember to hedge your risks and allocate in stages",

      "selftext": "Jerome Powell, the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has overseen a de facto restart of quantitative easing (QE) through the implementation of \"Reserve Management Purchases\" (RMPs) as of December 12, 2025. While the Fed has officially ceased quantitative tightening (QT) and avoids the term \"QE,\" these purchases of short-term Treasury bills have the effect of expanding the balance sheet and injecting liquidity into the financial system to address recent market strains. How QE Benefits Stocks: Lower Interest Rates: The central bank buys government bonds, increasing demand and pushing yields down; this makes fixed-income investments less attractive compared to stocks. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors sell their bonds to the central bank and reinvest that money into stocks, increasing demand and prices. Economic Stimulus: QE aims to stimulate growth, leading companies to expand, borrow more cheaply, and potentially increase profits, which boosts stock valuations. Increased Liquidity: More money in the financial system encourages risk-taking, driving capital into equity markets.",

      "selftext": "The U.S. stock market is heading into 2026 with one major red flag: concentration. The “Magnificent 7” now make up 35–40% of the entire S&P 500, an unusually heavy weight for such a small group of companies. That level of dominance means broader index performance is being driven by just a handful of names, increasing downside risk if any of them stumble. Nick Ruder, CIO at Kathmere Capital, says that investors who want to stay in U.S. equities may need to rethink their approach. He points to equal-weight S&P 500 ETFs as an easy way to diversify exposure instead of letting mega-caps dictate portfolio direction. Ruder also emphasized something many investors overlooked this year: value investing. While most attention stayed glued to big tech, a number of strong value opportunities especially overseas delivered sizeable returns that many U.S.-focused investors completely missed. Heading into 2026, the takeaway seems pretty clear: concentration risk is high, and spreading out exposure may matter more than ever. Source:",

      "selftext_processed": "The U.S. stock market is heading into 2026 with one major red flag concentration . The “ Magnificent 7 ” now make up 35–40 % of the entire SP 500 an unusually heavy weight for such a small group of companies . That level of dominance means broader index performance is being driven by just a handful of names increasing downside risk if any of them stumble . Nick Ruder CIO at Kathmere Capital says that investors who want to stay in U.S. equities may need to rethink their approach . He points to equalweight SP 500 ETFs as an easy way to diversify exposure instead of letting megacaps dictate portfolio direction . Ruder also emphasized something many investors overlooked this year value investing . While most attention stayed glued to big tech a number of strong value opportunities especially overseas delivered sizeable returns that many U.S.focused investors completely missed . Heading into 2026 the takeaway seems pretty clear concentration risk is high and spreading out exposure may matter more than ever . Source"

      "selftext": "Following Oracle's revenue miss and sharp decline, Broadcomm Technologies previously a strong chip leader failed to lift its stock despite positive earnings, projected next quarter revenue doubling to $19.1 billion, and a dividend increase. Shares fell 5% in premarket trading. The company's disclosure of $73 billion in unfulfilled orders over the next six quarters sparked market concerns. As year end approaches, sector rotation accelerates, with AI concepts and tech stocks under pressure while value and cyclical stocks attract sustained capital inflows. Banks continue hitting new highs, emerging as the most stable and robust sector. Credit card stocks V/MA/AXP saw rating upgrades and rebounded sharply yesterday. Previously weak chemicals staged an oversold rebound, while retail stocks began catching up. Metals like copper, aluminum, lithium, gold, and silver rose in succession, with some industrial leaders also performing well. The Dow and small cap indices hit new all time highs. The S&P approached previous highs pre market, while the Nasdaq lagged behind. SPY will test resistance at the previous historical high of $690-$691 upon opening. A swift breakout above this level could signal further gains. If it falls below $687 within the first half hour, bears will gain the upper hand, prolonging the recent two week range bound pattern. $682 becomes the key support level for a potential downside test. Today's focus remains on whether yesterday's oversold tech leaders can sustain their rebounds. Key stocks like MSFT, ORCL, META, NVDA, and AMD must swiftly reclaim critical mid term resistance levels; failure to do so signals ongoing medium to long term corrections. Yesterday's sharp gains in credit card and chemical sector leaders appear unsustainable in the short term, making them key observation targets today. This represents my personal view and strategy for reference only.",

Shares fell 5 % in premarket trading . The companys disclosure of $ 73 billion in unfulfilled orders over the next six quarters sparked market concerns . As year end approaches sector rotation accelerates with AI concepts and tech stocks under pressure while value and cyclical stocks attract sustained capital inflows . Banks continue hitting new highs emerging as the most stable and robust sector . Credit card stocks VMAAXP saw rating upgrades and rebounded sharply yesterday . Previously weak chemicals staged an oversold rebound while retail stocks began catching up . Metals like copper aluminum lithium gold and silver rose in succession with some industrial leaders also performing well . The Dow and small cap indices hit new all time highs . The SP approached previous highs pre market while the Nasdaq lagged behind . SPY will test resistance at the previous historical high of $ 690 $ 691 upon opening . A swift breakout above this level could signal further gains . If it falls below $ 687 within the first half hour bears will gain the upper hand prolonging the recent two week range bound pattern . $ 682 becomes the key support level for a potential downside test . Todays focus remains on whether yesterdays oversold tech leaders can sustain their rebounds . Key stocks like MSFT ORCL META NVDA and AMD must swiftly reclaim critical mid term resistance levels failure to do so signals ongoing medium to long term corrections . Yesterdays sharp gains in credit card and chemical sector leaders appear unsustainable in the short term making them key observation targets today . This represents my personal view and strategy for reference only ."

      "selftext": "Over the last few months everyone’s been calling the markets “dead,” “boring,” or “completely drained of retail,” but some of the numbers coming out of the UAE region tell a very different story. According to [new data from Capital.com]( MENA traders generated over $804B in trading volume in just the first half of 2025, and about $576B of that came from the UAE alone. UAE, by itself, out-traded entire major regions. Europe, for comparison, came in at around $224B over the same period. What I found even more interesting is that the trader base in this region is very young and educated (64% have a university degree). They also show a much higher concentration of big-deposit clients. The number of traders who have put in over $1M is 10x higher than Capital.com’s European cohort. So while everyone is screaming “retail is gone,” this part of the world seems to be doing the exact opposite… It is worth noting that not all of this volume is coming from digital assets but the numbers are still very high. Just wanted to share some interesting and optimistic data points. I was personally surprised that the UAE is doing so much volume and that it is so into digital assets. Seems like the next wave of liquidity in crypto is going to come from an unexpected place, at least for me. Thoughts?",

The first company I am looking at is Olin Corporation. For the first time ever I am asking reddit about companies they know of for suggestions. My plan will be to take suggestions and then do my homework and then call a clairvoyant to approve my choices /s. I am specifically looking for small arms manufacturers. Following the Ukraine/Russia conflict it seems to me that the big weapons, tanks, jets and such are not as used as small cheaper arms. I couldn't find an ETF that focuses on smaller arms manufacturers. I feel like best case scenario in this world is countries stock pile a lot of smaller cheaper weapons. Worst case scenario is they use them.",

The first company I am looking at is Olin Corporation . For the first time ever I am asking reddit about companies they know of for suggestions . My plan will be to take suggestions and then do my homework and then call a clairvoyant to approve my choices s. I am specifically looking for small arms manufacturers . Following the UkraineRussia conflict it seems to me that the big weapons tanks jets and such are not_as used as small cheaper arms . I couldnt find an ETF that focuses on smaller arms manufacturers . I feel like best case scenario in this world is countries stock pile a lot of smaller cheaper weapons . Worst case scenario is they use them ."

The move isn’t isolated either several AI-linked names like Nvidia, Micron and CoreWeave also extended their declines, suggesting some broader cooling toward the sector. Investors seem to be stepping back a bit from the high-growth tech trade, at least temporarily, as questions around AI spending, enterprise demand and the sustainability of recent valuations continue to surface. Oracle’s weaker-than-expected cloud numbers added another layer of uncertainty, and the market appears to be digesting that slowly rather than reacting in one sharp move. Nothing dramatic in today’s price action, but it does feel like part of a larger pause across AI and infrastructure names after months of nonstop optimism. Source:",

He was one of the three members who voted against the quarter-point cut, and his reasoning essentially comes down to timing. In his view, the committee should have waited rather than moving ahead with another reduction. Goolsbee pointed out that he’s still optimistic about the broader trajectory particularly heading into 2026, where he believes rates can be “a fair bit lower” than they are now. But despite that longer-term confidence, he felt the current environment didn’t justify an immediate cut, especially while the Fed is still trying to balance easing financial conditions with keeping inflation on a durable path downward. His comments don’t necessarily change the broader outlook, but they do show how divided the committee has become.

      "selftext": "Apple has felt “boring” for a while, but the setup going into 2026 is quietly getting a lot more interesting. Revenue is ticking back up, margins are improving, and earnings are growing much faster than most people realize. Nearly 20% YoY net-income growth for a company this size is no small thing. The services side is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. As Apple shifts more toward software and recurring revenue, the business becomes steadier and less reliant on big hardware cycles. That’s showing up in the fundamentals. And on the AI front: no, Apple isn’t trying to compete with Nvidia. Nvidia remains the king of AI for the foreseeable future. Apple’s edge is seamless integration, bringing on-device AI to its ecosystem in a way that just works. If the 2025 lineup delivers, 2026 could be the year it actually shows up in the numbers. It’s not a cheap stock, but for the first time in a while, the growth story looks healthier than the sentiment around it. 2026 might be the year Apple quietly surprises again not with a new phone, but with fundamentals lining up.",

      "title": "Panic Selling Psychology?",
      "selftext": "What do you think is more common - people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just can't intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed, overleveraged, nearing retirement, i.e. have actual *reasoning* for needing the money? I understand the latter, that part makes sense to me. You may very well *need* this money and are not willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle (i.e. push the retirement goalposts) to accommodate the current situation. Understood. But if you're not in that latter bucket, let's assume you don't *need* the money that you're pulling out of the market. No upcoming large purchases, no retirement on the near horizon, etc. So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate? Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now \"safe\" from further paper losses, even though they just guaranteed losses by selling? This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting - without logical/just reasoning for actually *needing* the money (highly subjective of course) is it not just 100% human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale? I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as \"what if this time it's different?\" and \"what if we enter a 15-year recession?\" Are the people who panic sell not proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts? I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L. Collins. I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is. It seems like 95% of it is man vs. himself. It's truly fascinating. Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their 'investing mind' who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash, and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically.",

      "selftext_processed": "What do you think is more common people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just cant intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed overleveraged nearing retirement i.e . have actual reasoning for needing the money I understand the latter that part makes sense to me . You may very well need this money and are not_willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle i.e . push the retirement goalposts to accommodate the current situation . Understood . But if youre not_in that latter bucket lets assume you dont need the money that youre pulling out of the market . No_upcoming large purchases no_retirement on the near horizon etc . So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now safe from further paper losses even though they just guaranteed losses by selling This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting without logicaljust reasoning for actually needing the money highly subjective of course is it not_just 100 % human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as what if this time its different and what if we enter a 15year recession Are the people who panic sell not_proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L . Collins . I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is . It seems like 95 % of it is man vs. himself . Its truly fascinating . Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their investing mind who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically ."

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic . FINVIZ for fundamental data charts and aggregated news Earnings Whisper for earnings details See our past daily discussions here .

      "selftext": "I believe rare earth metals will at some point be in heated discussion again. This will be a negative catalyst, which will cause market downturn except for companies like LAC, MP, USAR. Some of the few companies which offset or hedge against: * export restriction talks * geopolitical tension regarding minerals * tariff escalation fighting for minerals * supply-chain “reshoring” There's really only few things which can rock this market, for example AI earnings start to come in bad, or the countries fighting for AI domination will begin to attack the resources used to power these machines. There's fundamental drift as well as LAC inches closer to opening in 2027. This is a long term investment with shares, the price action reached $10 before when this tension brewed, which imo will rebound as this tension comes back in some form in 2026. This gives a hedge opportunity and long term investment into commodities, or what will be North America's biggest lithium mine.",

      "title": "KRMN: The Pick-and-Shovel Space Play",
      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase, if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit, then KRMN is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= What fueled **KRMN's 189% run** since its IPO on February 13? # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum, and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit (*get it?*) # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that **positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond**. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and **national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( []( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day. ================================= Shares, cost basis $58.99 And a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** (these are cheap risk, high reward, though!) because they were dirt cheap, and I know KRMN can move $7-10 in two or three days. However, the play is long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit then KRMN is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . What fueled KRMNs 189 % run since its IPO on February 13 The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit get it 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day . Shares cost basis $ 58.99 And a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls these are cheap risk high reward though because they were dirt cheap and I know KRMN can move $ 710 in two or three days . However the play is longterm ."

      "selftext": "This probably somewhat of a hot take, and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off, but I've been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples... I understand that different investors have different goals, time horizons, risk appetites, but still. Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times, no matter what the economy is doing. We've been told that these stocks have steady demand, predictable revenue, and the cherry on top is the big dividend. Now it doesn't really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds. Consumers are tightening up on spending, there's tons of competition, and inflation is killing them. Input costs keep rising, prices keep going up for the consumer, and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices. When that happens, you either have to cut price or have your margins cut. Either way, not great for the stock or the business... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks: \\- $CL down 14.69% YTD \\- $PG down 15.19% YTD \\- $KVUE down 18.61% YTD \\- $KMB down 20.81% YTD \\- $CLX down 36.46% YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows, and even with the higher dividend yields, I’m struggling to see where the “protection” is supposed to come from. Most people holding these stocks probably aren’t expecting a ton of growth, but if you’re not buying them for growth, what are you buying them for? Maybe you own it for the dividend, but then what do you do in a year like this? At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing? If you're really looking for protection, or a hedge, why not just own gold? It's something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment. Maybe this all sounds \"toppy\" for me to say with the S&P close to all time highs. Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely, be a contrarian, buy these stocks, and wait for the rebound. However, I just don't really see the point right now. Please take all of this with a grain of salt as I'm in my late 20's and could be completely wrong.",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably somewhat of a hot take and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off but Ive been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples ... I understand that different investors have different goals time horizons risk appetites but still . Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times no_matter what the economy is doing . Weve been told that these stocks have steady demand predictable revenue and the cherry on top is the big dividend . Now it doesnt really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds . Consumers are tightening up on spending theres tons of competition and inflation is killing them . Input costs keep rising prices keep going up for the consumer and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices . When that happens you either have to cut price or have your margins cut . Either way not_great for the stock or the business ... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks $ CL down 14.69 % YTD $ PG down 15.19 % YTD $ KVUE down 18.61 % YTD $ KMB down 20.81 % YTD $ CLX down 36.46 % YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows and even with the higher dividend yields I ’ m struggling to see where the “ protection ” is supposed to come from . Most people holding these stocks probably aren ’ t expecting a ton of growth but if you ’ re not_buying them for growth what are you buying them for Maybe you own it for the dividend but then what do you do in a year like this At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing If youre really looking for protection or a hedge why not_just own gold Its something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment . Maybe this all sounds toppy for me to say with the SP close to all time highs . Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely be a contrarian buy these stocks and wait for the rebound . However I just dont really see the point right now . Please take all of this with a grain of salt as Im in my late 20s and could be completely wrong ."

Looking at the performance of the top holdings, it doesn’t seem that any of then had THAT bad of a day; some losers, but nothing huge from what I could see. Same with GSPK to a lesser extent; down 5% on the day while the general indexes didn’t get walloped that badly ( maybe Oracle contributed, but it’s not a top ten holding). What am I missing here? Not looking for critiques of the funds themselves right now, but wondering how one can go down 30% in a day while the stocks themselves didnt shit the bed all that bad. TIA",

Looking at the performance of the top holdings it doesn ’ t seem that any of then had THAT bad of a day some losers but nothing_huge from what I could see . Same with GSPK to a lesser extent down 5 % on the day while the general indexes didn ’ t get walloped that badly maybe Oracle contributed but it ’ s not_a top ten holding . What am I missing here Not_looking for critiques of the funds themselves right now but wondering how one can go down 30 % in a day while the stocks themselves didnt shit the bed all that bad . TIA"

The bottom line is money, and the momentum of the USA economy is less discretionary money for an expanding portion of consumers. Who will buy those sweet red roses? \"Business is flush with cash,\" you say? How long? Robots? Competition has caused robots to drop in price. One million robots sold for $1000 is $1 billion. Not $1 trillion. It would take over four billion robots sold at $1000 to equal NVDA market cap. Chips are a component of that $1000. \"NVidia valuation if for data centers,\" you say? To serve who? Businesses selling ads? To who? The 1%? Do you see the math problem? So, let's consider two challenges coming. 1. AI bubble bursts. I have NVDA and INTC as short targets. 2. Japan carry trade unwind. I have TM as a safety hedge. So, my plan is to use gains from price declines in NVDA and INTC using put options to buy call options and shares in TM. The further upside is that TM has growth potential in its core business and as a Japan company it has stock price growth potential from a hyperinflated dollar. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "\\>The order would create one federal regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \\>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry, a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology. \\>Mr. Trump, who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I., has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations. He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws, and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology. \\>“It’s got to be one source,” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office. “You can’t go to 50 different sources.” \\>The president has increasingly embraced the A.I. industry, signing executive orders to limit regulation, provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology. He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I., including this week, and publicly praised the companies’ leaders. And he has given David Sacks, his A.I. and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor, heavy influence over policy decisions. \\> The order on Thursday, which has sparked broad, bipartisan opposition, is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws, legal experts said. \\>If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws, he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I. regulations, said Wes Hodges, the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. \\>“Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carve-out for Big Tech,” Mr. Hodges said. \\>New generative A.I. technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off. But the technology can be misused to trick consumers, and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors, among other issues. \\> States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I. safety, requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used. This year, all 50 states and territories introduced A.I. legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I. models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, to test for safety and to disclose the results. South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes, which are realistic A.I.-generated videos, in political advertisements within months of an election. Utah, Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I. chatbots and mental health, requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection. \\>States have also passed a growing number of child-safety regulations targeting A.I. chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.-based technologies. \\>“Blocking state laws regulating A.I. is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online,” said Sarah Gardner, the chief executive of Heat Initiative, a child safety group. “States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I. harms.” \\> A.I. companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations. Earlier this year, some lawmakers attempted to include a decade-long moratorium on state A.I. laws in the domestic policy bill, but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition. \\>“A 50-state patchwork is a startup killer,” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month.",

      "selftext_processed": "The order would create one federal regulatory framework for artificial intelligence Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office . President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology . Mr. Trump who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I . has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations . He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology . “ It ’ s got to be one source ” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office . “ You can ’ t go to 50 different sources. ” The president has increasingly embraced the A.I . industry signing executive orders to limit regulation provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology . He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I . including this week and publicly praised the companies ’ leaders . And he has given David Sacks his A.I . and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor heavy influence over policy decisions . The order on Thursday which has sparked broad bipartisan opposition is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws legal experts said . If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I . regulations said Wes Hodges the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the rightleaning Heritage Foundation . “ Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carveout for Big Tech ” Mr. Hodges said . New generative A.I . technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off . But the technology can be misused to trick consumers and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors among other issues . States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I . safety requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used . This year all 50 states and territories introduced A.I . legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I . models including OpenAI ’ s ChatGPT and Google ’ s Gemini to test for safety and to disclose the results . South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes which are realistic A.I.generated videos in political advertisements within months of an election . Utah Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I . chatbots and mental health requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection . States have also passed a growing number of childsafety regulations targeting A.I . chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.based technologies . “ Blocking state laws regulating A.I . is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online ” said Sarah Gardner the chief executive of Heat Initiative a child safety group . “ States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I . harms. ” A.I . companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations . Earlier this year some lawmakers attempted to include a decadelong moratorium on state A.I . laws in the domestic policy bill but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition . “ A 50state patchwork is a startup killer ” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month ."

      "selftext": "Oracle basically signed up for something close to a $300 billion long term commitment to support OpenAI’s infrastructure. Most of that is data centers and compute, and the spending comes early while the payoff is way out in the future. That’s why the stock reaction looks rough. This isn’t about doubting AI. It’s about margins getting squeezed and the balance sheet taking the hit before revenue catches up. This kind of buildout is capital heavy, not classic high margin software. Oracle is also going head to head with hyperscalers that already run at massive scale. That raises execution risk. The whole thing only works if OpenAI demand stays strong for years, not quarters. If AI spending cools off at all, Oracle feels it fast because the capex isn’t flexible.",

It ’ s about margins getting squeezed and the balance sheet taking the hit before revenue catches up . This kind of buildout is capital heavy not_classic high margin software . Oracle is also going head to head with hyperscalers that already run at massive scale . That raises execution risk . The whole thing only works if OpenAI demand stays strong for years not_quarters .

      "selftext": "Howdy! At the beginning of my investing career, so small mistakes are expected here and there. The situation: I bought SCHD since I heard it was a good dividend option; the problem is, I didn't buy it in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401K or Roth IRA) and instead bought it in a regular brokerage account. Not the end of the world since it only has about $1K USD dedicated to it, but I heard essentially you just end up paying a lot of taxes on it. I also heard that you really want to try to hold on to stocks for at least a year to avoid higher tax rates, but would it be fine to sell off + tank the short-term cost + reinvest in a better stock of my choice? Appreciate your thoughts!",

      "selftext": "NFLX currently (94 something) is at about 28% lower than its ATH (133$). There is also the hope tthat the Warner Bros deal goes ahead as expected. In the past, I have been burnt by Reddit adage about \"failing stock, nobody uses it\" which had been proclaimed for Meta etc but everyone and their mom is addicted to instagram reels, facebook posts etc. (except for the self proclaimed Reddit intellectual elite of course). I missed the rally from 2021 onwards when Meta and other were at all time low. It seems like a very simple equation. **The more a brand people like and use frequently or obsessively, the more there is the possibility of it being higher priced in future**. I have seen this movie again and again since a decade. * AAPL - Apple stores are still full of folks and it just keeps on climbing despite no improvements in AI. People love it no matter what. * GOOG - Everyone is hooked on youtube and everyone has discovered their favorite subgenre/niche. The average watchtime on youtube keeps on increasing while networks and other formats suffer. Furthermore, the Gemini success with tensor chips will make Google most likely the AI leader * MSFT - This is a curious case. The majority of consumers use and like it because it is available at multi price points. But Corporations overwhelmingly dont have any other choice except to integrate the whole windows ecosystem including docs, teams etc. The common folks don't have any idea how integral windows and its services is to like maybe 90% of companies. * AMZN - Keeps on breaking records every year with Amazon retail and AWS also keeps growing. It has been said time and again that while GCP and Azure are playing catch up, it is simply not possible for many companies to just replace their years old AWS stack with other alternatives. AWS is here to stay and grow (although maybe not at the pace as earlier) * NFLX - With hopefully the WB catalog, this seems poised to be dominating households for a long long time. There is something there for everyone and anecdotal but yes I don't know a single friend or acquaintance who doesn't subscribe to Netflix. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext_processed": "NFLX currently 94 something is at about 28 % lower than its ATH 133 $ . There is also the hope tthat the Warner Bros deal goes ahead as expected . In the past I have been burnt by Reddit adage about failing stock nobody_uses it which had been proclaimed for Meta etc but everyone and their mom is addicted to instagram reels facebook posts etc . except for the self proclaimed Reddit intellectual elite of course . I missed the rally from 2021 onwards when Meta and other were at all time low . It seems like a very simple equation . The more a brand people like and use frequently or obsessively the more there is the possibility of it being higher priced in future . I have seen this movie again and again since a decade . AAPL Apple stores are still full of folks and it just keeps on climbing despite no_improvements in AI . People love it no_matter what . GOOG Everyone is hooked on youtube and everyone has discovered their favorite subgenreniche . The average watchtime on youtube keeps on increasing while networks and other formats suffer . Furthermore the Gemini success with tensor chips will make Google most likely the AI leader MSFT This is a curious case . The majority of consumers use and like it because it is available at multi price points . But Corporations overwhelmingly dont have any other choice except to integrate the whole windows ecosystem including docs teams etc . The common folks dont have any idea how integral windows and its services is to like maybe 90 % of companies . AMZN Keeps on breaking records every year with Amazon retail and AWS also keeps growing . It has been said time and again that while GCP and Azure are playing catch up it is simply not_possible for many companies to just replace their years old AWS stack with other alternatives . AWS is here to stay and grow although maybe not_at the pace as earlier NFLX With hopefully the WB catalog this seems poised to be dominating households for a long long time . There is something there for everyone and anecdotal but yes I dont know a single friend or acquaintance who doesnt subscribe to Netflix . What do you guys think"

      "selftext": "Costco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street’s quarterly expectations as its sales rose 8.2% year over year. The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. The company is expected to share more details about the quarter during an earnings call, which starts at 5 p.m. ET. Here’s how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expected Revenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expected Costco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers’ renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed. In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco’s net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Source:",

      "selftext": "The Fed's interest rate cut was expected, and Oracle's ORCL earnings report dragged down US AI and major tech stocks. ORCL's continued high debt, persistently negative free cash flow, and ever-increasing costs turned what was actually a good earnings report into a negative, causing a sharp drop in after-hours trading yesterday and dragging down major tech stocks today. I'm not optimistic about Oracle's AI path; it will ultimately not become a partner in OpenAI. After all, with a deep-pocketed company like Microsoft at the helm, it's clearly not the best choice for OpenAI. AI is expensive, requiring even more electricity than Bitcoin and is more delicate to maintain. This relates to what I wrote yesterday about Tesla's potential energy storage, something I said I'd discuss later, but I'll address it now. Let's start by simply explaining why AI needs electricity, and a lot of it at that. AI operation mainly consists of two parts, each consuming a large amount of electricity: The first part is model training, a very energy-intensive process. For example, training GPT5 once requires a huge amount of computation, necessitating tens of thousands of GPUs/TPUs running simultaneously for weeks or months. These GPUs continuously consume electricity and generate heat, requiring cooling. The second part is model inference. Every time a user asks a question, the model parameters are read, mathematical calculations are performed, and an answer is generated, all requiring electricity. Each user dialogue may involve tens to hundreds of watts of computation. The enormous electricity consumption has caused global concerns about electricity supply in the face of AI. Since electricity is the foundation of AI, major tech companies are investing in and exploring renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal energy. I know that Google and Microsoft have invested in small nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion companies, respectively. Jensen Huang mentioned in a speech that the US may be filled with small nuclear companies in the future. So the conclusion is this: AI needs electricity, and the more powerful the AI, the more electricity it consumes. In fact, the future development speed of AI may depend on the power supply, rather than the algorithm itself. Having said all that, what more needs to be said about Tesla's energy storage? You should already understand my outlook on Tesla/Tesla energy storage; this is a subtle, understated approach. I often receive private messages asking about Tesla's prospects. If you don't understand an industry, don't invest in its stock. Of course, you might say you don't need to look at the financial statements; you can use the technical indicators (TA) for swing trading, which is another matter.",

      "selftext": "Broadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock rose 3% in extended trading on Thursday. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimated Revenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimated Broadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips, and separately, announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on-track to buy and deploy custom chips. Broadcom's overall revenue grew 28% during the quarter, which the company attributed largely to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, which would be equivalent to $8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter. AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.",

      "selftext": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something - this is in the USA. They currently have 100% equity in a rental house. Their purchase price was $132,000 plus around $65,000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental. Call it $200,000 even as their investment in this house. Rental house generates $2500/mo on average as a vacation rental. This does require some effort from him, but not a lot. Say 2-3 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests. Insurance is around $2000 a year, taxes are low. Since there's no mortgage, the only real costs are utilities (electric is very cheap) and insurance ($2000 a year). Taxes are cheap. So they are netting somewhere around $27-28,000 a year. Here's the thing we're trying to figure out: The house has appreciated greatly, from what we can tell, since they bought it 5 years back. Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $400,000's. He thinks they can get at least $400k for it, maybe more. There are already several people asking and two offers. This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50% this year on his investments. Their plan would be to take 2/3 of the money and put it in \"safe\" spots, ETF's, bonds, even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net. The other 1/3 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital. I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all. We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7%, that $400,000 would generate $28,000/yr ... is that not better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property? This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues (western USA) ... nothing yet but it feels very much in the cards. Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area. Is it a smart move to sell?",

      "selftext_processed": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something this is in the USA . They currently have 100 % equity in a rental house . Their purchase price was $ 132000 plus around $ 65000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental . Call it $ 200000 even as their investment in this house . Rental house generates $ 2500mo on average as a vacation rental . This does require some effort from him but not_a lot . Say 23 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests . Insurance is around $ 2000 a year taxes are low . Since theres no_mortgage the only real costs are utilities electric is very cheap and insurance $ 2000 a year . Taxes are cheap . So they are netting somewhere around $ 2728000 a year . Heres the thing were trying to figure out The house has appreciated greatly from what we can tell since they bought it 5 years back . Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $ 400000s . He thinks they can get at least $ 400k for it maybe more . There are already several people asking and two offers . This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50 % this year on his investments . Their plan would be to take 23 of the money and put it in safe spots ETFs bonds even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net . The other 13 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital . I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all . We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7 % that $ 400000 would generate $ 28000yr ... is that not_better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues western USA ... nothing_yet but it feels very much in the cards . Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area . Is it a smart move to sell"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 9.1% in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025, showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes. >The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37% from the previous month, while options and crypto trading fell by 28% and 12%, respectively. The number of funded customers also decreased, partly due to the removal of about 280,000 low-balance accounts. Adding to the pressure, Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a cease-and-desist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations. In response to the developments, analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock. >What Is The Market Telling Us >Robinhood’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. >The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader. >The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto. This move marked Robinhood's entry into Southeast Asia's largest market, which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders. The expansion was part of the company's broader international growth strategy throughout 2025. The deals were subject to approval by Indonesia's Financial Services Authority, with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026. Investor reaction was optimistic, seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fast-growing market for both stock and crypto trading. >Robinhood is up 215% since the beginning of the year, but at $124.09 per share, it is still trading 18.6% below its 52-week high of $152.46 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $3,564.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of financial services company Robinhood NASDAQHOOD fell 9.1 % in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025 showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes . The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37 % from the previous month while options and crypto trading fell by 28 % and 12 % respectively . The number of funded customers also decreased partly due to the removal of about 280000 lowbalance accounts . Adding to the pressure Connecticuts Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a ceaseanddesist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations . In response to the developments analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock . What Is The Market Telling Us Robinhood ’ s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5 % over the last year . In that context today ’ s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not_something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business . The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8 % on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader . The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto . This move marked Robinhoods entry into Southeast Asias largest market which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders . The expansion was part of the companys broader international growth strategy throughout 2025 . The deals were subject to approval by Indonesias Financial Services Authority with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026 . Investor reaction was optimistic seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fastgrowing market for both stock and crypto trading . Robinhood is up 215 % since the beginning of the year but at $ 124.09 per share it is still trading 18.6 % below its 52week high of $ 152.46 from October 2025 . Investors who bought $ 1000 worth of Robinhood ’ s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $ 3564 ."

      "title": "A deep dive into RKLB's backlog and burn rate: Is this stock the next SpaceX or a value trap? My in-depth valuation model.",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been following Rocket Lab (RKLB) for over two years. The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me re-evaluate the company's fundamentals. I've noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about \"To the Moon\" or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck, with few people actually sitting down to do the math. To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable, I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation model based on their latest earnings call, backlog conversion rates, and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket. I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model, hoping to spark some rational discussion: 1. Space Systems is the real moat, not the launch business. Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight, but my data shows that RKLB's Space Systems division (solar panels, reactor wheels, etc.) is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business. The market seems to see RKLB merely as a \"smaller SpaceX,\" ignoring its potential as a \"prime of space infrastructure.\" My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months, as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate, the downside potential for the stock price is locked in. 2. Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face. I simulated three scenarios: Optimistic Scenario: Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025. Neutral Scenario: Technical delays occur, requiring additional financing. Pessimistic Scenario: A collapse similar to Astra's. In my \"neutral\" model, RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $300-500 million before 2026. This implies potential equity dilution. However, if they can secure a few specific government contracts (I've listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model), this gap will disappear. 3. Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking, some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions. This is often a bottoming signal, but it could also mean a multi-year consolidation phase. Conclusion and Discussion: Based on current price fluctuations, I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient. It's either severely undervalued (if Neutron delivers on time) or overvalued (if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored). Regarding my model data: This Excel model is very large, containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts, sensitivity analysis charts, and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins. Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format. However, I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions (Bear Case). If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data; or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast; or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions; please feel free to point this out in the comments, and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth. I'm curious about everyone's views on the actual impact of Neutron's delays on cash flow. Am I being too pessimistic?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Ive been following Rocket Lab RKLB for over two years . The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me reevaluate the companys fundamentals . Ive noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about To the Moon or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck with few people actually sitting down to do the math . To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF Discounted Cash Flow valuation model based on their latest earnings call backlog conversion rates and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket . I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model hoping to spark some rational discussion 1 . Space Systems is the real moat not_the launch business . Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight but my data shows that RKLBs Space Systems division solar panels reactor wheels etc . is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business . The market seems to see RKLB merely as a smaller SpaceX ignoring its potential as a prime of space infrastructure . My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate the downside potential for the stock price is locked in . 2 . Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face . I simulated three scenarios Optimistic Scenario Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025 . Neutral Scenario Technical delays occur requiring additional financing . Pessimistic Scenario A collapse similar to Astras . In my neutral model RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $ 300500 million before 2026 . This implies potential equity dilution . However if they can secure a few specific government contracts Ive listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model this gap will disappear . 3 . Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions . This is often a bottoming signal but it could also mean a multiyear consolidation phase . Conclusion and Discussion Based on current price fluctuations I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient . Its either severely undervalued if Neutron delivers on time or overvalued if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored . Regarding my model data This Excel model is very large containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts sensitivity analysis charts and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins . Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format . However I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions Bear Case . If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions please feel free to point this out in the comments and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth . Im curious about everyones views on the actual impact of Neutrons delays on cash flow . Am I being too pessimistic"

      "selftext": "The Fed’s latest move makes it pretty clear which side of the mandate is getting more attention right now. At his press conference, Powell repeated several times that recent job growth may actually be negative once revisions come in. That’s a pretty notable shift in tone and it suggests the committee is getting increasingly worried about the labor market softening more than expected. With inflation cooling but not fully settled, the Fed is trying to walk a very narrow path. Wednesday’s rate cut was framed as part of that balancing act: easing enough to prevent further deterioration in employment, but not so much that they risk re-accelerating prices. How they manage this trade-off is likely going to define policy through 2026, especially if more data starts confirming labor weakness. The broader question now is whether the Fed thinks the economy can handle weaker job numbers without slipping into something more serious, or whether this is the first sign of a longer adjustment ahead.

      "selftext": "SpaceX’s path to a public listing got a little clearer after Elon Musk said the recent reports about a 2026 IPO are “accurate.” Several outlets had already noted that the company completed a secondary share sale valuing it near $800 billion, and the timing of that deal naturally fueled speculation about next steps. A public listing would mark a major shift for SpaceX, which has stayed private far longer than most companies of its scale. Investors have been watching closely to see when Musk might open the door to outside shareholders, but there are still plenty of questions about how a business built around long-term, capital-intensive projects will be received by the public markets. For now, nothing is formally announced, but Musk’s brief acknowledgment is the strongest signal yet that SpaceX is preparing for a transition that would reshape both the company and the broader space industry.

A public listing would mark a major shift for SpaceX which has stayed private far longer than most companies of its scale . Investors have been watching closely to see when Musk might open the door to outside shareholders but there are still plenty of questions about how a business built around longterm capitalintensive projects will be received by the public markets . For now nothing_is formally announced but Musk ’ s brief acknowledgment is the strongest signal yet that SpaceX is preparing for a transition that would reshape both the company and the broader space industry .

      "selftext": "Nvidia is seeing a wave of positive sentiment after analysts pointed out new export approvals for its H200 chips going to China. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating, while Wells Fargo flagged the significance of these approvals in maintaining Nvidia’s position in markets affected by U.S. China restrictions. Another interesting development is Nvidia’s new GPU tracking system, which appears designed to address ongoing geopolitical concerns about chip flows. It’s a reminder that Nvidia isn’t just selling hardware anymore it’s increasingly operating in a regulatory environment where transparency tools can influence policy decisions. Analysts continue to emphasize how central Nvidia chips are to China’s AI ambitions, even within tightened export rules. The market seems to recognize that despite restrictions, demand hasn’t evaporated it’s just getting reshaped. Given the volatility around chip export news lately, do you see this as a durable sentiment shift or just a short-term bounce?",

Bank of America reiterated its buy rating while Wells Fargo flagged the significance of these approvals in maintaining Nvidia ’ s position in markets affected by U.S. China restrictions . Another interesting development is Nvidia ’ s new GPU tracking system which appears designed to address ongoing geopolitical concerns about chip flows . It ’ s a reminder that Nvidia isn ’ t just selling hardware anymore it ’ s increasingly operating in a regulatory environment where transparency tools can influence policy decisions . Analysts continue to emphasize how central Nvidia chips are to China ’ s AI ambitions even within tightened export rules . The market seems to recognize that despite restrictions demand hasn ’ t evaporated it ’ s just getting reshaped . Given the volatility around chip export news lately do you see this as a durable sentiment shift or just a shortterm bounce"

      "title": "Microsoft juggling a major lawsuit and new AI investments mixed market reaction follows",
      "selftext": "Microsoft is dealing with a mix of legal pressure and expansion news this week. The company was hit with a $2.8 billion lawsuit accusing it of overcharging for cloud licenses something regulators have been raising questions about for years now. That overshadowed what should’ve been a positive update from Satya Nadella, who announced a sizable investment in India alongside deeper AI integration into Dynamics 365. Despite the broader tech sell-off, MSFT only dipped around 0.9%, which suggests investors are still placing more weight on long-term AI positioning than on the legal noise. But the lawsuit does highlight a recurring vulnerability for Microsoft: regulators and competitors regularly push back against its cloud pricing structure. The bigger strategic picture is that Microsoft continues doubling down on enterprise AI adoption, even as the regulatory environment gets tighter. Curious if anyone thinks this lawsuit meaningfully changes the cloud landscape, or if it’s just another chapter in a long-running dispute.",

      "selftext": "Tesla’s latest downgrade from Morgan Stanley brings renewed attention to something the market hasn’t talked about much lately chip supply constraints. The bank cut its rating to Equal Weight while still raising the price target to $425, which is an interesting signal: analysts don’t see TSLA collapsing, but they’re also not confident enough about near-term execution to call it undervalued. The core issue seems to be lingering uncertainty around chip availability and delivery timelines, especially as Tesla tries to scale multiple initiatives at once (FSD, energy, robotics, manufacturing revamps). Even with projected growth, analysts appear cautious about whether Tesla can maintain delivery consistency heading into 2026. It’s another reminder that Tesla’s biggest challenges aren’t always demand-related sometimes the bottlenecks sit deeper in the supply chain. Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here. Is this just typical year-end conservatism from analysts, or something more structural?",

Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here . Is this just typical yearend conservatism from analysts or something more structural"

      "selftext": "Most of you have probably seen the report/highlights. For those who did not, TLDR: revenue slightly missed estimates, capex surged, resulting in negative FCF (-$10 billion). ORCL is -12.5% as I write these words, SP500 is flat. I wonder when the market starts paying attention to the AI capex problem (or is it a real problem at all?). It's a big question given the market's dependence on Mag7 and the AI story in general. At the same time, Fed has already decided to start buying shorter-term Treasury securities and is probably just one step away from a full QE. I wonder if QE makes investors forget about anything else so that the market can tolerate a few quarters of so-so reports (due to surging capex) from tech and keep testing new highs.",

My question is, does vested only mean that the money is guaranteed to be mine (for whatever is earned of course) or does it have to be deposited into the account? Myself and any co-workers lose the opportunity for that money to grow for possibly almost a 16-17 months?",

      "selftext": "Over the past few months there’ve been some “let LLMs trade stocks” experiments. One thing that stood out to me: DeepSeek often ends up near the top, and people usually explain it as, *“well, the team has a quant trading background.”* What I found more interesting is how DeepSeek behaves when you look at its decisions over time: * **It doesn’t panic in broad selloffs.** When the whole market goes red, it doesn’t immediately dump everything. It often holds through the drop instead of selling right into the lows, so it’s still holding when prices recover. * **It leans toward stronger fundamentals rather than pure hype.** Over multiple episodes it tends to favor companies with more solid business profiles, instead of chasing whatever is moving the most that day. * **It adds gradually when “good” names get cheaper.** On sharp down days, it sometimes scales in slowly to higher‑quality names at lower prices, rather than joining the exit. Put together, the pattern looks less like an AI chasing volatility and more like a cautious, valuation‑aware portfolio manager with a fairly consistent way of handling risk.",

One thing that stood out to me DeepSeek often ends up near the top and people usually explain it as “ well the team has a quant trading background. ” What I found more interesting is how DeepSeek behaves when you look at its decisions over time It doesn ’ t panic in broad selloffs . When the whole market goes red it doesn ’ t immediately dump everything . It often holds through the drop instead of selling right into the lows so it ’ s still holding when prices recover . It leans toward stronger fundamentals rather than pure hype . Over multiple episodes it tends to favor companies with more solid business profiles instead of chasing whatever is moving the most that day . It adds gradually when “ good ” names get cheaper . On sharp down days it sometimes scales in slowly to higher‑quality names at lower prices rather than joining the exit . Put together the pattern looks less like an AI chasing volatility and more like a cautious valuation‑aware portfolio manager with a fairly consistent way of handling risk ."

      "selftext": "I am a really confused about what ADR investing in China based stocks from within the US really is. My understanding is that a third party company opens an offshore account in a place like the Caymen Islands. So the investor is basically investing in the Caymen Islands partner who owns shares in the Chinese business. They then agree to share a portion of the shares or profits with the investors based on the amount invested. That is what I thought it was but then I see articles saying that the partner owns no shares and agrees to share profits. So isn't that the same thing a share of the profits based on shares of Chinese stocks sold? What is to prevent this third party partner in the Caymen Islands from keeping the profits for themselves, making up fake statements for clients or going bankrupt? Where is the protection? Who would an investor complain to?",

My understanding is that a third party company opens an offshore account in a place like the Caymen Islands . So the investor is basically investing in the Caymen Islands partner who owns shares in the Chinese business . They then agree to share a portion of the shares or profits with the investors based on the amount invested . That is what I thought it was but then I see articles saying that the partner owns no_shares and agrees to share profits . So isnt that the same thing a share of the profits based on shares of Chinese stocks sold What is to prevent this third party partner in the Caymen Islands from keeping the profits for themselves making up fake statements for clients or going bankrupt Where is the protection Who would an investor complain to"

      "selftext": "Are we already living through another industrial-scale labor shift, or are the fears around AI way ahead of reality? That’s the debate resurfacing after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that AI is “not a big part of the story” in the labor market right now even if it’s probably starting to play a role around the edges. Powell’s comments clash with what a lot of workers are feeling. Executives across tech, finance, media, and even manufacturing have been unusually open about how they expect AI to reshape job structures, cut headcount, or automate entire workflows. That messaging alone has created a sense of uncertainty, even if the actual economic data hasn’t yet shown large-scale displacement. Right now, most of the labor market slowdown seems tied to broader macro pressures cautious companies, weaker demand, and delayed hiring not directly to AI. But the fear that the next wave of automation could arrive faster than previous cycles is still very real for a lot of people. Curious where everyone here stands: Do you think Powell is right and AI’s impact is still small? Or are we underestimating how quickly AI is starting to reshape work behind the scenes? Source: [",

      "selftext": "On the spam midfield that is yahoo finance news feed I noticed yesterday that the majority on analysts see MSTR as a buy or strong buy and one of the price targets was over 700 dollars a share. To me it seems like a house of cards for several reasons. 1.) If bitcoin drops lower than their cost basis all they have done is spend billions on a bad asset. Like a REIT buying an apartment complex and finding it's all covered in black mold. 2.) Saylor is trying so hard to appear fearless it should be scaring people. If his playbook is to keep issuing new shares and diluting to buy more bitcoin as the price collapses he needs a new playbook. 3.) IMO the potential downward spiral of a company is much faster if the only product the company has is its share price. And if the driver for that share price is a super volatile asset that's on a huge losing streak. 4.) The preferred stock with absurd dividends seems like an overconfident bet vs. a sustainable business strategy. (pun intended) If the bull case is bitcoin ONLY goes up over the long term I can understand that. But crypto is not the S and P or gold and it's history is short enough I couldn't sleep at night if that was my only reason for holding MSTR. I'm am legitimately curious what I'm missing. This post is my effort to learn new things. I don't have any money on either side of this stock and honestly both sides scare me.",

To me it seems like a house of cards for several reasons . 1 . If bitcoin drops lower than their cost basis all they have done is spend billions on a bad asset . Like a REIT buying an apartment complex and finding its all covered in black mold . 2 . Saylor is trying so hard to appear fearless it should be scaring people . If his playbook is to keep issuing new shares and diluting to buy more bitcoin as the price collapses he needs a new playbook . 3 . IMO the potential downward spiral of a company is much faster if the only product the company has is its share price . And if the driver for that share price is a super volatile asset thats on a huge losing streak . 4 . The preferred stock with absurd dividends seems like an overconfident bet vs. a sustainable business strategy . pun intended If the bull case is bitcoin ONLY goes up over the long term I can understand that . But crypto is not_the S and P or gold and its history is short enough I couldnt sleep at night if that was my only reason for holding MSTR . Im am legitimately curious what Im missing . This post is my effort to learn new things . I dont have any money on either side of this stock and honestly both sides scare me ."

As part of the deal, Sora and ChatGPT Image users will be able to generate content featuring Disney’s copyrighted characters, including big names like Mickey Mouse, Ariel, Cinderella, and others. The move signals Disney’s broader strategy to modernize its content pipeline and experiment with new creative tools, though it also raises questions around licensing, moderation, and how fans might use AI-generated Disney assets. Still, it’s a notable shift for a company that has traditionally guarded its IP very tightly. Source:",

      "selftext": "The sentiment in the U.S. stock market has been somewhat nuanced these past few days. On the surface, Oracle's earnings report where cloud revenue fell short of expectations and AI capital expenditures surged again dragged down the entire tech sector. But digging deeper reveals the market's true concern: the first wave of valuation repricing as AI investment shifts from “dream driven” to “cash flow reality.” Over the past year, the AI theme has been virtually the sole driver of the U.S. stock market. From computing power to data centers, from GPUs to optical modules, from large models to application end solutions, the entire chain operated on the principle: “If you dare to invest, I dare to rise.” The problem is when a company projects its next two years of capital expenditures to reach $50 billion, the market is asking for the first time: When will this money translate into actual revenue? Thus, the broader pressure on tech stocks this time around seems unsurprising to me. The S&P and Nasdaq corrected, AI heavyweight stocks weakened in tandem, and Bitcoin followed sentiment lower. Capital began withdrawing from high valuation, high expectation sectors, seeking more stable assets. Even the Fed's recent “hawkish yet dovish” rate cut combination failed to fully shore up market sentiment. Interestingly, the shift from fervor to caution in AI investment doesn't signal an industry peak. On the contrary, it underscores a crucial point: AI isn't dead. The market has finally recognized this isn't a quick victory but a protracted battle of attrition. Factors like sustained investment capacity, robust balance sheets, and genuine customer demand are rapidly gaining importance. Yet another perspective warrants attention: the Fed's signals indicate that rate cuts are not unconditional, but rather a cautious maneuver following inflation's retreat and growth stabilization. This implies markets must reprice the relationship between interest rates, growth, and risk appetite. While rates are declining, their trajectory is no longer linear this “slow bull market easing” actually benefits non AI sectors. A broader view reveals: AI themes remain robust, but the era of “buying blindly” has passed. Tech giants are entering a capital intensive phase where massive capital expenditures demand clear return pathways to investors. Meanwhile, investors are shifting from “story driven valuations” to “cash flow driven valuations.” The AI war rages on, but it's now entering the era of the ledger. The future winners may not be the best storytellers, but rather those who can pour $50 billion into development while maintaining profit margins. The true threshold in the AI era has shifted from models to cash flow, from technological narratives to capital endurance races. This correction may well be the first warning signal before a new order emerges.",

Interestingly the shift from fervor to caution in AI investment doesnt signal an industry peak . On the contrary it underscores a crucial point AI isnt dead . The market has finally recognized this isnt a quick victory but a protracted battle of attrition . Factors like sustained investment capacity robust balance sheets and genuine customer demand are rapidly gaining importance . Yet another perspective warrants attention the Feds signals indicate that rate cuts are not_unconditional but rather a cautious maneuver following inflations retreat and growth stabilization . This implies markets must reprice the relationship between interest rates growth and risk appetite . While rates are declining their trajectory is no_longer linear this “ slow bull market easing ” actually benefits non AI sectors . A broader view reveals AI themes remain robust but the era of “ buying blindly ” has passed . Tech giants are entering a capital intensive phase where massive capital expenditures demand clear return pathways to investors . Meanwhile investors are shifting from “ story driven valuations ” to “ cash flow driven valuations. ” The AI war rages on but its now entering the era of the ledger . The future winners may not_be the best storytellers but rather those who can pour $ 50 billion into development while maintaining profit margins . The true threshold in the AI era has shifted from models to cash flow from technological narratives to capital endurance races . This correction may well be the first warning signal before a new order emerges ."

      "selftext": "Bank of America Securities upgraded Visa (V) to a neutral buy rating, citing the stock's recent underperformance but maintaining that the payment network company remains a top tier enterprise. Visa (V) shares rose 1.3% in premarket trading on Thursday. Since October 10, the stock has declined \\~5.1%, while the S&P 500 index has gained 5.1%. The stock's current valuation approaches a decade low amid excessive disruption fears and rotation into AI/risk stocks. “I view this as an attractive opportunity to own one of the world's best companies at reasonable multiples,” Bank of America stated, adding that the $38 billion merchant settlement and regulatory risks should not fundamentally undermine Visa's (V) robust fundamentals. Furthermore, stablecoins represent an opportunity rather than a threat to the company and are likely to enhance its position. Meanwhile, Visa (V) is one of only six S&P 500 companies to achieve 10%+ revenue growth, double digit EPS growth, and an operating margin >50% over the past year, and one of just two companies to have delivered these metrics annually since 2021.",

      "selftext": "This isn't about public stocks; this is about identifying the private sector niche capable of genuine, exponential 5x growth in the long term (3-5 years). A $100K seed investment needs to clear a \\\\$400\\\\text{K} profit barrier via acquisition or a massive funding round to hit the target. Which Sector is the Highest Conviction Bet for a PE/VC-style Exit? Niche SaaS: Known for high margins (70-80%) and solving specific, painful B2B workflow problems. These are prime targets for M&A. Digital Health / Healthcare SaaS: Driven by structural, long-term global demand. Stable growth and strong market tailwinds, making them attractive acquisition targets. Inventive Deep Tech: Highest risk, but highest potential reward. The fusion of complex tech (AI, ML) with unique IP allows for breakthrough valuation growth and CAGRs of 30%-50%. Drop the specific business model that delivers the clearest path to a 5x valuation growth. Important Note: I am not a financial advisor.

The problem is that they show everything so differently that I can't even compare properly, fidelity has all these charts and tables that look professional I guess but are kind of confusing, robinhood is super clean and simple but missing a bunch of info I actually need. Neither one gives me a real picture of my total portfolio allocation or how I'm doing overall. I tried adding everything up manually in my head but that lasted maybe two days before I realized I was spending way too much time on basic math, is everyone else just picking one brokerage and sticking with it or is there actually a good way to see everything together without building some crazy spreadsheet, because honestly I'm not trying to become an excel expert just to track my investments you know.",

The problem is that they show everything so differently that I cant even compare properly fidelity has all these charts and tables that look professional I guess but are kind of confusing robinhood is super clean and simple but missing a bunch of info I actually need . Neither_one gives me a real picture of my total portfolio allocation or how Im doing overall . I tried adding everything up manually in my head but that lasted maybe two days before I realized I was spending way too much time on basic math is everyone else just picking one brokerage and sticking with it or is there actually a good way to see everything together without building some crazy spreadsheet because honestly Im not_trying to become an excel expert just to track my investments you know ."

      "selftext": "During the 2008 financial crisis the housing bubble burst because of mortgages to unqualified borrowers, complex financial products like mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and lax lending standards. So, a faulty system depending on we, the people, paying off mortgages and loans that were not being paid back. Seems a logical cause for a bubble to burst. Before, the dotcom bubble bursted because of extreme overvaluation of companies, which were not performing up to the expectations, so the revenue wasn't there. Now there is obviously an AI bubble as has been pointed out many many times, but currently the companies involved are still meeting their expected revenue goals (looking at NVIDIA, Meta, Google even though that is not strictly an AI-related company, their current valuation is also due to their AI developments). Of course, investing in each other and buying each other's products, causing stocks to rise, is super inflatory, but is not punished so far. It seems. Now, a geopolitical conflict involving a certain chipmaker to not be able to produce would likely pop the bubble overnight. Given the current geopolitical situation and the people involved, this is not unlikely in the coming years. But as long as this doesn't happen it appears to be business as usual, and the AI-race will continue. Now, comparing this to earlier bubbles, the pattern is similar. An industry is pumped to the moon, a bunch of people make an insane amount of money, the bubble bursts and most people get screwed over with a few winners. The question is always: how high will it go when the companies are profitable and how deep will the lows be? As a retail investor who is not trading daily, this situation is extremely difficult and hard to predict when also just having a regular 9 to 5 job. I know I won't be able to predict it, so it is a risk analysis whether the current valuations will be the future lows OR if big companies with PE ratios of 50 are already a selling sign for the retail investor. This would even apply to ETFs like VWRL, since their share of NVDA is also high. The whole market will likely go down when this bubble bursts, just some companies more than others. given earlier arguments, I feel like going short here is stupid. Thereby, world governments are hedging inflation (buying loads of gold), which also has geopolitical implications. Now I believe in the mantra that time in the market beats timing the market but probably needing the money in 3 years or so, the current situation is a spicy sauce. It seems like hedging inflation (e.g. buying gold and funds like Berkshire) is not a bad move.",

      "selftext_processed": "During the 2008 financial crisis the housing bubble burst because of mortgages to unqualified borrowers complex financial products like mortgagebacked securities MBS and lax lending standards . So a faulty system depending on we the people paying off mortgages and loans that were not_being paid back . Seems a logical cause for a bubble to burst . Before the dotcom bubble bursted because of extreme overvaluation of companies which were not_performing up to the expectations so the revenue wasnt there . Now there is obviously an AI bubble as has been pointed out many many times but currently the companies involved are still meeting their expected revenue goals looking at NVIDIA Meta Google even though that is not_strictly an AIrelated company their current valuation is also due to their AI developments . Of course investing in each other and buying each others products causing stocks to rise is super inflatory but is not_punished so far . It seems . Now a geopolitical conflict involving a certain chipmaker to not_be able to produce would likely pop the bubble overnight . Given the current geopolitical situation and the people involved this is not_unlikely in the coming years . But as long as this doesnt happen it appears to be business as usual and the AIrace will continue . Now comparing this to earlier bubbles the pattern is similar . An industry is pumped to the moon a bunch of people make an insane amount of money the bubble bursts and most people get screwed over with a few winners . The question is always how high will it go when the companies are profitable and how deep will the lows be As a retail investor who is not_trading daily this situation is extremely difficult and hard to predict when also just having a regular 9 to 5 job . I know I wont be able to predict it so it is a risk analysis whether the current valuations will be the future lows OR if big companies with PE ratios of 50 are already a selling sign for the retail investor . This would even apply to ETFs like VWRL since their share of NVDA is also high . The whole market will likely go down when this bubble bursts just some companies more than others . given earlier arguments I feel like going short here is stupid . Thereby world governments are hedging inflation buying loads of gold which also has geopolitical implications . Now I believe in the mantra that time in the market beats timing the market but probably needing the money in 3 years or so the current situation is a spicy sauce . It seems like hedging inflation e.g . buying gold and funds like Berkshire is not_a bad move ."

      "selftext": "Interested in hearing people's thoughts on this stock whilst I investigate it further. I'm normally very much an index and chill investor but keep some money on the side to play with and the stock is really taking my fancy recently. UNITE Group plc currently training at 0.53 of its book value, the stock price is decreased almost 40% in the last year largely due to concerns over acquisitions, lower forecasts for next year's occupancy (down to 93%) and increased cost of servicing it's debt. The price to book value is what originally got me interested, but even following negative guidance for next year (11% drop in revenue). The stock trades at a forward PE of 11 with a forward dividend yield of 7.22% at current price. I believe the finances of the company suggest that the dividend is 'safe' moving forward. I am also bullish over student accommodation in the UK as an industry and whilst they appreciate there is a number of current challenges (increased tax burden on a foreign students, decrease in applications in some areas) I believe this has largely been overblown and UNITE's focus on Russel Group universities with high demand reinforces this. I would value anyone's thoughts on the stock and potential risks which I might want to be investigating as I move through my next steps.",

Im normally very much an index and chill investor but keep some money on the side to play with and the stock is really taking my fancy recently . UNITE Group plc currently training at 0.53 of its book value the stock price is decreased almost 40 % in the last year largely due to concerns over acquisitions lower forecasts for next years occupancy down to 93 % and increased cost of servicing its debt . The price to book value is what originally got me interested but even following negative guidance for next year 11 % drop in revenue . The stock trades at a forward PE of 11 with a forward dividend yield of 7.22 % at current price . I believe the finances of the company suggest that the dividend is safe moving forward . I am also bullish over student accommodation in the UK as an industry and whilst they appreciate there is a number of current challenges increased tax burden on a foreign students decrease in applications in some areas I believe this has largely been overblown and UNITEs focus on Russel Group universities with high demand reinforces this . I would value anyones thoughts on the stock and potential risks which I might want to be investigating as I move through my next steps ."

Given their solid financial results, positive EBITDA, backlog growth, and increasing gross margins, why is the market perception and share price still much lower than some of the more “story-driven” space companies? What factors make PL less “sexy” in the eyes of investors despite having a more stable and fundamental business model?",

Even if a sizable amount of retail traders buy into ta and say they make trades based off of that, that’s still a drop in the ocean compared to the capital wielded by actual institutions which I’m assuming don’t enter/exit with TA. So then, does TA matter in the slightest? If so, what aspects?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how to properly measure whether I’m any good at this, beyond just looking at my portfolio balance going up or down. For context, over the last 5 years I’ve averaged 31.5% per year, holding around 20 stocks at any given time, split across two countries. I usually only have one “Magnificent 7” name at most, the rest is mostly mid- and small-caps. My average holding period is about 8 months, but I do adjust position sizes for risk management and take the occasional swing trade when it makes sense. My lowest low was -30% during 6 months. My framework is a mix of macro themes, cultural trends, and retail sentiment. Now, obviously those returns sound good on paper. But I also know survivorship bias, bull-market tailwinds, luck, volatility exposure, and concentrated bets can distort the picture. So I’m curious how you all think about benchmarking yourselves: - Do you compare everything to the S&P 500 or another major index? (I tend to compare myself vs Nasdaq US) - If you invest internationally, do you use blended benchmarks? - Do you adjust for risk, volatility, drawdowns, or turnover? - Is there a point where comparing to broad indices stops making sense if your style is very different? - And what time horizon is actually meaningful; 3 years? 5? 10? Basically: how do you know if you genuinely have skill, or if you’re just surfing a wave? I’d be really interested to hear how others approach this, especially those who don’t just buy index funds but also aren’t full-time traders.",

      "selftext": "I’m still bearish on Adobe after this earnings report. Yes, revenue grew about ten percent year over year and ARR ended the year roughly eleven percent higher, but the way they achieved that growth raises real concerns. For the first time in recent memory Adobe did not disclose net new user or net new ARR additions in the release. They normally highlight that metric when it is strong. Leaving it out right when they are pushing higher pricing across Creative Cloud and charging for generative AI credits looks intentional. If user growth were healthy they would have said so. What they did report makes the picture clearer. Digital Media revenue rose, but almost all of the lift came from higher average revenue per customer. The company recently increased subscription prices and shifted customers onto more expensive AI enabled plans. That explains why revenue and ARR are up even though they chose not to show how many new users they added. It strongly suggests that the growth came from charging the existing base more, not from expanding the base itself. That strategy can work for a few quarters but it is not sustainable in a market where capable AI based creative tools are becoming dramatically cheaper. Many customers could get similar results at a fraction of Adobe’s pricing if they switched. If user growth is slowing while ARPU rises, eventually the math breaks. When that becomes clearer in future reports the stock will have a harder time justifying its current valuation. That is why I remain bearish here despite the headline beats.",

I started researching option income strategies and the basic concept is just selling time decay instead of waiting for quarterly dividend payments so I spent 5 weeks paper trading before moving 20k from dividends to systematic credit spreads Results so far are pretty different, that 20k was generating about 50 bucks monthly in dividends but now it's generating 350 to 550 monthly selling weekly options, depending on the market conditions and how many trades hit targets, a massive income increase but obviously way more work and risk. What's interesting though is monthly consistency as dividends come quarterly but option premium comes weekly, sometimes daily so it feels more like actual income stream instead of waiting 3 months between payments, the psychological difference is bigger than I expected as well For people who shifted from dividend income to premium income, what percentage feels right? I am thinking maybe 30% in options max, keeping 70% in stable dividends but I'm curious what allocation others landed on after testing both approaches.",

      "selftext": "I am going through specifics of the scam because I know there are people that won't believe they're being scammed unless their scenario matches exactly and entirely. Here's the process 1. They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram, pretending to be another app. When you click on it, it asks you to message a whatsapp number. 2. There are 2 \"important\" people. One is the mentor and one is the advisor. The advisor always direct messages you, and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat. 3. The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around. it's to add legitimacy. 4. They will suggest you stocks. After you buy them, the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots. Q: Why do they ask you for screenshots? A: It's to make you accustomed to the process. They don't need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions. It's useless for them. Edit: following a comment - it's not exactly useless, it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if you're worth their time. The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock. They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut. 5. After 2 months regular stock recommendations. They will advertise and hype up their scam stock, promising 150% gains. They want you to put as much as possible. Just to add on, they don't specify the stock ticker until the last day (Dec 8). They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker, not the stock itself. 6. [chow stock - Google Search]( This was the specific scam stock recommended yesterday. It went up by 20% before dropping 85% today (Dec 10th). It's honestly impressive. 7. I've been too lazy to photoshop/html edit the transactions, so they're trying everything in their power to get me to send the evidence. Including calling me 15 times yesterday and promising a 80% cash back on the imaginary losses. (I told them i invested 100k)",

Heres the process 1 . They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram pretending to be another app . When you click on it it asks you to message a whatsapp number . 2 . There are 2 important people . One is the mentor and one is the advisor . The advisor always direct messages you and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat . 3 . The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around . its to add legitimacy . 4 . They will suggest you stocks . After you buy them the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots . Q Why do they ask you for screenshots A Its to make you accustomed to the process . They dont need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions . Its useless for them . Edit following a comment its not_exactly useless it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if youre worth their time . The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock .

      "selftext": "Hey All, TLDR: MT $70 target book value / fundamental value. Catalysts are huge technical breakout, perfect alignment of fundamentals, and possible gasoline on the fire if the Ukraine war ends, or possible announcements on rare earths like everybody else. They have a lot of mines. I have built a bit of a specialization in steel stocks. Caught the huge run in NUE in 21', the X buyout in '23, and again when it went through among some other trades. I thought I'd share my latest trade idea. Mittal Steel is the largest global steel company outside of China with operations globally. Weekly Chart: Massive breakout and trading at a 12 year high. Global profile in 2nd screen shot. General notes below. 1. MT 1. Target: $70 18X Long Run Earnings conservative, $70.75 Book Value 2. Q EPS Growth: 31.36% 255.75% (14.18%) 86.85% 3. Q REV Growth: 3.03% (1.99%) (9.11%) 1.11% 4. Next Q EPS: 31%, 9%, -5%, 61% 5. Next Q REV: 7%, 3% next two years 6. Catalysts: 7. Technicals 1. Technicals very strong. Trading at a decade high. Huge breakout 2. IWM huge long term breakout 3. Fed QE 4. Long hated stock 8. Fundamentals 1. Probably 2nd best run steel company globally after Steel Dynamics 2. Bought back almost 40% of shares in the last 5 years. Huge ongoing buybacks. 3. USA, EU, Canada Protections and more seem to be coming to keep China steel out. Everywhere MT operates is looking to protect their industry. 4. And over the last four years combined, capital spending amounted to $15.49 billion resulting in $1.9 billion in through cycle EBITDA coming (step change in profitability), Very Cheap, 5. M&A target (BHP, RIO, NUE?), 50% of FCF going to buying back shares. Nearly 40% in the last few years. Nice dividend. 6. China steel exports may or may not be sustainable. Iron ore prices rising. Massive China Stimulus + recovering market. 7. Number 1 global volume outside of China which everybody is putting tariffs on. 8. Trading 1/2 of Revenue, 63% of Book Value 9. Europe waking up. Massive German/Europe Stimulus. Global stimulus. Back to strength globally from trough? Europe Anti dumping cases. 22% USA Profits. 10. Drove at least $3-4 in value taking over Calvert a huge plant when the Nippon deal to acquire U.S. Steel went through. . Strongest price action of all steel companies. New market leader. 9. Catalysts 1. Massive Technical Breakout + Fundamental factors above. 2. If the Ukraine War Ends we will pop massively due to huge steel demand to rebuild. MT has extensive Ukraine and EU assets. 3. Any mention of rare earths it could rocket even if it is a gimmick. Positions",

      "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Self-driving Waymo taxis have gone viral for negative reasons involving the death of a beloved San Francisco bodega cat and pulling an illegal U-turn in front of police who were unable to issue a ticket to a nonexistent driver. But this week, the self-driving taxis are the bearer of happier news after a San Francisco woman gave birth in a Waymo. The mother was on her way to the University of California, San Francisco medical center Monday when she delivered inside the robotaxi, said a Waymo spokesperson in a statement Wednesday. The company said its rider support team detected “unusual activity” inside the vehicle and called to check on the rider as well as alert 911. Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, declined to elaborate on how the vehicle knew something was amiss. The taxi and its passengers arrived safely at the hospital ahead of emergency services. Jess Berthold, a UCSF spokesperson, confirmed the mother and child were brought to the hospital. She said the mother was not available for interviews. Waymo said the vehicle was taken out of service for cleaning after the ride. While still rare, this was not the first baby delivered in one of its taxis, the company said.",

      "selftext": "I stumbled on a chart comparing average annual returns from 1980–2015 for different assets, and it honestly surprised me. According to the data: • Birkin bags: 14.2% annual return • S&P 500: 9.8% annual return • S&P 500 (total returns): 12.7% • Gold: 3.4% The graphic claimed that Birkin bags on the secondary market actually beat both the S&P 500 and gold over that 35 year period. I know luxury goods can appreciate, but I didn’t realize Birkins historically outperformed major asset classes by that much. Obviously they’re not as liquid, and authentication/condition matters a lot, but still… pretty wild. What do you all think? Is investing in Birkins a legit strategy, or is this cherry picked data / survivorship bias? Anyone here actually invest in luxury handbags as part of their portfolio?",

According to the data • Birkin bags 14.2 % annual return • SP 500 9.8 % annual return • SP 500 total returns 12.7 % • Gold 3.4 % The graphic claimed that Birkin bags on the secondary market actually beat both the SP 500 and gold over that 35 year period . I know luxury goods can appreciate but I didn ’ t realize Birkins historically outperformed major asset classes by that much . Obviously they ’ re not_as liquid and authenticationcondition matters a lot but still… pretty wild . What do you all think Is investing in Birkins a legit strategy or is this cherry picked data survivorship bias Anyone here actually invest in luxury handbags as part of their portfolio"

      "selftext": "Summary: 12/10/25 Market Cap: 3.3 Trillion ($3,300,000,000,000) Bitcoin $92K - ($92,000) Ethereum $3.3K - ($3,300) I wanted to know if anyone had collected the same data in the previous few weeks. I might be a little off, and the data might be outdated and inconclusive. Is sharing it with the community safe? I'm taking a risk, but this is what I've read and learned. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. 1. The Federal Reserve Rate Cut: (-.25%) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, December 10, 2025, by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorter-term Treasury securities. Key Decisions and Implications: ⦁ Interest Rate Cut: This is the third consecutive quarter-point rate cut this year. This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy, though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns. ⦁ Bond Purchases (Balance Sheet Policy): The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves. This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening (QT), meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet. This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system, which were showing signs of stress in the repo (repurchase agreement) market. Perspective: BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down -25% (75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025) ⦁ Short term treasuries, quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated (FOMC Chairman) 2. Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia swinging (November) $195 -> $170 -> $183 today ⦁ AI companies (TOP 7) are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events: ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30% recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently. New players are IE. (JPMorgan, Vanguard, Schwab, Morgan Stanley.) ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95% Random Bears Events: ⦁ Government - Shutdown 43 days - influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs - No November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment - Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs - Taxing everyone Random Thoughts: Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service. There are 21,000,000 coins and 95% have been mined. An unknown number of coins have been lost forever. Imagine there are 8,200,000,000 (8.2 billion) humans on earth today. 1 of 4 are Chinese. (25% people on EARTH) 2,000,000,000 (2.0 billion) Chinese. Put this into perspective China are not pro crypto, nor is it legal since its ban in 2021. Meaning, in China you can be literally hanged, if not imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto. Yet, you can mine in China, as they are #3 in the world in this field. The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly, not 2 billion dollars. This number is trillions. Possibly more than gold. It's almost like they are the little kid who can't play with the big kids when playing sports. They are hindered by the government's choices for freedom of investments.",

I might be a little off and the data might be outdated and inconclusive . Is sharing it with the community safe Im taking a risk but this is what Ive read and learned . Please correct me if Im mistaken . 1 . The Federal Reserve Rate Cut .25 % Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting today December 10 2025 by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5 % 3.75 % . The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorterterm Treasury securities . Key Decisions and Implications ⦁ Interest Rate Cut This is the third consecutive quarterpoint rate cut this year . This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns . ⦁ Bond Purchases Balance Sheet Policy The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorterterm Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves . This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening QT meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet . This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system which were showing signs of stress in the repo repurchase agreement market . Perspective BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down 25 % 75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025 ⦁ Short term treasuries quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated FOMC Chairman 2 . Artificial Intelligence Nvidia swinging November $ 195 $ 170 $ 183 today ⦁ AI companies TOP 7 are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No_quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30 % recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently . New players are IE . JPMorgan Vanguard Schwab Morgan Stanley . ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95 % Random Bears Events ⦁ Government Shutdown 43 days influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs No_November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs Taxing everyone Random Thoughts Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service . There are 21000000 coins and 95 % have been mined . An unknown number of coins have been lost forever . Imagine there are 8200000000 8.2 billion humans on earth today . 1 of 4 are Chinese . 25 % people on EARTH 2000000000 2.0 billion Chinese . Put this into perspective China are not_pro crypto nor is it legal since its ban in 2021 . Meaning in China you can be literally hanged if not_imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto . Yet you can mine in China as they are 3 in the world in this field . The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly not_2 billion dollars . This number is trillions . Possibly more than gold . Its almost like they are the little kid who cant play with the big kids when playing sports . They are hindered by the governments choices for freedom of investments ."

Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $1.64 expected Revenue: $16.06 billion vs. $16.21 billion expected Oracle’s revenue grew 14% year over year in the quarter that ended Nov. 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $6.14 billion, or $2.14 per share, rose from $3,151 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings exclude stock-based compensation. The company posted $7.98 billion in cloud revenue, more than the $7.92 consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount. Cloud infrastructure revenue totaled $4.1 billion. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been recognized, soared 438% to $523 billion, topping the $501.8 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount. Doug Kehring, Oracle’s principal financial officer, said in the release that RPO were driven “by new commitments from Meta, Nvidia and others.” The stock plummeted 23% in November, its worst monthly performance since 2001 and, as of Wednesday’s close, is 32% below its record reached in September. Still, the shares are up 34% for the year, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 22% over that stretch. Oracle generated $5.88 billion in software revenue, down 3% and lower than StreetAccount’s $6.06 billion consensus. Source:",

      "selftext": "Major Drilling is a high leverage play on the potential new exploration supercycle, as the West seeks independence from China in critical minerals and rare earth elements. Demand for metals like copper, nickel, lithium, silver, and rare earths is rising due to military technology, AI infrastructure, robotics, and electrification. Strong gold and silver prices further support exploration budgets. This is expected to drive junior and senior mining companies to drill extensively. Major Drilling benefits as a global market leader with 45 years of experience in precision core drilling, and its archaeology services provide an edge in permitting and community relations. During the 2010 cycle, the stock traded at 21 CAD. Adjusting for the US M2 money supply expansion of about 2.79 times since 2007 gives a conservative price target of roughly 33 to 36 CAD. The theoretical peak adjusted for money supply would be above 58 CAD. Current price is around 13.60 CAD, with a market cap of approximately 1.1 billion CAD. The next earnings report on December 10 could act as a catalyst. Risks include exploration cycle volatility, execution challenges with fleet and labor expansion, and macroeconomic slowdowns that could delay project starts. Nfa. Dyor.",

Demand for metals like copper nickel lithium silver and rare earths is rising due to military technology AI infrastructure robotics and electrification . Strong gold and silver prices further support exploration budgets . This is expected to drive junior and senior mining companies to drill extensively . Major Drilling benefits as a global market leader with 45 years of experience in precision core drilling and its archaeology services provide an edge in permitting and community relations . During the 2010 cycle the stock traded at 21 CAD . Adjusting for the US M2 money supply expansion of about 2.79 times since 2007 gives a conservative price target of roughly 33 to 36 CAD . The theoretical peak adjusted for money supply would be above 58 CAD . Current price is around 13.60 CAD with a market cap of approximately 1.1 billion CAD . The next earnings report on December 10 could act as a catalyst . Risks include exploration cycle volatility execution challenges with fleet and labor expansion and macroeconomic slowdowns that could delay project starts . Nfa . Dyor ."

Im a billionaire and I buy 1 billions dollars worth of QQQ while the Mag 7 are selling off . Would the selloff in each of the Mag 7 stop and reverse course Even though Im purchasing the QQQ Would NQ mimic the QQQ There are so many permutations of this . I.e . what if I buy 1 billion dollars worth of NQ does the QQQ follow Etc . Im just wondering whats actually moving the QQQspy . Is it the underlying stocks or actual purchase of the etf Is the tail wagging the dog or is the dog wagging the tail"

      "selftext": "Some possible consequences: * End of the \"Restrictive\" Phase: By labeling the current range as neutral, the Fed signals that its post-hike monetary policy is no longer actively restrictive or braking the economy. * Discussion goes from \"how much more easing is needed?\" to \"how long will we stay here?\" * Increased Market Uncertainty: Powell's estimate is notably higher than the 3.0% for the neutral rate among FOMC members. This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board. If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50%–3.75%, the Fed may be passively tightening, leading to a slower growth outlook. If the market believes the Fed is now neutral, it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress, or drop in inflation. * The bar for future rate cuts is now higher. The Fed may be willing to hold rates at this level for an extended period, which could push up longer-term yields. In sum: stocks may still rise, but the rates of rising will be more muted, and the probabilities of flat to down moves higher",

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday, but the decision came with unusually visible internal disagreement. The FOMC lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a 3.5%–3.75% range. While the move was widely expected, the tone around the announcement was far more cautious than markets were hoping for. The vote itself highlighted how divided policymakers have become. Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected. The Fed is easing, but not without hesitation and not without signaling that future moves are far from guaranteed. Source:",

Shares have been swinging around as investors debate whether the company’s heavy push into AI infrastructure will actually pay off at the pace management expects. That debate got louder after Oracle raised $18 billion in debt back in September, which added financial leverage right as spending ramps up. On top of that, the company also announced leadership changes during the quarter, naming Clay Magouyrk and Mike Sicilia as successors to CEO Safra Catz. So this earnings call isn’t just about quarterly numbers it’s also about whether the AI strategy looks financially sustainable and how the market feels about the next generation of leadership taking charge.

      "selftext": "The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘AI bubble’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days. If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the S&P 500’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. The current multiple looks elevated, compared against a long-term average of ~15/16x. The conclusion is always the same: “The market is expensive. A mean reversion is inevitable. We are in an AI bubble.” Let me start by making clear, this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples, not to say the market PE isn’t elevated. I am not saying that ‘this time is different’… BUT some things are different. Notably, the accounting rules we use to define the ‘E’ in P/E.” Comparing the S&P500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is apples-to-oranges comparison. This common comparison assumes that the “E” (Earnings) in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “E” in 2025. It doesn’t. Over the last two decades, there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits. Almost every single change has made today’s accounting more conservative, suppressing reported earnings compared to the past. Those changes were made for a reason, much of today’s accounting is more transparent, it is more rational, but it makes comparison cloudy. Let’s look at what’s changed and what the impact has been… The SBC Distortion: The Core 10-15% Earnings Drag: The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stock-based compensation (SBC). Did you know that stock-based compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006? Before 2006, companies could issue massive stock options, dilute shareholders, and report zero expense on the income statement. SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS). That ended with FAS 123(R), which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other share-based payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes. Today, rightfully so, SBC is a required, non-cash, impact on earnings. It belongs in the income statement as an expense. Buffett and Munger agree, commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter, prior to the accounting rule changes described above. \"A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: “If options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?”\" (Cool Note: Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time, opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders, voluntarily.) On the change: \"Though the two (incentive) plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result. This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations. In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed.\" (Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost.) The Impact: SBC now accounts for roughly 10-15% of total S&P 500 earnings. If we reverted to 1999 rules, we would add that expense right back into the bottom line, drastically increasing bottom line earnings. Here’s a real world example. Let’s look at Microsoft ($MSFT) using current numbers (Q3 2025 Numbers). Looking at the financials, we can see the SBC impact on its valuation. Current Numbers: Price (12/6/25): $483.15 Market Cap: ~$3.59 trillion TTM Net Income: $104.91 billion Diluted EPS: $14.1 GAAP PE: ~34.26x Pre-2006 Accounting Adjustment: TTM Stock Based Compensation: $12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income (excluding SBC): $104.91b + $12.12b = $117.03b (-12.12% expense) Adjusted PE Ratio: ~30.6x or a roughly 11% discount Now let’s look at Microsoft ($MSFT) during the 2000 peak. Reported Numbers 2000: Market Cap (Peak): ~$600 billion Reported Operating Income: $11b Reported Net Income: ~9.4 billion Diluted EPS: $1.70 Headline PE: ~62.82x Adjusted Numbers (applying current day accounting rules): Market Cap (Peak): ~$600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC: $9.11b (-17.2% impact) Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC: ~8.1b (-13% impact) Diluted EPS: $1.57 (-12.9% impact) Adjusted PE: ~74.07x MSFT 2001 and 2002: The gap widens… 2001: Reported Operating Income: $11.72b vs. Pro Forma: $8.34b (-28.8% impact) Reported Net Income: $7.35b vs Pro Forma: $5.08b (-30.9% impact) Reported Diluted EPS: $1.32 vs Pro Forma: $0.91 (-31.1% impact) Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $73.68 Headline ‘reported’ PE: 55.81x vs Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 80.96x 2002: Reported Operating Income: $11.91b vs. Pro Forma: $8.27b (-30.6% impact) Reported Net Income: $7.83b vs Pro Forma: $5.36b (-31.5% impact) Reported Diluted EPS: $1.41 vs Pro Forma: $0.98 (-30.5% impact) Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $60.38 Headline ‘reported’ PE: 42.82x vs Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 63.65x When you take required reporting changes into account, the picture changes. But SBC isn’t the only accounting change holding back earnings... Regarding Intangibles: Beyond SBC, the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the S&P500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets (factories, plants, equipment) to intangible assets (IP, software) and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation. For reference: Back in 1975, intangible assets made up just 17% of assets on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies. Less than 50 years later, intangible assets exceed 90% of total assets on balance sheets. This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. While Goodwill amortization went away, in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new, massive expense: Amortization of Definite-Lived Intangibles. When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B, a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets (Patents, Developed Technology, Customer Lists, etc.) Unlike Goodwill, these MUST be amortized. Because M&A volume is so much higher today (and tech valuations are higher), this amortization expense has exploded. For the S&P 500, this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP (reported) earnings and Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings, amounting to over $140 Billion per year in expenses. In other words, that is a -6% drag on the S&P 500s net income, further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods. Regarding R&D and the ‘Missing Amortization’: The US economic and S&P500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a tech/innovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples. The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts. This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic. Keep in mind, we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “capex light” tech companies are becoming more “capex heavy,” yet, the point still stands. Old Economy: If you build a factory, you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years. The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation. New Economy (Software/Tech): If you spend billions on R&D to build software, you must expense it immediately. Because Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google spend massive amounts on R&D ($211B+ combined annually as of FY2024), their reported earnings are impacted immediately, where an industrial company re-investing in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades, drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings. According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin: \"The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets. Accounting, the means by which financial information is presented, treats tangible and intangible investments differently. This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings. Most intangible investments appear on the income statement. Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures. The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount. This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company’s operations. Given the assumptions we use, the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the S&P 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported. These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time.\" Taking this into account, earnings would be higher than 12% currently and the PE Ratio would be lower. So, while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization, they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of R&D and the amortization of acquired tech. The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules. But What Even Is the S&P 500? Finally, let’s address the common complaint about the index itself: “The S&P 500 is too top-heavy. The market is so concentrated.” Somewhere along the way, the S&P 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself, serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market. But the S&P500 is a market-cap weighted index by design. It is not meant to be a representation of the average business; it is a momentum strategy. The index is built to reward our economy’s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers. When people complain that “the Mag7 is driving the index” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended. I see so many arguments that the “Mag 7” (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia, etc.) are distorting the market. But looking at them as just “7 stocks” is a mistake. They are diversified conglomerates. The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70. • ⁠Amazon is a retailer, a logistics company, an advertising agency, and a Cloud hyperscaler, that is building satellites and working on robots… • ⁠Microsoft is enterprise SaaS, Cloud hyperscaler, Gaming studio. • ⁠Google is a Cloud hyperscaler, leading AI developer, the largest search business, advertiser, streaming service, AV operator, soon to be TPU business. These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not because of hype, but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products, services, and financial results to match. Their net profit margins hover around ~26%, roughly double the S&P 500 average of ~13%. They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion. The S&P500 Index is not your only access to the stock market. You are not a forced buyer. Viewing the S&P 500 as the only “investable universe” is misleading. We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research. No one is forcing you to buy the market-cap weighted index. Not happy with the composition? Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended. Worried about concentration? Buy the Equal Weight S&P 500. If you choose to buy the S&P500 index, you are making an active choice to bet on the winners. Stop being upset when they win. Conclusion: The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn’t arguing “this time is different,” but rather that the accounting is different. To create a consistent comparison of S&P500 valuations, we have to level the playing field. Remember, this is an exercise in expanding your perspective. I strongly prefer today’s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation. In no way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed. What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different. Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market really looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s. Here is the step-by-step impact on the S&P 500 P/E ratio (currently ~29x) if we revert to historical rules: The “SBC” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We add back the mandatory 10-15% Stock-Based Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s. • ⁠The Impact: Earnings rise ~12.5% (midpoint). • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 29x to ~25.8x. The “R&D Innovation” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We keep the SBC add-back AND we capitalize R&D expenses (treating them as assets/investments like factories, rather than immediate costs). • ⁠The Impact: As noted by Morgan Stanley, this boosts earnings by another ~12%. • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 25.8x to ~23.0x. A “Full Scope” Adjustment • ⁠The Change: We include the above, PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through M&A. • ⁠The Impact: We add back a conservative ~3% drag (discounting from the full 6% to account for historical M&A activity). • ⁠The Result: The P/E drops from 23.0x to ~22.3x. The Reverse Adjustment: Today’s accounting applied to the past Finally, let’s look at it the other way. What happens if we take the historical markets of the dot-com era and apply today’s accounting rules? • ⁠If we applied today’s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak, earnings would have been ~10-20% lower. • ⁠The peak P/E of the Dot-Com bubble wasn’t 30x... by today’s standards it was ~34x - 38x. When you compare a 22.3 - 25.8x market (Adjusted to 1990s Rules) to a 30.5x market (The 2000 Peak under 1990s Rules), some of the bubble talk can subside. Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited all-time average of 16x. The market is trading at a premium, but, in my opinion, is not in a bubble. We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples. Thanks for reading.

      "selftext_processed": "The Broken Yardstick Why Your “ Historic ” PE Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘ AI bubble ’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days . If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the SP 500 ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio . The current multiple looks elevated compared against a longterm average of 1516x . The conclusion is always the same “ The market is expensive . A mean reversion is inevitable . We are in an AI bubble. ” Let me start by making clear this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples not_to say the market PE isn ’ t elevated . I am not_saying that ‘ this time is different ’ … BUT some things are different . Notably the accounting rules we use to define the ‘ E ’ in PE. ” Comparing the SP500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is applestooranges comparison . This common comparison assumes that the “ E ” Earnings in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “ E ” in 2025 . It doesn ’ t . Over the last two decades there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits . Almost every single change has made today ’ s accounting more conservative suppressing reported earnings compared to the past . Those changes were made for a reason much of today ’ s accounting is more transparent it is more rational but it makes comparison cloudy . Let ’ s look at what ’ s changed and what the impact has been… The SBC Distortion The Core 1015 % Earnings Drag The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stockbased compensation SBC . Did you know that stockbased compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006 Before 2006 companies could issue massive stock options dilute shareholders and report zero expense on the income statement . SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share EPS . That ended with FAS 123R which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other sharebased payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes . Today rightfully so SBC is a required noncash impact on earnings . It belongs in the income statement as an expense . Buffett and Munger agree commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter prior to the accounting rule changes described above . A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not_yet received an answer “ If options aren ’ t a form of compensation what are they If compensation isn ’ t an expense what is it And if expenses shouldn ’ t go into the calculation of earnings where in the world should they go ” Cool Note Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders voluntarily . On the change Though the two incentive plans are an economic wash the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result . This AliceinWonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations . In effect accounting principles offer management a choice Pay employees in one form and count the cost or pay them in another form and ignore the cost . Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed . Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost . The Impact SBC now accounts for roughly 1015 % of total SP 500 earnings . If we reverted to 1999 rules we would add that expense right back into the bottom line drastically increasing bottom line earnings . Here ’ s a real world example . Let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT using current numbers Q3 2025 Numbers . Looking at the financials we can see the SBC impact on its valuation . Current Numbers Price 12625 $ 483.15 Market Cap $ 3.59 trillion TTM Net Income $ 104.91 billion Diluted EPS $ 14.1 GAAP PE 34.26x Pre2006 Accounting Adjustment TTM Stock Based Compensation $ 12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income excluding SBC $ 104.91b $ 12.12b $ 117.03b 12.12 % expense Adjusted PE Ratio 30.6x or a roughly 11 % discount Now let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT during the 2000 peak . Reported Numbers 2000 Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Reported Operating Income $ 11b Reported Net Income 9.4 billion Diluted EPS $ 1.70 Headline PE 62.82x Adjusted Numbers applying current day accounting rules Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC $ 9.11b 17.2 % impact Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC 8.1b 13 % impact Diluted EPS $ 1.57 12.9 % impact Adjusted PE 74.07x MSFT 2001 and 2002 The gap widens… 2001 Reported Operating Income $ 11.72b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.34b 28.8 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.35b vs Pro Forma $ 5.08b 30.9 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.32 vs Pro Forma $ 0.91 31.1 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 73.68 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 55.81x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 80.96x 2002 Reported Operating Income $ 11.91b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.27b 30.6 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.83b vs Pro Forma $ 5.36b 31.5 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.41 vs Pro Forma $ 0.98 30.5 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 60.38 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 42.82x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 63.65x When you take required reporting changes into account the picture changes . But SBC isn ’ t the only accounting change holding back earnings ... Regarding Intangibles Beyond SBC the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the SP500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets factories plants equipment to intangible assets IP software and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation . For reference Back in 1975 intangible assets made up just 17 % of assets on the balance sheets of SP 500 companies . Less than 50 years later intangible assets exceed 90 % of total assets on balance sheets . This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the SP 500 by market capitalization . While Goodwill amortization went away in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new massive expense Amortization of DefiniteLived Intangibles . When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets Patents Developed Technology Customer Lists etc . Unlike Goodwill these MUST be amortized . Because MA volume is so much higher today and tech valuations are higher this amortization expense has exploded . For the SP 500 this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP reported earnings and NonGAAP adjusted earnings amounting to over $ 140 Billion per year in expenses . In other words that is a 6 % drag on the SP 500s net income further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods . Regarding RD and the ‘ Missing Amortization ’ The US economic and SP500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a techinnovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples . The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts . This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic . Keep in mind we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “ capex light ” tech companies are becoming more “ capex heavy ” yet the point still stands . Old Economy If you build a factory you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years . The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation . New Economy SoftwareTech If you spend billions on RD to build software you must expense it immediately . Because Amazon Microsoft Meta and Google spend massive amounts on RD $ 211B combined annually as of FY2024 their reported earnings are impacted immediately where an industrial company reinvesting in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings . According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets . Accounting the means by which financial information is presented treats tangible and intangible investments differently . This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings . Most intangible investments appear on the income statement . Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures . The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount . This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company ’ s operations . Given the assumptions we use the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the SP 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported . These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time . Taking this into account earnings would be higher than 12 % currently and the PE Ratio would be lower . So while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of RD and the amortization of acquired tech . The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules . But What Even Is the SP 500 Finally let ’ s address the common complaint about the index itself “ The SP 500 is too topheavy . The market is so concentrated. ” Somewhere along the way the SP 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market . But the SP500 is a marketcap weighted index by design . It is not_meant to be a representation of the average business it is a momentum strategy . The index is built to reward our economy ’ s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers . When people complain that “ the Mag7 is driving the index ” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended . I see so many arguments that the “ Mag 7 ” Microsoft Apple Google Nvidia etc . are distorting the market . But looking at them as just “ 7 stocks ” is a mistake . They are diversified conglomerates . The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70 . • ⁠Amazon is a retailer a logistics company an advertising agency and a Cloud hyperscaler that is building satellites and working on robots… • ⁠Microsoft is enterprise SaaS Cloud hyperscaler Gaming studio . • ⁠Google is a Cloud hyperscaler leading AI developer the largest search business advertiser streaming service AV operator soon to be TPU business . These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not_because of hype but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products services and financial results to match . Their net profit margins hover around 26 % roughly double the SP 500 average of 13 % . They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion . The SP500 Index is not_your only access to the stock market . You are not_a forced buyer . Viewing the SP 500 as the only “ investable universe ” is misleading . We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research . No_one is forcing you to buy the marketcap weighted index . Not_happy with the composition Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended . Worried about concentration Buy the Equal Weight SP 500 . If you choose to buy the SP500 index you are making an active choice to bet on the winners . Stop being upset when they win . Conclusion The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn ’ t arguing “ this time is different ” but rather that the accounting is different . To create a consistent comparison of SP500 valuations we have to level the playing field . Remember this is an exercise in expanding your perspective . I strongly prefer today ’ s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation . In no_way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed . What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different . Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market really looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s . Here is the stepbystep impact on the SP 500 PE ratio currently 29x if we revert to historical rules The “ SBC ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We add back the mandatory 1015 % StockBased Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s . • ⁠The Impact Earnings rise 12.5 % midpoint . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 29x to 25.8x . The “ RD Innovation ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We keep the SBC addback AND we capitalize RD expenses treating them as assetsinvestments like factories rather than immediate costs . • ⁠The Impact As noted by Morgan Stanley this boosts earnings by another 12 % . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 25.8x to 23.0x . A “ Full Scope ” Adjustment • ⁠The Change We include the above PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through MA . • ⁠The Impact We add back a conservative 3 % drag discounting from the full 6 % to account for historical MA activity . • ⁠The Result The PE drops from 23.0x to 22.3x . The Reverse Adjustment Today ’ s accounting applied to the past Finally let ’ s look at it the other way . What happens if we take the historical markets of the dotcom era and apply today ’ s accounting rules • ⁠If we applied today ’ s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak earnings would have been 1020 % lower . • ⁠The peak PE of the DotCom bubble wasn ’ t 30x ... by today ’ s standards it was 34x 38x . When you compare a 22.3 25.8x market Adjusted to 1990s Rules to a 30.5x market The 2000 Peak under 1990s Rules some of the bubble talk can subside . Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited alltime average of 16x . The market is trading at a premium but in my opinion is not_in a bubble . We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples . Thanks for reading . I hope you found this article interesting and helpful .

The company says the initiative could help create around 1 million jobs, making India one of its most important growth markets outside the U.S. Alongside the investment news, analysts have been taking a fresh look at Amazon’s broader growth outlook. Guggenheim initiated coverage with a Buy rating and a $300 price target, pointing to the company’s expanding global footprint and improving earnings trajectory. Between AWS scaling aggressively, India becoming a major strategic focus, and e-commerce margins improving, analysts seem more confident about Amazon’s long-term setup than they were earlier in the year.

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year? Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026, but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak? A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year. For example, Deutsche Bank set their S&P 500 target at 8,000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex, corporate earnings growth, and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up. Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy, the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates, fiscal policy, and a rebound in more traditional sectors. Put simply, the bulls believe，AI is no longer just a hype story it’s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth. As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there’s still liquidity in the market, stocks could keep climbing. But I’m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive, and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that, the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off, the entire market could get hit hard. And then there’s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties. This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy. History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment, politics, or interest rates no matter how strong the bull feels. So here’s my approach going into 2026， I’ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future, but I’m not going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “high upside but high risk” long term bet. The rest stays diversified cyclicals, value, defensive names, low valuation sectors as the hedge.I’m not putting all my hopes into a single sector. And mentally, I’m prepared If tech swings hard, I’m not going to panic sell or blindly average down. If valuations correct to a reasonable level, I’d consider buying more in small batches. So what about you?For the 2026 U.S. market, are you leaning more toward:the bull continues”or sharp pullback ， big volatility”? Will you keep betting on tech and AI? Or play it safer with more defensive positioning? What kind of split would you choose? And which risks worry you the most",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately I ’ ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026 but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year . For example Deutsche Bank set their SP 500 target at 8000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex corporate earnings growth and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up . Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates fiscal policy and a rebound in more traditional sectors . Put simply the bulls believe，AI is no_longer just a hype story it ’ s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth . As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there ’ s still liquidity in the market stocks could keep climbing . But I ’ m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off the entire market could get hit hard . And then there ’ s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties . This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy . History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment politics or interest rates no_matter how strong the bull feels . So here ’ s my approach going into 2026， I ’ ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future but I ’ m not_going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “ high upside but high risk ” long term bet . The rest stays diversified cyclicals value defensive names low valuation sectors as the hedge.I ’ m not_putting all my hopes into a single sector . And mentally I ’ m prepared If tech swings hard I ’ m not_going to panic sell or blindly average down . If valuations correct to a reasonable level I ’ d consider buying more in small batches . So what about youFor the 2026 U.S. market are you leaning more towardthe bull continues ” or sharp pullback ， big volatility ” Will you keep betting on tech and AI Or play it safer with more defensive positioning What kind of split would you choose And which risks worry you the most"

      "selftext": "Tesla shared updates this week suggesting that its unsupervised Full Self-Driving system is nearing completion, with Elon Musk saying the company is making meaningful progress toward removing the need for human supervision. Around the same time, Tesla also rolled out fresh incentives on the Model Y to support demand, which helped the stock move about 2.5% higher on the day. While neither development is completely new on its own FSD timelines have shifted before and incentives have been used frequently the combination of software progress and sales support seems to be keeping investor sentiment steady for now. It also highlights Tesla’s continued shift toward positioning itself as more than just an EV company, leaning further into AI and autonomy while trying to protect delivery volumes in a competitive market. Curious how others are viewing this: meaningful progress this time, or just another step in a long roadmap?",

The move would give the US an 18-month advantage over China in terms of what AI chips customers in each market receive, with American buyers retaining exclusive access to the latest products, the person said. White House officials concluded that pushing the H200 into China would prod Chinese AI developers into building on the US tech ecosystem rather than turning to offerings from Huawei or other local chipmakers.

The move would give the US an 18month advantage over China in terms of what AI chips customers in each market receive with American buyers retaining exclusive access to the latest products the person said . White House officials concluded that pushing the H200 into China would prod Chinese AI developers into building on the US tech ecosystem rather than turning to offerings from Huawei or other local chipmakers ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business. >Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.” >Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. >Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades. >Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses. >“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement. >That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD. >But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit. >“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Waymo Alphabet Inc. ’ s selfdriving tech unit expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan . It ’ s the first time that the company which started in 2009 as the Google SelfDriving Car project has set a hard target for its business . Currently the Mountain View Californiabased company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix Los Angeles San Francisco and Bay Area communities Austin Atlanta and as of last month Miami . That ’ s “ a number that we ’ re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026 ” Waymo said in a blog post . “ As we look to 2026 we ’ re laying the early groundwork for ridehailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026 including international cities like Tokyo and London. ” Waymo doesn ’ t share financial data but various estimates suggest it makes at least $ 20 per ride which adds up to more than $ 20 million a month . At 1 million rides per week its annualized revenue would hit about $ 1 billion a milestone for the earlystage robotaxi market . To handle that volume of rides the company ’ s fleet will likely expand to at least 10000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2500 now likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar IPace SUVs . Though the service has proved popular with riders Waymo ’ s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges . The company ’ s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco for example following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors . Last month a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street . Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company which hasn ’ t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans needs to make additional safety upgrades . Additionally Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses . “ While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better ” Mauricio Peña Waymo ’ s Waymos chief safety officer said in a statement . That said Waymo ’ s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space including General Motors ’ Cruise unit which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco . Tesla whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its socalled Full SelfDriving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use . Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it ’ s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD . But while Waymo ’ s safety issues so far haven ’ t been as serious some critics think it ’ s expanding too fast perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit . “ We are left to wonder why the world ’ s most experienced driver ’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience ” Phil Koopman an autonomous driving researcher and CarnegieMellon University professor said in a blog post . “ Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can ’ t shrug off . It ’ s unclear which will happen first ."

      "title": "2026 Stock Market Outlook: How Long Can the AI Hype Last Amid Policy Risks and Election Uncertainty?",
      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

      "selftext": "I just learned this today, so maybe I'm slow. I've never really looked into how the Dow is constructed or what companies made up the Dow 30. I assumed that, because it was referred to as the \"industrial average,\" that it was basically an \"ex-tech\" index. That isn't true. What was more surprising, though, was finding out it's weighted by stock price. This doesn't make any sense, as far as I can tell. Why is this?

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Hope you’re all good. I’m planning to do pie long time investment, a 250£ per week, as I’m based in the UK. Basically I’m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£, but this is in the case but let’s start on 250£. I have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 - VUAG, but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold. I have two questions; as I’m using trading212, for example if someone mentioned ticker VT is that means on my app/market(UK) VT will be exactly the same like in USA market for example? Another question what do you think what strategy on my place would be the best with % allocation and any ideas what to look for? Thank you so much!",

      "selftext": "WeRide approach in 2 folds: regulatory and partnership Regulatory: they operate in 8 different countries and 11 cities (Singapore, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Belgium, France, Switzerland, China and US). WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi, outside of US. They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage. We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries. Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases. Also, WeRide enters ADAS market, partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market. Institutional side: recently, ARK Invest purchased 858,295 shares of WeRide and extra 17,326 shares bia ARKQ. BofA, City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock, showing a long-term confidence in them. Their shareholders include: Fidelity, Greenwoods, Hudson Bay, Invesco, M&G, Mirae Asset, Morgan Stanley IM, Temasek, and NVIDIA. This is a super heavy capital industry and not cheap to operate. It's not realistic to expect them to have profits right away. However, when you look closely into their strategy, their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance, you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter. Imo, this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years, they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing on press.",

WeRide received L4 driverless city permit in Abu Dhabi outside of US . They turned their permits and reg approvals into real operating advantage . We can clearly see that WeRide is the first mover and leader in those countries . Working with Grab and Uber to operate their fleets gives them an access to huge target bases . Also WeRide enters ADAS market partnered with Bosch gives them more credibility in the auto market . Institutional side recently ARK Invest purchased 858295 shares of WeRide and extra 17326 shares bia ARKQ . BofA City and BOCI all applied a BUY rating on this stock showing a longterm confidence in them . Their shareholders include Fidelity Greenwoods Hudson Bay Invesco MG Mirae Asset Morgan Stanley IM Temasek and NVIDIA . This is a super heavy capital industry and not_cheap to operate . Its not_realistic to expect them to have profits right away . However when you look closely into their strategy their partnerships and especially their Q3 performance you can see the numbers have been improving quarter to quarter . Imo this company is having a huge potential in the whole auto space in the next few years they doing the real things instead of saying and doing nothing_on press ."

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I kindly ask if anyone could give me their opinion on this splendid but suffering stock. I invested at the beginning of the year, so I am currently at a significant loss. I have averaged several times, bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC. At the moment, I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to: \\- hold the position \\- increase it \\- give up and take the loss. What are you doing? Looking at the company's financial statements over the last few years, I see stability and growth, so I don't understand why it has fallen almost 30% from its highs in such a short time. Please don't tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never played in that league, at least as far as the public is concerned. Many thanks in advance to everyone.",

There is a large management fee of 1.5% I believe but it’s worth it if that’s the only way to invest in spacex, for the average retail investor at least. The fund can appear to underperform the market for most of the year but its SpaceX position gets repriced twice a year. The last repricing was last Friday and the fund was up 20%. I have a $50,000 position. Additionally, if you own at least $40,000, you get an invite to their annual investment conference in NYC where Elon musk is regularly a guest speaker. I went this year and heard him talk. Last year Gwyneth Shotwell, COO of SpaceX spoke on stage. They also give out free swag in the form of clothing/bags (made by Figgs, one of their investments) and there are concert/comedian performances for lunch and then a surprise performance for the end. This year it was Pink. Last year it was Michael Buble.",

The fund can appear to underperform the market for most of the year but its SpaceX position gets repriced twice a year . The last repricing was last Friday and the fund was up 20 % . I have a $ 50000 position . Additionally if you own at least $ 40000 you get an invite to their annual investment conference in NYC where Elon musk is regularly a guest speaker . I went this year and heard him talk . Last year Gwyneth Shotwell COO of SpaceX spoke on stage . They also give out free swag in the form of clothingbags made by Figgs one of their investments and there are concertcomedian performances for lunch and then a surprise performance for the end . This year it was Pink . Last year it was Michael Buble ."

      "selftext": "There's been a lot of talk lately about the Fed potentially cutting rates, but with the way things are going, I’m not so sure we’ll see that anytime soon. The economy’s holding up, but tech stocks, especially the high-valuation ones, are facing some serious pressure One big factor is the rise in job openings. More job vacancies are pushing up labor costs, which could hit companies that rely on high-paid talent the hardest. This is a problem for tech stocks, especially in a higher-rate environment where margins are already getting squeezed The other issue is wage inflation. When there’s a shortage of workers, businesses have to pay more to attract and keep talent, which can lead to rising prices across the board. And if that happens, inflation could start ticking up again. If job vacancies keep climbing, the Fed might have no choice but to delay rate cuts or even keep tightening until inflation is under control. It’s clear that they’re focused on inflation, and strong demand in the labor market is a big concern for them. So, I m curious how are you all thinking about this? Are you still bullish on tech, or are you adjusting your strategy given the pressure from higher labor costs and the Fed’s stance?",

      "selftext": "Hey 25M here. In 2024 i finished university and started, I started working as a mechanical engineer. With that i began investing and learning all about it this year. I opted for VUAA. I do roughly €200 a month, i recently did a large sump investment too. I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT. Thats my main investments into the future. I am planning to keep around €6-7k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4% inflation. I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.8-1.3% and they also have investment savings account. But with fees that amounts to about 2.7% and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum. There are various other fees they also do. This doesn't seem viable for me. Also government bonds aren't available/worth it. I am learning and looking into MMFs, bond ETFs etc. People have recommended XEON, which gives around 2.3%. I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs. For example ERNX. Which is about 2.6% However, i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4% and attempt to cover inflation. I don't mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up. Open to all suggestions. I am based in Europe, Slovakia.",

I opted for VUAA . I do roughly €200 a month i recently did a large sump investment too . I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT . Thats my main investments into the future . I am planning to keep around €67k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4 % inflation . I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.81.3 % and they also have investment savings account . But with fees that amounts to about 2.7 % and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum . There are various other fees they also do . This doesnt seem viable for me . Also government bonds arent availableworth it . I am learning and looking into MMFs bond ETFs etc . People have recommended XEON which gives around 2.3 % . I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs . For example ERNX . Which is about 2.6 % However i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4 % and attempt to cover inflation . I dont mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up . Open to all suggestions . I am based in Europe Slovakia ."

      "title": "Figure Technologies is positioned to pioneer the modernization of traditional finance infrastructure with a bridge to digital assets",
      "selftext": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets (i.e. lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks, clearinghouses, and brokers collecting rent on each transaction). The company IPO'd earlier this year at $25 per share behind their mortgage / HELOC platform, which promises “a better mortgage done on blockchain”. A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $730 and takes a median of 10 days to close, compared to industry avg mortgage costs $11.2K and 42 days to close. Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days, and its platform automates 89% of loans from application through underwriting (i.e. borrower doesn’t need to talk to a human). Figure facilitated $6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months, up 29% from the prior year. For comparison, I am seeing JPM Chase originated \\~$38.2 billion and BoA originated \\~$29 billion, while leaders United Wholesale originated \\~$140 Billion in loans in 2024, and Rocket Mortgage \\~$100 Billion (publicly available sources). The point here is FIGR has some traction, but are not main-stream yet. Figure sees an $80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace - based on $2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4% take rate. **Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential** If FIGR’s process works as well as they say it does, which so far it seems to, it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital. Figure’s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paper-driven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana (added to S&P 500 this month) did for the secondary auto market. If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer, you know what I'm talking about. FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC’s, but are positioned to bring tokenized real-world assets and securities to the main stream. And unlike Carvana, FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention (i.e. it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans) – as of 9/30/2025 FIGR’s balance sheet shows $389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations. **FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company** Highlights include 42% YoY revenue growth, 82% gross margin, and $2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter +70% YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY. FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities, up from 168 in the S1 (as of 6/30/2025). The company also announced a first-of-its-kind the launch of a blockchain-native equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares. This has never been done before. **Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize** I am generally bullish on blockchain, stablecoins, and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70’s, and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process (deeds and “wet ink” requirements). Today's regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here. Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes (i.e. they are unnecessarily complex and expensive). These processes are begging to be disrupted. Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration, so if blockchain is going to work, we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed. **Conclusion** Figure, under Mike Cagney’s and Michael Tannenbaum’s leadership, are positioned well to be one of the [MAG 7]( to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing real-world assets and securities as well as stablecoin. If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US, FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen. Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets / blockchain! Not Investment Advice. All opinions are my own. I am long FIGR.",

A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $ 730 and takes a median of 10 days to close compared to industry avg mortgage costs $ 11.2K and 42 days to close . Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days and its platform automates 89 % of loans from application through underwriting i.e . borrower doesn ’ t need to talk to a human . Figure facilitated $ 6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months up 29 % from the prior year . For comparison I am seeing JPM Chase originated $ 38.2 billion and BoA originated $ 29 billion while leaders United Wholesale originated $ 140 Billion in loans in 2024 and Rocket Mortgage $ 100 Billion publicly available sources . The point here is FIGR has some traction but are not_mainstream yet . Figure sees an $ 80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace based on $ 2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4 % take rate . Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential If FIGR ’ s process works as well as they say it does which so far it seems to it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital . Figure ’ s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paperdriven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana added to SP 500 this month did for the secondary auto market . If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer you know what Im talking about . FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC ’ s but are positioned to bring tokenized realworld assets and securities to the main stream . And unlike Carvana FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention i.e . it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans – as of 9302025 FIGR ’ s balance sheet shows $ 389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $ 2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations . FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company Highlights include 42 % YoY revenue growth 82 % gross margin and $ 2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter 70 % YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY . FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities up from 168 in the S1 as of 6302025 . The company also announced a firstofitskind the launch of a blockchainnative equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares . This has never_been done before . Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize I am generally bullish on blockchain stablecoins and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70 ’ s and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process deeds and “ wet ink ” requirements . Todays regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here . Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes i.e . they are unnecessarily complex and expensive . These processes are begging to be disrupted . Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration so if blockchain is going to work we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed . Conclusion Figure under Mike Cagney ’ s and Michael Tannenbaum ’ s leadership are positioned well to be one of the MAG 7 to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing realworld assets and securities as well as stablecoin . If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen . Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets blockchain Not_Investment Advice . All opinions are my own . I am long FIGR ."

      "selftext": "Hey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things. My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues. More than happy to share my screener as well. I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries. I also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage. Below are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion. So here are those companies: **BK Technologies Corp** [ Smaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt. Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong. [ Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital. Latest investor presentation: [ **Synchrony Financial** [ Much larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play. This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation. Latest quarter presentation: [ **Brainsway Ltd - ADR** This one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great. [ ROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ. Another name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash & cash equivalents. Overall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases. This is all FDA approved as well. Their latest investor presentation: [ **Flotek Industries Inc** Just opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil & gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company) Valuation isn't too bad by any means: [ What is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things. Kind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive. [",

One was around what I have learned along the years of investing with like how I screen and how I research things . My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet where Im a GARPy style investor . I dont mind paying fair price for something like Buffet would say Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price . So when I screen I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues . More than happy to share my screener as well . I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research . I actually enjoy doing this since this can basically be a free hobby . You get to learn more about the world around you plus just different industries . I also feel like this is one area you can do well is finding some under the radar names that have little no_analyst coverage . Below are some stocks I just find interesting Doesnt mean you should go out and buy these names but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never_heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion . So here are those companies BK Technologies Corp Smaller company but fundamentals are pretty solid . I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership . This company fits that with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13 % insider ownership . Also has like no_debt . Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not_being that great but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong . Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios . They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them . Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory better margins and improved their working capital . Latest investor presentation Synchrony Financial Much larger market cap here with this one being 28B . Overall its a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8 with a PEG at 0.56 . This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers making them more of a niche play . This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names but just offers a really cheap valuation . Latest quarter presentation Brainsway Ltd ADR This one is way more speculative of a name and not_cheap but the PEG is still about 1.04 since the EPS growth has been great . ROIC is a bit lower but the company is what new to being profitable but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023 . It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters around 27 % growth QoQ . Another name is little debt around 6.75M but has 70M in cash cash equivalents . Overall I just find this company really interesting what they do almost sounds fake . It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders anxious depression obsessivecompulsive disorders smoking addiction bipolar disorders post traumatic stress disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer ’ s disease autism chronic pain multiple sclerosis post stroke rehabilitation and Parkinson ’ s diseases . This is all FDA approved as well . Their latest investor presentation Flotek Industries Inc Just opened a position in them this morning . Theyve been on my screener for a bit but never_looked into them . I tend to stay away from oil gas names really just own like one name in the space FTI which is another fun company Valuation isnt too bad by any means What is wild about this company is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things . Kinds of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth . Gross margins went from like 18.3 % in Sep 2024 to 31.7 % Sept 2025 . Same thing happened with operating margins going from 5.5 % to 16.5 % that same time period . ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive ."

      "selftext": "Honestly, I’m getting tired of looking for value in this market with everything at ATH, so I started digging into unloved sectors. Stumbled across NICE Ltd ($NICE) and the numbers are weirdly good for a stock that’s done nothing lately. Basically, they do the backend software for contact centers (CCaaS) and financial crime prevention. Not sexy, I know. But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money. Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business. Usually, when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition, the multiple expands, but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pure-play cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow. I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings: |Metric|The Numbers|Why I think it matters| |:-|:-|:-| |**Cloud Growth**|**\\~20-22% (Guidance)**|Finally offsetting the legacy churn| |**FinCrime Margin**|**60-62%**|High-margin \"floor\" that funds the AI transition| |**Cash on Hand**|**\\~$1.5B**|Huge safety net, no bankruptcy risk here| |**Valuation**|**Discounted**|Priced like hardware, growing like SaaS| I looked deeper at their \"Actimize\" segment (the high-margin anti-money laundering stuff), and that 60%+ margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can’t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators. The bear case is obviously Amazon. Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors, NICE could get squeezed. Also, they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend, and integration is always a coin toss. I’m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it’s \"boring\" compared to AI chips. Does anyone here have experience with their actual product? Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed?",

Basically they do the backend software for contact centers CCaaS and financial crime prevention . Not_sexy I know . But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money . Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business . Usually when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition the multiple expands but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pureplay cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow . I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings MetricThe NumbersWhy I think it matters Cloud Growth2022 % GuidanceFinally offsetting the legacy churn FinCrime Margin6062 % Highmargin floor that funds the AI transition Cash on Hand $ 1.5BHuge safety net no_bankruptcy risk here ValuationDiscountedPriced like hardware growing like SaaS I looked deeper at their Actimize segment the highmargin antimoney laundering stuff and that 60 % margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can ’ t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators . The bear case is obviously Amazon . Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors NICE could get squeezed . Also they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend and integration is always a coin toss . I ’ m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it ’ s boring compared to AI chips . Does anyone here have experience with their actual product Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed"

The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. # The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** * Cash + stock deal * $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it * Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** * All cash, $30/share * Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) * Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds * And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners * [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( # The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it. Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand. 4. **Content integration is cleaner.** Netflix knows streaming. Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. # The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal. Some analysts say [Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon]( If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin... who do you think has the edge? 3. **Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real.** Combining #1 and #3 streamers? [Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming. [Paramount bid for the entire company]( including CNN, TNT Sports, etc. # What the market is saying * [WBD up 5% to $27]( (above Netflix's $27.75 offer, betting on bidding war) * PSKY up 7% * NFLX down 3% Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins. # The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay [$5.8B breakup fee if blocked]( That's how real the antitrust risk is. If WBD chooses Paramount instead, they owe Netflix a $2.8B breakup fee. Not nothing. Ellison's argument: Paramount is smaller, less antitrust concern, faster close. Counter-argument: Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August. Adding WBD on top? That's a LOT of integration. # My take (worth nothing) I genuinely don't know. The Netflix deal makes strategic sense - they get Harry Potter, DC, HBO originals, and crush the streaming wars permanently. But $17.6B is $17.6B and shareholders might want the cash. The Trump/Ellison relationship is the X factor nobody's pricing correctly imo. # Vote time - who wins? 1. **Netflix** \\- board-approved deal holds, synergies too good, Paramount's bid is desperate 2. **Paramount Skydance** \\- cash is king, regulatory path clearer, Trump admin approves faster 3. **Netflix raises bid** \\- this becomes a $90B+ deal 4. **Neither** \\- regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning. Especially curious what the media/entertainment folks here think about the content library value. *no position in any of these names, just fascinated by the biggest media deal since... ever?*",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so this is getting spicy . We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely dont know who wins here . Want to hear what you all think . Quick background Friday Dec 5 Netflix announced a deal to buy WBDs studio and streaming assets for $ 72B $ 27.75share . This gets them HBO Max Harry Potter Game of Thrones DC Universe The Sopranos etc . Basically 100 years of Warner Bros content 6650 films 50000 TV titles . Monday Dec 8 Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid at $ 30share allcash $ 108.4B enterprise value . David Ellison going directly to shareholders bypassing the WBD board . The premium Paramount is offering $ 17.6 billion more than Netflixs deal . The money behind each bid Netflix $ 72B Cash stock deal $ 5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it Would combine 1 streamer Netflix with 3 HBO Max Paramount Skydance $ 108.4B All cash $ 30share Backed by $ 40.7B from Larry Ellison Davids dad Oracle cofounder Plus funding from Saudi Qatar Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds And Jared Kushners Affinity Partners Bank of America Citi Apollo committed $ 54B in debt The bull case for Netflix winning 1 . Synergies are insane . They have 200M nonHBO Max subscribers globally who could be crosssold HBO content . Revenue synergy is real . 2 . Bank of America literally said the throne is secured on Dec 7 . They see Netflix as the streaming endgame . 3 . They already have a signed deal . WBD board approved it . Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand . 4 . Content integration is cleaner . Netflix knows streaming . Paramount is still figuring out Paramount after the Skydance merger in August . The bull case for Paramount winning 1 . $ 17.6 billion more cash . Money talks . Shareholders might prefer certainty of allcash vs Netflixs stock component . 2 . The Trump card literally . Ellison told CNBC that Trump believes in competition and combining Paramount WBD creates a real competitor to Netflix a real competitor to Amazon . And heres what nobodys_talking about Larry Ellison Davids dad is basically Trumps closest tech ally He hosted a sixfigureperperson Trump fundraiser in 2020 dines with Trump at MaraLago regularly and dropped $ 450M on real estate 20 minutes from MaraLago When asked about TikTok Trump literally said Id love for Larry to do it . Oracle got the Stargate AI deal . Some analysts say Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin ... who do you think has the edge 3 . Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real . Combining 1 and 3 streamers Elizabeth Warren already called it an antimonopoly nightmare . Writers Guild wants it blocked . 4 . Paramount wants the WHOLE thing . Netflix is only buying studios streaming . Paramount bid for the entire company including CNN TNT Sports etc . What the market is saying WBD up 5 % to $ 27 above Netflixs $ 27.75 offer betting on bidding war PSKY up 7 % NFLX down 3 % Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins . The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay $ 5.8B breakup fee if blocked Thats how real the antitrust risk is . If WBD chooses Paramount instead they owe Netflix a $ 2.8B breakup fee . Not_nothing . Ellisons argument Paramount is smaller less antitrust concern faster close . Counterargument Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August . Adding WBD on top Thats a LOT of integration . My take worth nothing_I genuinely dont know . The Netflix deal makes strategic sense they get Harry Potter DC HBO originals and crush the streaming wars permanently . But $ 17.6B is $ 17.6B and shareholders might want the cash . The TrumpEllison relationship is the X factor nobodys_pricing correctly imo . Vote time who wins 1 . Netflix boardapproved deal holds synergies too good Paramounts bid is desperate 2 . Paramount Skydance cash is king regulatory path clearer Trump admin approves faster 3 . Netflix raises bid this becomes a $ 90B deal 4 . Neither regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning . Especially curious what the mediaentertainment folks here think about the content library value . no position in any of these names just fascinated by the biggest media deal since ... ever"

      "selftext": "Seeking a compromise over controlling exports to China, the US Department of Commerce will soon allow the export of powerful Nvidia GPUs that are roughly 18 months behind its most advanced offerings, according to a person with knowledge of the plan. The move, which would send Nvidia H200s to China, seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors. It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government, which has blocked imports of less powerful chips, such as Nvidia’s H20. The move, which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, could bolster Nvidia’s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide. The US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI. But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed, according to people familiar with their thinking. [Source](",

      "title": "MoonLake ($MLTX) YOLO. DD. Divorce.",
      "selftext": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics ($MLTX) YOLO. I added on to my position here today. **I still like the stock.** TL;DR: MoonLake ($MLTX) is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease (CID) powerhouse. We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15, 2025. This is just the beginning. MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market. We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape. DD is available here: [ We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month. PPP is an untapped market; there are no approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year. [ Also, I don’t really like talking about personal details, but here is some context: My personal life is a mess. I’m living out of a hotel right now. My wife kicked me out of the house, removed my access from the Tesla app, and took our only car. [Telsa]( I currently have a rental car, and the internet here is horrible. I’m moving to another one later today; my morning is stacked with meetings. I need to physically move hotels, as well as secure various accounts. My soon-to-be ex-wife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night. I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently, which I already don’t have access to trade. (Side note: If my soon-to-be ex-wife happens to read this: please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children) [Sneaky Links?]( I say this for context; I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while, but there are distractions everywhere. I’ll try and answer any questions as they come up, but that may not be until later because my personal life is a mess, and I think everyone has a right to know what I’m going through for perspective. I said weeks ago here: That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car, maybe a house: [Reddit r\\/InvestingandTrading]( I’m buying another car and likely another house. I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I’m not selling MLTX stock. Luckily, I have other trades like this I can free up capital with: [Silver 100&#37; YTD]( And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver, even at these levels. With the long standing global fiscal deficits, the increasing global debt levels, the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization. Debasement has to accelerate here. This is bullish for real assets. Stock valuations are currently elevated. Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high? TINA. Increasingly, there is no alternative. Holders of debt-based currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power. That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively. Silver is positioned as one of the most attractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand, and a persistent supply deficit. We have already seen cracks in the silver market, and the world needs hard money now more than ever. That just goes to say, as much as I like silver, I like MLTX more. I don’t reduce my silver position lightly. MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career, and the catalysts are staggering: [MLTX Catalyst Pipeline]( I’ve said before I don’t like price targets, and I’ve said MLTX can 3X, 4X, or 5X by next year. Next year is only a few weeks away. MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this. The opportunity across the CID space is huge. A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization. That equates to right around $140 a share. Long-term, MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address. [Possible SLK Indications]( On top of this, MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen. The company is quick, capital-efficient, and transparent. They should not need to dilute going forward; they have a cash runway well into 2027. They are not burdened by any massive debt. Additionally, they have a non-dilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization. This is a management team that respects shareholders. This is a company that I want to be part of. Some context on options: Please be responsible here. MLTX is still a small cap stock. MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity. I can't recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking. I have December 2025 calls because it was a very cost-effective way to gain leverage, and it’s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX. I am willing to lose the entire investment, and to make these pay off, I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don’t expect to be released until well after the expiration date. I am not relying on the official FDA meeting minutes. I expect these things to happen, but the timing is tight. The timing risk is real, and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration, they are worthless. If I had limited capital, I was willing to lose; that’s my lottery ticket. But if they pay off – I’m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options. Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best. A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher. I also have some other short-dated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation; the bulk of my position is as a long-term MLTX shareholder. This is not financial advice. But please take this advice: don’t play the lottery if you don’t have the capital to lose, and do your due diligence first. Not just on MLTX, but any investment.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics $ MLTX YOLO . I added on to my position here today . I still like the stock . TLDR MoonLake $ MLTX is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease CID powerhouse . We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15 2025 . This is just the beginning . MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market . We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape . DD is available here We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month . PPP is an untapped market there are no_approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year . Also I don ’ t really like talking about personal details but here is some context My personal life is a mess . I ’ m living out of a hotel right now . My wife kicked me out of the house removed my access from the Tesla app and took our only car . Telsa I currently have a rental car and the internet here is horrible . I ’ m moving to another one later today my morning is stacked with meetings . I need to physically move hotels as well as secure various accounts . My soontobe exwife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night . I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently which I already don ’ t have access to trade . Side note If my soontobe exwife happens to read this please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children Sneaky Links I say this for context I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while but there are distractions everywhere . I ’ ll try and answer any questions as they come up but that may not_be until later because my personal life is a mess and I think everyone has a right to know what I ’ m going through for perspective . I said weeks ago here That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car maybe a house Reddit rInvestingandTrading I ’ m buying another car and likely another house . I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I ’ m not_selling MLTX stock . Luckily I have other trades like this I can free up capital with Silver 10037 YTD And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver even at these levels . With the long standing global fiscal deficits the increasing global debt levels the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization . Debasement has to accelerate here . This is bullish for real assets . Stock valuations are currently elevated . Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high TINA . Increasingly there is no_alternative . Holders of debtbased currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power . That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively . Silver is positioned as one of the most attractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand and a persistent supply deficit . We have already seen cracks in the silver market and the world needs hard money now more than ever . That just goes to say as much as I like silver I like MLTX more . I don ’ t reduce my silver position lightly . MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career and the catalysts are staggering MLTX Catalyst Pipeline I ’ ve said before I don ’ t like price targets and I ’ ve said MLTX can 3X 4X or 5X by next year . Next year is only a few weeks away . MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this . The opportunity across the CID space is huge . A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization . That equates to right around $ 140 a share . Longterm MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address . Possible SLK Indications On top of this MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen . The company is quick capitalefficient and transparent . They should not_need to dilute going forward they have a cash runway well into 2027 . They are not_burdened by any massive debt . Additionally they have a nondilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization . This is a management team that respects shareholders . This is a company that I want to be part of . Some context on options Please be responsible here . MLTX is still a small cap stock . MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity . I cant recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking . I have December 2025 calls because it was a very costeffective way to gain leverage and it ’ s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX . I am willing to lose the entire investment and to make these pay off I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don ’ t expect to be released until well after the expiration date . I am not_relying on the official FDA meeting minutes . I expect these things to happen but the timing is tight . The timing risk is real and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration they are worthless . If I had limited capital I was willing to lose that ’ s my lottery ticket . But if they pay off – I ’ m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options . Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best . A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher . I also have some other shortdated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation the bulk of my position is as a longterm MLTX shareholder . This is not_financial advice . But please take this advice don ’ t play the lottery if you don ’ t have the capital to lose and do your due diligence first . Not_just on MLTX but any investment . Misinformation is everywhere . Trade smart stay disciplined Richard Doxtator MBA CFA"

      "selftext": "I was writing CCs on Micron (MU) earlier this year and was making decent money on premiums. I ended up writing one in mid July at a $130 strike and ended up timing it poorly when the stock surged (was previously fluctuating between $90 and $110). I ended up rolling the CC to May of next year at the same $130 strike price. Well lo and behold the stock never went down and has since had a historic run and is now sitting at $245… what are my options? Fidelity’s platform allows me to roll or close but at this point I’m not sure what the best option is, if I close the position I’m pretty sure I would be out over $10k. Any help is appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared? I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House: 1. Road to Housing Act - somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren. It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA. Now the house needs to decide if it’s going to add it on their end. Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good. Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2. FOMC meeting. With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices. If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes, things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not stick thing. I don’t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it. Now, there’s a wrinkle here. We don’t have enough construction workers. So from my POV we have two solutions: 1. Lift the cap on H2B workers - which may be done temporarily via executive order, particularly if a housing emergency is declared. 2. Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses. I think Road To Housing is the key element here. It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing, small houses, and cheaper housing. It couldn’t move forward without the government reopening. The government is open and we may get our rate cut. It passed the senate, and the White House wants the house to add it. I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it’s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms. Stocks I bought (see screenshots): Builders and materials: ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured: CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving: RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren’t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck. Manufactured could be huge here, but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes. The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages, 40/50 yr mortgage ideas get put in action. If Hassett replaces JP we’ll probably get the lower rates. Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff, Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago: I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn’t have the manufactured homes builders. I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off. Not financial advice.",

If Hassett replaces JP we ’ ll probably get the lower rates . Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn ’ t have the manufactured homes builders . I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off . Not_financial advice ."
