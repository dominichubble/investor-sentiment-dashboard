      "selftext": "For context: Venezuela was actively brokering deals to sell oil to BRICS nations. BRICS' mandate is to weaken the stranglehold the USD has on global trade and they are backing their efforts with lots and lots of gold. The damage these deals would have done to a dollar already weakened by the administration's trade policies would have been material. The long term knock-on effects would have been disastrous. I don't have the energy to go into the history or importance of the petrodollar but IYKYK. The US invades Venezuela. No more deals. Problem solved. What's not being talked about, at least in this context, is Venezuela's absolutely massive untapped supply of gold. If realized the value could be in the trillions of dollars. Fuck the oil. It's oversupplied. This is a goldrush. BRICS nations as of December were estimated to control 50% of global gold production. Not surprising as there's a rumored gold backed digital currency in the wings (\"The Unit\"). Surprise! The US is now sitting on the largest unmined supply of gold on the planet. More than enough to manipulate gold markets, undermine the \"de-dollarization\" BRICS has been pushing and defend the USD/petrodollar. Unfortunately, almost all that gold is still in the ground. Who's going to get it out? How about Newmont Mining (NEM). They're the largest gold miner in the world with a real presence in South America. Incidentally, their former head of strategy, David Copley, was appointed by Trump to lead his \"National Energy Dominance Council\" and just promoted into the Trumps inner circle as a member of the National Security Counsel. Read that again. This is a long play. LEAPS are your friend. Shares are better. There's obvious upside in a Greenland acquisition. Yes, I know some of you have been on this for a while. Position: 2200 shares NEM Make sure you take your probiotics. Gut health is important my dudes.",

      "selftext_processed": "For context Venezuela was actively brokering deals to sell oil to BRICS nations . BRICS mandate is to weaken the stranglehold the USD has on global trade and they are backing their efforts with lots and lots of gold . The damage these deals would have done to a dollar already weakened by the administrations trade policies would have been material . The long term knockon effects would have been disastrous . I dont have the energy to go into the history or importance of the petrodollar but IYKYK . The US invades Venezuela . No_more deals . Problem solved . Whats not_being talked about at least in this context is Venezuelas absolutely massive untapped supply of gold . If realized the value could be in the trillions of dollars . Fuck the oil . Its oversupplied . This is a goldrush . BRICS nations as of December were estimated to control 50 % of global gold production . Not_surprising as theres a rumored gold backed digital currency in the wings The Unit . Surprise The US is now sitting on the largest unmined supply of gold on the planet . More than enough to manipulate gold markets undermine the dedollarization BRICS has been pushing and defend the USDpetrodollar . Unfortunately almost all that gold is still in the ground . Whos going to get it out How about Newmont Mining NEM . Theyre the largest gold miner in the world with a real presence in South America . Incidentally their former head of strategy David Copley was appointed by Trump to lead his National Energy Dominance Council and just promoted into the Trumps inner circle as a member of the National Security Counsel . Read that again . This is a long play . LEAPS are your friend . Shares are better . Theres obvious upside in a Greenland acquisition . Yes I know some of you have been on this for a while . Position 2200 shares NEM Make sure you take your probiotics . Gut health is important my dudes ."

      "selftext": "While many investors focus on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country’s reopening, digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Nubank ($NU) represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity. Venezuela’s large population, high mobile penetration, and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize. MercadoLibre, with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago, is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market, offering a growth avenue that isn’t immediately obvious to traditional commodity-focused investors. Similarly, Nubank’s technology-driven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population. Unlike conventional banks, Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, offering low-cost, accessible financial products to millions. If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions, Nubank could expand seamlessly, taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address. This potential remains under the radar compared with the headline-grabbing oil and gas plays. Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America, digital adoption, e‑commerce expansion, and financial inclusion, without relying on oil prices or resource exports. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector, these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela’s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance, potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize.",

      "selftext_processed": "While many investors focus on Venezuela ’ s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country ’ s reopening digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre $ MELI and Nubank $ NU represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity . Venezuela ’ s large population high mobile penetration and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize . MercadoLibre with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market offering a growth avenue that isn ’ t immediately obvious to traditional commodityfocused investors . Similarly Nubank ’ s technologydriven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population . Unlike conventional banks Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil Mexico and Colombia offering lowcost accessible financial products to millions . If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions Nubank could expand seamlessly taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address . This potential remains under the radar compared with the headlinegrabbing oil and gas plays . Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America digital adoption e‑commerce expansion and financial inclusion without relying on oil prices or resource exports . For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela ’ s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize ."

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

I guess people who have a lot invested have it spread over multiple things but I ’ m trying to decide which is best to begin with and try to build it up over time . So Im curious what made you choose one over the other or do you invest in both And if you do both did you start with both right away or did you start with one"

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining (like Texas) Given the current context, with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries, I’m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the **long term**? Going past Venezuela... From what I could find, names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero, Marathon, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, PBF, and Motiva (Aramco). Is this it ? I don't know much about the sector Also, I’m generally not into stock picking. I tend to prefer ETFs",

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years ... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining like Texas Given the current context with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries I ’ m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the long term Going past Venezuela ... From what I could find names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero Marathon ExxonMobil Chevron BP PBF and Motiva Aramco . Is this it I dont know much about the sector Also I ’ m generally not_into stock picking . I tend to prefer ETFs"

Many wise investors say that strategy works until it doesn't, and it will under perform in the long run. Good metaphor i heard -- you're selling lottery tickets for \"pennies\". It's great until someone eventually wins. I've done very well with covered calls over the past few years (often rolling). I'm tempted to continue but know odds would most likely catch up with me. What are your thoughts on covered calls? Do you believe you can outperform \"buy and hold\" over a 10+ year span?",

Nvidia’s Drive platform emphasizes predictability, safety, and modularity, contrasting Tesla’s more aggressive, end to end neural network approach. It’s designed for automakers and fleet operators, not direct to consumer use like Tesla FSD. For this reason, I disagree with the assertion within the article’s title at this time. The Verge’s test ride in a prototype vehicle showed smooth lane changes and merges, cautious behavior at intersections, and strong handling of complex urban scenarios. Nvidia’s platform runs on its Drive Thor chip, a next-gen AI processor designed for autonomous workloads. The system uses sensor fusion, combining lidar, radar, and cameras, for redundancy and reliability, unlike Tesla’s camera only approach. Nvidia is not building its own car but aims to power other automakers’ autonomous systems. Partners include Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Hyundai, who are integrating Nvidia’s tech into upcoming models.

      "title": "Compart may NOT be a bargain",
      "selftext": "First, let me say, I’m a nobody in the stock trading world. I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life. I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late. Well, I’d like to share an observation that I’m not sure people are aware of. Copart is primarily a salvage auction. They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles, as well as other corporate sellers, such as charity donations, some fleet vehicles, and on occasion some dealers. But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage. I’m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not be the bargain people think it is. In 2013-2022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them. Used car prices were high, inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild. You could buy a wreck for 25% of it’s retail value, put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50% of the value of a similar used vehicle. That’s not true anymore. The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult. That’s another major issue. The tech in cars hadn’t quite reached the levels we see today. Parts interchangeability was a lot easier. Today, many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming. This not only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars, but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops. Overall, as these tech laden late model cars age, they’re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components. There’s still money to be made breaking cars apart, but there’s not nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past. Repair costs also continue to climb as parts, supplies and especially skilled labor increases. The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly. People also don’t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves. Especially as used car prices fall. It’s becoming much more attractive to buy in-wrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle. With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots, cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive. If you look at the bid no sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA, and Adesa, you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against. Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair (much of which you won’t know till you dig into the project) when you can buy a clean, in-wrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever. The truth is, there are more good reliable, well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them. Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers. Since the start of the trade war, tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US. Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars. There’s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations. Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company. There’s good reason that their market cap is declining.",

      "selftext_processed": "First let me say I ’ m a nobody_in the stock trading world . I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life . I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late . Well I ’ d like to share an observation that I ’ m not_sure people are aware of . Copart is primarily a salvage auction . They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles as well as other corporate sellers such as charity donations some fleet vehicles and on occasion some dealers . But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage . I ’ m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not_be the bargain people think it is . In 20132022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them . Used car prices were high inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild . You could buy a wreck for 25 % of it ’ s retail value put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50 % of the value of a similar used vehicle . That ’ s not_true anymore . The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult . That ’ s another major issue . The tech in cars hadn ’ t quite reached the levels we see today . Parts interchangeability was a lot easier . Today many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming . This not_only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops . Overall as these tech laden late model cars age they ’ re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components . There ’ s still money to be made breaking cars apart but there ’ s not_nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past . Repair costs also continue to climb as parts supplies and especially skilled labor increases . The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly . People also don ’ t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves . Especially as used car prices fall . It ’ s becoming much more attractive to buy inwrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle . With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive . If you look at the bid no_sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA and Adesa you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against . Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair much of which you won ’ t know till you dig into the project when you can buy a clean inwrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever . The truth is there are more good reliable well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them . Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers . Since the start of the trade war tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US . Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars . There ’ s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations . Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company . There ’ s good reason that their market cap is declining ."

He was going through a litany of things that stop investors from being successful and was clear that boring DCA investing in diverse securities pays better than managed funds 99.999% of the time at 20 years. In that conversation he mentioned that the old joke was that if you wanted to be successful you should put your money into the market and then do nothing. Like don’t move it, don’t change it, don’t mess with it. You are far more likely to mess things up by trading around than you would be if you bought an index fund and then just never sold it. For what it’s worth, I’ve never learned this lesson and now that I’m getting to be older I might just have to try it…",

      "selftext": "Recently, I've seen a lot of discussion about whether SpaceX will go public. I'd like to share my thoughts. Although SpaceX is well-positioned in the rapidly developing aerospace industry, both SpaceX and Elon Musk have repeatedly stated that they have no plans to go public in the short term. They believe that an IPO would create short-term performance pressure, which would be detrimental to their long-term, high-risk space goals (especially the Mars program). SpaceX will only go public after substantial progress has been made on the Mars program. In my opinion, SpaceX doesn't lack funding; it collaborates with several private equity firms and national defense agencies. Its current valuation has already reached super-unicorn levels. A SpaceX IPO is not a matter of time, but a strategic decision. Of course, Starlink could also go public separately, and I believe the likelihood of a Starlink IPO is far higher than that of SpaceX. Therefore, I am very optimistic about Starlink's short-term prospects. Although I know many people dislike Musk, including myself, we are here to make money, so I hope everyone will express their opinions rationally. Thank you.",

      "selftext": "The momentum in ASTS (AST SpaceMobile) is becoming unstoppable. After the powerful rally over the last few days, we are officially knocking on the door of a new All-Time High (ATH) Here are the reasons why I personally believe the stock is about to blast through the ceiling (for reference only): Breakout Above Resistance: Once we clear the previous resistance levels, there is zero overhead supply. This is where the real \"gamma squeeze\" and FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) effect will kick in. When a stock hits an ATH, everyone is in the green, selling pressure drops, and the price can moon much faster than people expect The \"Space 5G\" Narrative: This isn't just a hype-driven rally, it’s a fundamental shift. With the satellites deploying and the partnership with giants like AT&T, the market is finally pricing in the reality of a global space-based cellular network Short Squeeze Potential: There are still plenty of bears trapped in their positions. A breakout to new highs will force them to cover, adding more fuel to the upward rocket I’ve been watching the charts closely, and the \"higher lows\" we’re seeing are a textbook bullish signal. Once the ATH is confirmed, my price target is $100+ I’m not going to hold this stock forever, but I’m definitely staying in for the duration of this breakout cycle. Are you guys adding more at these levels? Or are you just holding for the ride to $120? Let’s hear your price targets!",

After the powerful rally over the last few days we are officially knocking on the door of a new AllTime High ATH Here are the reasons why I personally believe the stock is about to blast through the ceiling for reference only Breakout Above Resistance Once we clear the previous resistance levels there is zero overhead supply . This is where the real gamma squeeze and FOMO Fear Of Missing Out effect will kick in . When a stock hits an ATH everyone is in the green selling pressure drops and the price can moon much faster than people expect The Space 5G Narrative This isnt just a hypedriven rally it ’ s a fundamental shift . With the satellites deploying and the partnership with giants like ATT the market is finally pricing in the reality of a global spacebased cellular network Short Squeeze Potential There are still plenty of bears trapped in their positions . A breakout to new highs will force them to cover adding more fuel to the upward rocket I ’ ve been watching the charts closely and the higher lows we ’ re seeing are a textbook bullish signal . Once the ATH is confirmed my price target is $ 100 I ’ m not_going to hold this stock forever but I ’ m definitely staying in for the duration of this breakout cycle . Are you guys adding more at these levels Or are you just holding for the ride to $ 120 Let ’ s hear your price targets"

Clover becomes a healthcare software company, not just an insurer. 2. Clover AI (Counterpart Health) isn’t admin software, it’s clinical decision intelligence. It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care, improving outcomes directly. The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time. 4. Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast, which is rare in Medicare Advantage. Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏. 5. Insiders collectively own \\\\\\~21% of the company. This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management’s incentives with shareholders. The biggest insider buy was by Co-Founder & Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli, who purchased approximatelyy $1M in shares at \\\\\\~$2.24 each. Market Confidence is back. Note: Not financial advice. Do your own DD. I’m just a guy on Reddit. PS: Any healthcare professionals or physicians here who use Counterpart Health (Clover AI)? I’d really appreciate hearing your feedback or experience.

It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care improving outcomes directly . The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time . 4 . Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast which is rare in Medicare Advantage . Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏 . 5 . Insiders collectively own 21 % of the company . This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management ’ s incentives with shareholders . The biggest insider buy was by CoFounder Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli who purchased approximatelyy $ 1M in shares at $ 2.24 each . Market Confidence is back . Note Not_financial advice .

      "selftext": "Watching RIME today, it feels less like a one-off spike and more like the early phase of price discovery. The stock is up over 20% around $1.23, volume is above 1.2M shares, turnover is near 46%, and the day range has expanded beyond 30% (source type: live market data). Those are not normal conditions for a quiet penny stock. Price discovery phases usually come when new information forces participants to reassess assumptions. Over the past two weeks, RIME has delivered a steady flow of concrete updates: SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M, $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts, and multiple major contract expansions including the Apollo Tyres announcement on Jan 6, 2026 (source type: company press releases). I am not trying to predict where this settles. I am watching how the market digests information now that liquidity and attention are both elevated. When you think a stock has entered price discovery mode, do you focus more on intraday structure or on how it behaves over the next few sessions? Do your own digging.",

      "selftext": "I'm curious about everyone's take on Apple Inc. (AAPL). I've been waiting for a chance to buy the dip, targeting around $200. The question is: Is this expectation realistic? Or am I fixated on a price that may never materialize? On one hand: Compared to Apple's own historical valuations, current levels aren't cheap Growth has slowed significantly compared to the pandemic period When the broader market corrects, tech giants often can't escape declines On the other hand: It is Apple after all， massive buybacks, incredible cash flow, sticky ecosystem Every pullback gets bought up faster than expected Waiting for the “perfect” price has caused many to miss opportunities Thus I face a dilemma: Maintain patience and risk never buying in Or start accumulating positions incrementally, abandoning the quest for the exact bottom For investors holding or considering adding to positions: Do you believe $200 is a realistic possibility, or merely wishful thinking unless the market corrects significantly? Curious how everyone is managing AAPL， fully invested, building positions gradually, or still watching from the sidelines?",

      "selftext": "On Airforce One, Trump said \"we will talk about Greenland in 2 months\" after being asked by a reporter about his intentions there. (I asked the same question here about Venezuela 2 months ago and got deleted by the mods. I hope this time they won't.) So, assuming the US would land on Greenland and try to annex it, what would happen to global markets and stocks? My speculation: Since NATO would basically be canceled, European countries would immediately start to arm up, heavily. They already started to prop up their military a bit, but I think this event will make them go full on militarization, and of course they would buy European. They would also seek to replace existing US equipment. So European defense stocks is the most obvious play here. I can also imagine economic sanctions / tariffs hiked up on the US. That's mainly LNG, oil, pharmaceuticals, machinery, aircrafts. Oil companies, Boeing, Caterpillar, GE and similar stocks will be hit hard. Pharmaceuticals like Pfizer or Eli Lilly will be spared in the short-run but Europe will heavily invest to become independent from the US as well, which could be good for Novartis, Roche, Sanofi, Biontech, Bayer, FMC and the like. In the same vein, Europe will seek to become less dependent on US software / tech and AI. Since European governments will seek fast progress, they will likely rely on successfull incumbents with the necessary talent and infrastructure, like SAP, Atos, Dassault, Siemens, Amadeus and the like. What would you add to the list and how would you position for such an event?",

The company only estimates Annual Net Profit of around $629 Million. The problem is NOBODY in the car business operates at anywhere near the margins CVNA claims to be operating. Autonation, CARMAX, Lithia- The largest and most efficient operators in the car business are not even close to the level of profitability CVNA claims. There is a small chance Carvana insiders ARE NOT using their outsized stock sale gains to fluff the financial reports. But the more I review the financials the less likely that seems",

Over the past few years I was glued to the screen trading nonstop and ended up neglecting family, so I deliberately stepped away to reset and spend more time with them. Now that 2026 is here, I’m starting to rebuild my portfolio. I’m looking at names like ASTS, RKLB, MU, SMCI, and GRAB as longer-term value plays, while also considering some higher-growth bets like SLS and VG. Curious what everyone else is watching going into 2026? Wishing everyone a year where our portfolios make it to the moon🙏🏻",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

Hyundai unveiled the production version of ‍the Atlas humanoid robot, ‍developed by its ‍unit Boston Dynamics, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The company did not disclose the volume or cost of the robots, but said in a ‌statement ‌it aims to roll out adoption across all ​of its manufacturing sites as part of a push into “physical AI”. The robots will initially carry out parts sequencing tasks from 2028, with applications expanding gradually as safety and quality benefits ⁠are validated, it said. By 2030, Hyundai said Atlas robots were expected to move into component assembly with a longer-term plan to take on tasks involving heavy loads, repetitive motions and complex operations across production sites. The robots are designed to reduce physical strain on workers by taking on higher-risk and repetitive tasks, laying the groundwork for broader commercial use in industrial settings, it said. At Hyundai Motor’s affiliate Kia Corp, the labor union last year called to establish a body to address potential labour rights issues in preparation for the AI era, as workers raised concerns about expanding automation. The company expects humanoid robots to become the ‍largest segment of the physical artificial intelligence market, which refers to AI systems ‌embedded in hardware that collect real-world data and make ⁠autonomous decisions, spanning areas such as robotics, smart factories and autonomous driving. Atlas features human-scale hands with tactile sensing and has the ‍ability to lift up to 50 kg (110 pounds), according to Hyundai. The robot can operate autonomously and is designed to function in industrial environments ranging from minus 20 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius. Hyundai said it is accelerating development in this area through partnerships with global AI leaders, ⁠including a collaboration with Nvidia and Google, ‌aimed at improving safety, efficiency and real-world deployment.

I’ve saved around €2,000 and after reading through this sub and researching, my goal is to mostly hold index etfs and let compounding do its thing. I was thinking of starting with something like 80% in index etfs and 20% in stocks/ silver gold (to gain some experience and practice, i wont die losing this money) but im stuck on a few things firstly, im an EU resident and while everyones praising VOO, the europan alternative VUAA has only went up 3% over the past year so would it still be a good choice long term? then i was thinking of some global etf to diversify. if u could reccomend me any specific etfs/ stocks i would be thankful to sum up does this kind of setup make sense? would you change anything? which stocks would u reccomend for the buggest compounding since i domt plan on touching the money (in etfs) for a long time only adding more monthly/ bimonthly based on my situation. Thanks a lot for any advice also im scared since people say the markets very high right now is that okay?",

I ’ ve saved around €2000 and after reading through this sub and researching my goal is to mostly hold index etfs and let compounding do its thing . I was thinking of starting with something like 80 % in index etfs and 20 % in stocks silver gold to gain some experience and practice i wont die losing this money but im stuck on a few things firstly im an EU resident and while everyones praising VOO the europan alternative VUAA has only went up 3 % over the past year so would it still be a good choice long term then i was thinking of some global etf to diversify . if u could reccomend me any specific etfs stocks i would be thankful to sum up does this kind of setup make sense would you change anything which stocks would u reccomend for the buggest compounding since i domt plan on touching the money in etfs for a long time only adding more monthly bimonthly based on my situation . Thanks a lot for any advice also im scared since people say the markets very high right now is that okay"

Novo Nordisk (**NVO**) has seen a significant boost in its stock over the last few trading days (in 5 days **11%**), primarily driven by the official U.S. launch of the **Wegovy Pill**. While NVO climbed, **Eli Lilly (LLY)** fell **3.6%** and **Viking Therapeutics (VKTX)** dropped over **8%.** Disclaimer: Bought NVO shares at the end of 2025.",

I made money off of **$ONDS** today but I've started rethinking the choice within the industry. I'm starting to do research between these four unprofitable companies at the moment: **$AVAV** \\- By far the most established and closest to turning profitable, high Inst Ownership, all for less room to grow. Also high Insider Ownership however. Zero hype. **$ONDS** \\- Contender for worst financials in my opinion, by far the highest hype value. Very low Insider and Inst Ownership.

      "title": "Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI platform at CES 2026, claims 4x fewer GPUs needed vs Blackwell and 10x lower inference token costs",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."

      "selftext": "Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who, like me, find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself it's not the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about. Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount you're willing to lose and I get that, but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent. I wasn't much of a trader, had it all in VTI/VONG/SCHD for about 3 years which was going swimmingly. No idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 7-10% drop. There was some \"logic\" to it but it was definitely an emotional/panic sell. I wasn't afraid of *losing* X amount, or that it wouldn't rebound. BUT, I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could #TimeTheMarket (sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later). What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $242, the literal bottom lmao, then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing really seemed to happen (made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime). *Then*, the tariff pause tweet. Inside of like 2min I lost 10% of my portfolio to SQQQ (who tf was buying my SQQQ mid-spike by the way?) and was basically down something like -24% of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded. Sick to my stomach for days, for weeks. Awful feeling, and I know some of you know it too. I'm mid 30's with a family and we're not talking about just a couple grand. Bought back in with VTI $267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Google's big drop and a few small gambles on Planet Labs/Lantronix/DUOT that I got super lucky with. Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the S&P500 by like 28% at one point to only behind by like 8% now. But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market... Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading. Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes: 1. Those of you getting really lucky remember that, like trust, a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you aren't careful. Or... 2. Those of you that have lost a lot on options/panic selling/etc. know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process. But in the inverse of #1, it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one, let alone a couple bad ones (please don't double down on reckless unless it's money you're willing to lose). \\------------------------- **TLDR**: Convinced myself I wasn't panic selling April 7th but the reality is the same, held SQQQ during tariff pause, through a ton of time and stress back close to market % but don't recommend. Bogleheads might be onto something...",

      "selftext_processed": "Just a very quick cautionary tale for those many of you who like me find themselves frequently trying to time the market but you convince yourself its not_the same reckless timing the market you keep reading about . Some of you are legit day trading or just playing around with a small amount youre willing to lose and I get that but I know a few of us try to time volatility to a lesser extent . I wasnt much of a trader had it all in VTIVONGSCHD for about 3 years which was going swimmingly . No_idea what came over me but April 7th I thought we were in for at least another 710 % drop . There was some logic to it but it was definitely an emotionalpanic sell . I wasnt afraid of losing X amount or that it wouldnt rebound . BUT I believed that it was going to keep sliding for a bit so I thought I could Time The Market sell before the bottom then buy back in like a month later . What ended up happening was I sold VTI at $ 242 the literal bottom lmao then played with SQQQ for a few days while nothing_really seemed to happen made a couple hundred dollars in the meantime . Then the tariff pause tweet . Inside of like 2min I lost 10 % of my portfolio to SQQQ who tf was buying my SQQQ midspike by the way and was basically down something like 24 % of my portfolio and the market had just rebounded . Sick to my stomach for days for weeks . Awful feeling and I know some of you know it too . Im mid 30s with a family and were not_talking about just a couple grand . Bought back in with VTI $ 267 and then pounced on a couple opps like Googles big drop and a few small gambles on Planet LabsLantronixDUOT that I got super lucky with . Those and a bull market have brought me from behind the SP500 by like 28 % at one point to only behind by like 8 % now . But oh my gosh so much time and stress just to get within spitting distance of the market ... Just kind of word vomiting so thanks for reading . Honestly sharing my experience in the hopes 1 . Those of you getting really lucky remember that like trust a portfolio built through dozens of good moves can be broken by one bad one if you arent careful . Or ... 2 . Those of you that have lost a lot on optionspanic sellingetc . know you can climb out of the hole if you reflect on what went wrong in your process . But in the inverse of 1 it takes a lot of good decisions to make up for the one bad one let alone a couple bad ones please dont double down on reckless unless its money youre willing to lose . TLDR Convinced myself I wasnt panic selling April 7th but the reality is the same held SQQQ during tariff pause through a ton of time and stress back close to market % but dont recommend . Bogleheads might be onto something ..."

      "title": "What are the significant announcements made today by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at CES 2026",
      "selftext": "There was a lot of information provided to us during the keynote speech by Jensen Huang. At CES 2026, NVIDIA unveiled its most ambitious AI roadmap yet, headlined by the Rubin platform, a six-chip, extreme-codesigned AI system, and a suite of open models spanning healthcare, robotics, and autonomous driving. The company also showcased its vision for “physical AI” with real-world applications in vehicles, robots, and manufacturing. Rubin is NVIDIA’s first co-designed, six-chip AI platform which succeeds the Blackwell architecture. Rubin GPUs produce 50 petaflops of NVFP4 inference. Vera CPUs are optimized for data movement and agentic processing. NVLink 6 and Spectrum-X provide High-speed networking. ConnectX-9 SuperNICs and BlueField-4 DPUs for data center acceleration. Inference Context Memory Storage is a new AI-native KV-cache tier offering 5x better performance per dollar and power efficiency. This combined architecture delivers AI tokens at 1/10th the cost and accelerate time-to-market for frontier models. NVIDIA emphasized its commitment to open, frontier AI models trained on its supercomputers across six domains: 1. Healthcare (Clara platform) for medical imaging, diagnostics. 2. Climate (Earth-2) for climate modeling and forecasting. 3. Reasoning (Nemotron) for multimodal and logical reasoning. 4. Robotics (Cosmos) for simulation and embodied AI. 5. Embodied AI (GR00T) for physical interaction and learning. 6. Autonomy (Alpamayo) for autonomous driving (Level 4-ready) These models are open-source, enabling global collaboration and deployment. Autonomous Driving with Alpamayo & Mercedes-Benz CLA Alpamayo R1 is the first open reasoning Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model for AVs. AlpaSim is an open simulation blueprint for high-fidelity AV testing. Mercedes-Benz CLA is the first production car with Alpamayo, launching in the U.S. in 2026. DRIVE Hyperion is NVIDIA’s modular, Level 4-ready AV platform which continues gaining traction with automakers and robotaxi firms. DGX Spark & Personal Agents for AI on every desk. DGX Spark is a desktop AI supercomputer with up to 2.6x performance for large models that supports local AI agents using Hugging Face models through a robot called Reachy Mini. There will be new support for Lightricks LTX-12 and FLUX image models and NVIDIA AI Enterprise is coming to DGX Spark for broader deployment. From Simulation to Real-World Robotics with Physical AI NVIDIA Cosmos trains robots using video, simulation, and real-world data and is capable of generating realistic videos from single images, modeling edge-case driving scenarios, and performing physical reasoning and trajectory prediction. Isaac Sim & Isaac Lab are used to train robots in photorealistic virtual environments. There was also a partnership announced with Siemens that expands collaboration to integrate NVIDIA’s stack into industrial automation and digital twins. NVIDIA now builds entire AI systems, from chips to software, to eliminate bottlenecks and accelerate innovation through open models. CEO Jensen Huang said, “Our job is to create the entire stack so that all of you can create incredible applications for the rest of the world.”",

      "selftext": "Just my 2 cents after watching Jensen at CES. This didn’t feel like a simple “faster GPU” update. More like NVDA quietly setting up **what comes** ***after*** **Blackwell**. Rubin being a *full platform* (chip + networking + system) stood out to me. That’s how they keep everyone locked into the ecosystem, not just selling cards. Also interesting that Jensen said next-gen stuff is **already in production**. In AI, whoever ships first usually wins the orders. Yeah, valuation isn’t cheap no argument there. But NVDA doesn’t really trade on “cheap,” it trades on **who controls the stack**. I’m still holding a core position and trading around it. Curious how others are playing this adding here or just waiting?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some guidance and opinions. I’m a 47 year old small business owner in Pennsylvania. I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025. He’s now 1.5 years old, and I plan to contribute roughly $10,000 per year going forward. I automatically put $100 in each week plus Christmas/birthday money goes in I’ve been trying to do my due diligence, but honestly there’s so much information out there that I’m getting confused, and I’m not confident I’m approaching this the right way. So far he has 6 shares of NVDA, 59 shares of FSELX, 29 shares of FSPGX, 300 shares of HGRAF & 22 shares of KGC. This is meant to be a long-term growth account (college, early adulthood, etc.). I’m open to a “set and forget” approach if that’s the smartest move. I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly second-guessing myself. Should I just VOO or VTI and chill? Thanks in advance! I really appreciate the help!",

Haven’t seen this datapoint before, I find it quite staggering. After this quote goes on to mention market cap-to-GDP, price-to-book, and enterprise value-to-sales. \\> As a result, it’s more about hunting selective opportunities, particularly in health care and real estate. \\> The case for health care and real estate in a fully priced market Subramanian argues that health care and real estate are two sectors that look cheaper than tech, and the numbers are moving in the right direction. Having assigned an overweight rating on both with a nearly one-year time frame, she suggests the appeal isn’t just about low valuations, but about improving fundamentals. I find this stance kind of strange, is this normal for BoA to do? I feel that it causes the article to lose the credibility it had accumulated, at least for me.

Haven ’ t seen this datapoint before I find it quite staggering . After this quote goes on to mention market captoGDP pricetobook and enterprise valuetosales . As a result it ’ s more about hunting selective opportunities particularly in health care and real estate . The case for health care and real estate in a fully priced market Subramanian argues that health care and real estate are two sectors that look cheaper than tech and the numbers are moving in the right direction . Having assigned an overweight rating on both with a nearly oneyear time frame she suggests the appeal isn ’ t just about low valuations but about improving fundamentals . I find this stance kind of strange is this normal for BoA to do I feel that it causes the article to lose the credibility it had accumulated at least for me . What do those with more knowledgeexperience than me think about this"

      "selftext": "So just to give some context I am an 18 year old college freshman and started my own bank accounts late November 2025. Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi (High APY+ I love their UI). I have a part time job where I make minimum wage, so I'm not exactly talking about significant amounts of money, just a few thousands. I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $60 a month + whatever I spent on food or entertainment. I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not fully understanding my own investment goals yet. Right now the main thing I'd like to save/invest for is my first car, as well as money for travel because I love to travel and I'd like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth. Longer term, I wouldn't mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me. More specifically, I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground. As well, (sorry I keep adding stuff) I'm in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years. So I guess my horizon would be in the 5-10 year range but I also wouldn't mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life. So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4% APY with Sofi because of the 0.7% boost to new Sofi+ subscribers (eligible deposit). I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however, with a good portion of it (around 60%) in VOO. I also have NVDA, IREN (I hope the bubble doesn't burst), and TTWO (GTA 6 lol). As well, I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there (1/5 the amount of self-investment) is it worth it to even continue that one? It currently has a 0.25% advisory fee and I'm getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one. It's on moderately aggressive and I've been debating setting it to aggressive. Right now I just kind of feel like I don't know what I'm doing I see a lot of people online saying \"VOO and chill\" but I'm just wondering whether that's the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year. I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say \"that looks good!\" lmao. But seriously I just don't know if I'm doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or I'm not sure what. I'd say my risk tolerance is pretty good, I don't get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens. But still, I think I might have diamond hands haha. Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now I've seen videos that it's kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD. Along those lines, would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American S&P 500? I know the US market won't crumble overnight or anything I'm just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETF's and stocks. Also, I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income? Any help is greatly appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "So just to give some context I am an 18 year old college freshman and started my own bank accounts late November 2025 . Currently I have my checking account with Capital One and I do both my savings as well as investing with Sofi High APY I love their UI . I have a part time job where I make minimum wage so Im not_exactly talking about significant amounts of money just a few thousands . I live with my parents still so my only expenses turn out to about $ 60 a month whatever I spent on food or entertainment . I think I just feel a little lost especially hearing from different sources across the web as well as not_fully understanding my own investment goals yet . Right now the main thing Id like to saveinvest for is my first car as well as money for travel because I love to travel and Id like to see as much of the world as possible while I have my youth . Longer term I wouldnt mind having that safety net which long term investment could provide for me . More specifically I also might use some savings sometime down the line to help finance a short film project since I am a film major and early on self financing is one of the only ways really you can get your stuff off the ground . As well sorry I keep adding stuff Im in community college right now and may transfer so it would be nice to have some money to help my parents out in case I do in a few years . So I guess my horizon would be in the 510 year range but I also wouldnt mind holding for decades to see that return later on in life . So I have most of my money in savings right now where I currently have a 4 % APY with Sofi because of the 0.7 % boost to new Sofi subscribers eligible deposit . I have a decent amount of my money in stocks however with a good portion of it around 60 % in VOO . I also have NVDA IREN I hope the bubble doesnt burst and TTWO GTA 6 lol . As well I also started off with one of those Robo invest accounts Sofi has but I have a lot less money in there 15 the amount of selfinvestment is it worth it to even continue that one It currently has a 0.25 % advisory fee and Im getting modest ROI though a bit lower than the self directed one . Its on moderately aggressive and Ive been debating setting it to aggressive . Right now I just kind of feel like I dont know what Im doing I see a lot of people online saying VOO and chill but Im just wondering whether thats the best option specifically considering my horizon such as wanting a car by this year . I just kind of look at the funny line that goes up and down and say that looks good lmao . But seriously I just dont know if Im doing this right and whether I should diversify more or go for riskier stocks or Im not_sure what . Id say my risk tolerance is pretty good I dont get super scared when I see a slight downturn but of course I feel a bit of a twinge of panic when that happens . But still I think I might have diamond hands haha . Also a few things I was wondering about would it be good to buy Gold right now Ive seen videos that its kind of skyrocketing due to increased mistrust in USD . Along those lines would it be smart to continue buying VOO as it only represents American SP 500 I know the US market wont crumble overnight or anything Im just wondering if it would be smart to look into international ETFs and stocks . Also I find dividends slightly interesting is it worth looking at dividends and dividend investing for some passive income Any help is greatly appreciated ."

It's to the point where, if you aren't making a decent amount you genuinely getting scammed or the universe hates you. It really can't be that hard yo 😮‍💨 and I'm not gonna lie, some of you just be choosing to fail (not failing as in going to negatives, but as in not making a decent amount), it actually feels illegal for me to investing like this.

      "title": "Microsoft’s Nadella wants us to stop thinking of AI as ‘slop’",
      "selftext": "A few weeks after Merriam-Webster named “slop” its Word of the Year, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the future of AI in 2026. In his signature intellectual style on his personal blog, Nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of AI as “garbage” and start seeing it as a “bicycle for the mind.” He wrote, “A new concept that develops the ‘bicycle for the mind’ into a tool for progress, encouraging us to always see AI as a scaffold for human potential, not a replacement.” He went on: “We need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined, and build a new balance in our ‘theory of mind’ to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another.” If you parse his words carefully, it’s clear that he’s not just urging people to stop dismissing AI-generated content as garbage he’s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating AI as a replacement for humans. He wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work. But there’s a problem with this framework: the marketing of AI agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable. Meanwhile, some AI leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment. For example, in May of this year, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could replace half of entry-level white-collar jobs and push the unemployment rate to 10–20% within five years. Last month, he reiterated this warning in an interview on *60 Minutes*. However, the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear. As Nadella implied, most AI tools today do not replace workers they are used by workers (as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of AI’s work). MIT’s ongoing Project Iceberg is often cited in studies measuring AI’s economic impact on the workforce. The project estimates that AI is currently capable of performing roughly 11.7% of paid human labor. While many reports suggest AI could replace nearly 12% of jobs, the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to AI. Then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks. Examples include automating nurses’ paperwork and AI-generated computer code. This doesn’t mean AI has seriously impacted every job. According to an article on Substack called *Blood in the Machine*, corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples. Similarly, unemployment remains high for entry-level programmers fresh out of college. Yet it’s undeniable that skilled artists, writers, and programmers using AI tools produce work that’s often superior to those without these skills. AI still cannot replace human creativity. As we move into 2026, some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with AI are actually thriving not surprisingly. A report from Vanguard Group forecasting the 2026 economy found that “roughly 100 of the occupations most susceptible to AI automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth.” The report concludes that those who know how to use AI effectively are making themselves more valuable, not more replaceable. Ironically, Microsoft’s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that “AI will steal our jobs.” The company laid off over 15,000 employees in 2025, despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year (ending in June), which it credited to AI success. Nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement. Notably, he did not say that internal AI efficiency improvements caused the layoffs. But he did say Microsoft needed to “reimagine our mission in the new era” and listed “AI transformation” as one of three core business priorities in this era (the other two being security and quality). The truth about AI-driven unemployment in 2025 is far more complex. As the Vanguard report notes, it’s less about AI efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slow-growth areas in favor of fast-growing ones. Fairly speaking, Microsoft is not the only company developing AI while laying off staff. According to CNBC, research from Challenger, Gray & Christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly 55,000 U.S. workers by 2025. The report also notes that Amazon, Salesforce, Microsoft, and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year, even as they actively developed AI. To be fair, those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and AI generated short videos might think that “garbage” is one of the most entertaining uses of AI even if not the best.",

      "selftext_processed": "A few weeks after MerriamWebster named “ slop ” its Word of the Year Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella shared his thoughts on the future of AI in 2026 . In his signature intellectual style on his personal blog Nadella wrote that he hopes we stop thinking of AI as “ garbage ” and start seeing it as a “ bicycle for the mind. ” He wrote “ A new concept that develops the ‘ bicycle for the mind ’ into a tool for progress encouraging us to always see AI as a scaffold for human potential not_a replacement. ” He went on “ We need to move beyond the debate between rough and refined and build a new balance in our ‘ theory of mind ’ to explain how humans are equipped with these new cognitive enhancement tools in their interactions with one another. ” If you parse his words carefully it ’ s clear that he ’ s not_just urging people to stop dismissing AIgenerated content as garbage he ’ s also hoping the tech industry will stop treating AI as a replacement for humans . He wants the industry to begin seeing it as a productivity tool that augments human work . But there ’ s a problem with this framework the marketing of AI agents largely relies on the idea of replacing human labor to justify pricing and make costs seem reasonable . Meanwhile some AI leaders have issued warnings that the technology could soon drive very high unemployment . For example in May of this year Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that AI could replace half of entrylevel whitecollar jobs and push the unemployment rate to 10–20 % within five years . Last month he reiterated this warning in an interview on 60 Minutes . However the reality of these doomsday predictions remains unclear . As Nadella implied most AI tools today do not_replace workers they are used by workers as long as humans are willing to check the accuracy of AI ’ s work . MIT ’ s ongoing Project Iceberg is often cited in studies measuring AI ’ s economic impact on the workforce . The project estimates that AI is currently capable of performing roughly 11.7 % of paid human labor . While many reports suggest AI could replace nearly 12 % of jobs the project clarifies that its estimate refers to how much work could potentially be outsourced to AI . Then it calculates the wages associated with those outsourced tasks . Examples include automating nurses ’ paperwork and AIgenerated computer code . This doesn ’ t mean AI has seriously impacted every job . According to an article on Substack called Blood in the Machine corporate graphic designers and marketing bloggers are two examples . Similarly unemployment remains high for entrylevel programmers fresh out of college . Yet it ’ s undeniable that skilled artists writers and programmers using AI tools produce work that ’ s often superior to those without these skills . AI still can not replace human creativity . As we move into 2026 some data suggest that the professions making the greatest progress with AI are actually thriving not_surprisingly . A report from Vanguard Group forecasting the 2026 economy found that “ roughly 100 of the occupations most susceptible to AI automation are outperforming the rest of the labor market in terms of employment growth and real wage growth. ” The report concludes that those who know how to use AI effectively are making themselves more valuable not_more replaceable . Ironically Microsoft ’ s moves last year may have fueled the narrative that “ AI will steal our jobs. ” The company laid off over 15000 employees in 2025 despite record high revenue and profit in the previous fiscal year ending in June which it credited to AI success . Nadella even wrote a public memo on the layoffs after the earnings announcement . Notably he did not_say that internal AI efficiency improvements caused the layoffs . But he did say Microsoft needed to “ reimagine our mission in the new era ” and listed “ AI transformation ” as one of three core business priorities in this era the other two being security and quality . The truth about AIdriven unemployment in 2025 is far more complex . As the Vanguard report notes it ’ s less about AI efficiency and more about conventional business decisions that may be less attractive to investors like halting investment in slowgrowth areas in favor of fastgrowing ones . Fairly speaking Microsoft is not_the only company developing AI while laying off staff . According to CNBC research from Challenger Gray Christmas shows that this technology is expected to have displaced nearly 55000 U.S. workers by 2025 . The report also notes that Amazon Salesforce Microsoft and other tech firms conducted large scale layoffs last year even as they actively developed AI . To be fair those of us who spend too much time on social media watching memes and AI generated short videos might think that “ garbage ” is one of the most entertaining uses of AI even if not_the best ."

I recently started investing $3k per month into VOO, but only have about $30k in it so far - so my cash/treasury allocation is still very high. I’ve been feeling a bit discouraged because I missed much of the recent gains in VOO. What would you recommend I do in this situation? Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! Edit: As suggested, for my brokerage account I plan to invest $100k into VOO right away, and then DCA $10k per month into VOO until my stock allocation reaches about 50%. For my retirement accounts, I plan to move $60k into VOO now, and then DCA $10k per month until fully transition the rest of funds into VOO. Edit: Finally invested today! On my brokerage account: Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares in the amount of $100,000.00, invested 20% On my IRA account: Buy $50,281.08 of NVDA at Market (Day) Filled at $187.855, invested 50% On my Roth account: Buy $19,842.82 of NVDA at Market (Day) Filled at $188.20, invested 100% On my 401k account: Already invested $30k in VOO, continue max 401k this year Projected 2026 contributions $27,799: Myself: $24,499 / Employer: $3,300 DCA 10k into VOO bi-weekly twice a month.

      "selftext_processed": "Hello everyone I am a male in my early 30s . I currently have about $ 500k in SGOV in a brokerage account . I recently started investing $ 3k per month into VOO but only have about $ 30k in it so far so my cashtreasury allocation is still very high . I ’ ve been feeling a bit discouraged because I missed much of the recent gains in VOO . What would you recommend I do in this situation Any advice would be appreciated . Thanks Edit As suggested for my brokerage account I plan to invest $ 100k into VOO right away and then DCA $ 10k per month into VOO until my stock allocation reaches about 50 % . For my retirement accounts I plan to move $ 60k into VOO now and then DCA $ 10k per month until fully transition the rest of funds into VOO . Edit Finally invested today On my brokerage account Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares in the amount of $ 100000.00 invested 20 % On my IRA account Buy $ 50281.08 of NVDA at Market Day Filled at $ 187.855 invested 50 % On my Roth account Buy $ 19842.82 of NVDA at Market Day Filled at $ 188.20 invested 100 % On my 401k account Already invested $ 30k in VOO continue max 401k this year Projected 2026 contributions $ 27799 Myself $ 24499 Employer $ 3300 DCA 10k into VOO biweekly twice a month . Solowork for $ 1000 extra cash flow each month to make up my expense . Hopefully I can gradually catch up"

      "selftext": "I am relatively new to working on a strategy that is not more safe and secure investing. I am not a numbers guy so I do not think I will ever become smarter than a hedge fund manager or be able to recognize things that are not market manipulations like pump and dumps. I have a healthcare background so can understand some science. For the last year Ive been reading science related news and even subscribed to the journal Nature. Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments. Like these newly published studies sometimes do not even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable. Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies. I am not saying I will find the next Nvidia easily but it was figured out gpus could be used for AI years before Chatgpt triggered the AI bubble. One of my first moves was to invest in the company Sana Biotechnology which had a successful development of a cell that produced insulin in one patient that did not trigger an autoimmune response. The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far. I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not traditional. I can afford to lose money speculating and honestly I find it interesting learning what I have been learning so it has become a hobby almost. I do not want to go so far as to gamble on options. So this seems like a good niche for me to learn new science trends before they become popular and profitable.",

I am not_a numbers guy so I do not_think I will ever become smarter than a hedge fund manager or be able to recognize things that are not_market manipulations like pump and dumps . I have a healthcare background so can understand some science . For the last year Ive been reading science related news and even subscribed to the journal Nature . Which is a great source for new science but I need to develop a disciplined approach to follow up with periodically looking for new companies and investments . Like these newly published studies sometimes do not_even have venture capital lined up or google search results I could follow up on to look for new companies trying to become profitable . Which I assume is when some of you guys start paying attention to companies . I am not_saying I will find the next Nvidia easily but it was figured out gpus could be used for AI years before Chatgpt triggered the AI bubble . One of my first moves was to invest in the company Sana Biotechnology which had a successful development of a cell that produced insulin in one patient that did not_trigger an autoimmune response . The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far . I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not_traditional . I can afford to lose money speculating and honestly I find it interesting learning what I have been learning so it has become a hobby almost . I do not_want to go so far as to gamble on options . So this seems like a good niche for me to learn new science trends before they become popular and profitable ."

      "selftext": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium & Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this: Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing. Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way. ￼ This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security. ￼ You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real. ￼ All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes. ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed. That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress. Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up. Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

      "selftext_processed": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security specifically to Uranium Rare Earths . I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days . Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand . Check this Uranium isn ’ t ripping because of headlines . It ’ s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action . For years the narrative was “ renewables can do it ” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible . That was suppression . Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression . Inventories got drained . Mines stayed closed . Licensing stayed slow . Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing . Now you ’ re seeing the change . Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing deployment and implementation of nuclear energy policies . That hearing isn ’ t symbolic it ’ s strategic . Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can ’ t meet AI and industrial demand any other way . ￼ This isn ’ t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point . This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog . That ’ s the kind of governmentlevel pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security . ￼ You can see markets already moving on this . NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn ’ t just talk congressional heat makes it more real . ￼ All the antinuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue . AI energy demand exposed the grid ’ s limitations and the same committee that has talked about AI ’ s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes . ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression . When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year that signals policy momentum not_posturing . Politicians aren ’ t just parroting soundbites they ’ re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed . That ’ s why uranium is behaving the way it is . This isn ’ t a retail meme rally . This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints . The market was suppressed . Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress . Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it . If they were just talking prices wouldn ’ t care . But this is action . And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up . Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history outside of bitcoin and you all are sleeping .

      "selftext": "The short Version: In Q3 2025 Carvana reported a $331 Million Profit on $1.1 Billion in fixed pool loan sales (Carvana writes loans, bundles them, and sells them to Ally bank and other investors for a profit) The problem is that NOBODY and I mean NOBODY is writing a 30% profit margin on loan sales. There is no conceivable world where Carvana is writing these loans at anything close to a 30% rate or yield. For comparison, a normal bank bundling loans will average 2-3% gross margin, and banks DREAM about 15-20% Net margin. At 30% margin Carvana would be about the MOST PROFITABLE LOAN BUNDLER IN THE WORLD. At a time when lower income and subprime credit consumers (who Carvana aggressively targets) are struggling and delinquency rates are shooting up at LITERALLY EVERY AUTO LOAN ORIGINATOR. WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE FOOLING?? This is direct from Carvana’s 2025 Q3 report: BEGIN QUOTE “Fixed Pool Loan Sales During the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $1.1 billion and $0.4 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties. During the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $3.1 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively, in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties. Gain on Loan Sales The total gain related to finance receivables sold to financing partners and pursuant to securitization transactions was $331 million and $224 million during the three months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $878 million and $541 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, which is included in other sales and revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.” END QUOTE There is virtually no possible scenario SOMEBODY isn’t fluffing these numbers. At a time when every senior officer at CVNA is dumping shares to the tune of millions of $$$. What do THEY know we don’t? Full disclosure. I am not an investment advisor. This is not financial advice. I am a retail trader with current open put positions against Carvana.",

There is no_conceivable world where Carvana is writing these loans at anything close to a 30 % rate or yield . For comparison a normal bank bundling loans will average 23 % gross margin and banks DREAM about 1520 % Net margin . At 30 % margin Carvana would be about the MOST PROFITABLE LOAN BUNDLER IN THE WORLD . At a time when lower income and subprime credit consumers who Carvana aggressively targets are struggling and delinquency rates are shooting up at LITERALLY EVERY AUTO LOAN ORIGINATOR . WHO DO THEY THINK THEY ARE FOOLING This is direct from Carvana ’ s 2025 Q3 report BEGIN QUOTE “ Fixed Pool Loan Sales During the three months ended September 30 2025 and 2024 the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $ 1.1 billion and $ 0.4 billion respectively in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties . During the nine months ended September 30 2025 and 2024 the Company completed fixed pool loan sales of $ 3.1 billion and $ 0.8 billion respectively in principal balances of finance receivables to unrelated third parties . Gain on Loan Sales The total gain related to finance receivables sold to financing partners and pursuant to securitization transactions was $ 331 million and $ 224 million during the three months ended September 30 2025 and 2024 respectively and $ 878 million and $ 541 million during the nine months ended September 30 2025 and 2024 respectively which is included in other sales and revenues in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. ” END QUOTE There is virtually no_possible scenario SOMEBODY isn ’ t fluffing these numbers . At a time when every senior officer at CVNA is dumping shares to the tune of millions of $ $ $ . What do THEY know we don ’ t Full disclosure . I am not_an investment advisor . This is not_financial advice . I am a retail trader with current open put positions against Carvana ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys. For context I'm from Argentina so 120 dollars monthly here is a decent amount of money to invest in stocks. With that being said, I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS (basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos), and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification. While I'm no MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets, investing, options, crypto and other tools, but I played with fire some years ago (LUNA flashbacks) and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together, especially since I lost my job a year ago. I now have a stable good paying job and I can invest around $100-$120 USD monthly ($117,23 this month), and decided to build a rather safe and conservative portfolio consisting off: 35% in SPDR 500, 15% each in VTI and QQQ, 5% each in KO, JNJ, and AAPL, 7% in MSFT, and 6% each in NVDA, AMZN, and META. I did some math and corroborated this info with some help of AI and apparently I would be getting between 5% and 15% returns annually including dividends (can be more if the market goes bullish). Any advise? Any changes I should do? Do you think this portfolio is good? All help will be highly appreciated!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys . For context Im from Argentina so 120 dollars monthly here is a decent amount of money to invest in stocks . With that being said I opened my portfolio through a broker that allows me to access the US market without any fees or restrictions that I would face if I use any CEDEARS basically US stocks mirrored in Argentine pesos and started my tiny portfolio with what I think is a more than decent diversification . While Im no_MBA I do have prior experience in stock markets investing options crypto and other tools but I played with fire some years ago LUNA flashbacks and basically chickened out of crypto and investments all together especially since I lost my job a year ago . I now have a stable good paying job and I can invest around $ 100 $ 120 USD monthly $ 11723 this month and decided to build a rather safe and conservative portfolio consisting off 35 % in SPDR 500 15 % each in VTI and QQQ 5 % each in KO JNJ and AAPL 7 % in MSFT and 6 % each in NVDA AMZN and META . I did some math and corroborated this info with some help of AI and apparently I would be getting between 5 % and 15 % returns annually including dividends can be more if the market goes bullish . Any advise Any changes I should do Do you think this portfolio is good All help will be highly appreciated"

      "selftext": "Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks). It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA). Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs. Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead. I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors? I'm interested mostly in purchasing rather than shorting, but would enjoy takes on both long term and short term gains.",

We think we’re gonna keep her /s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time. From time to time, I’m in the living room with her watching it. It is…a good show tbh. Great dialogue. I digress. In on episode, Lorelai’s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant. $75,000. A great windfall for sure. But it got me thinking-how could I do something similar for my daughter? What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this. I obviously don’t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai. I, after all, am not a Yale alumnus (lowly state school offspring here) and am not known for making the best picks in the market. I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA. Anyways, how could I go about doing this for my daughter? Some sort of brokerage account for children? Thanks in advance.",

We think we ’ re gon na keep her s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time . From time to time I ’ m in the living room with her watching it . It is…a good show tbh . Great dialogue . I digress . In on episode Lorelai ’ s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant . $ 75000 . A great windfall for sure . But it got me thinkinghow could I do something similar for my daughter What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this . I obviously don ’ t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai . I after all am not_a Yale alumnus lowly state school offspring here and am not_known for making the best picks in the market . I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA . Anyways how could I go about doing this for my daughter Some sort of brokerage account for children Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "I’m starting to think it might be time to trim or sell some of my NVDA position. For the fourth trading day in a row, NVIDIA (NVDA) has gapped up at the open, only to sell off or fade during the session. That kind of price action is starting to stand out. To me, it feels like: Strength is getting sold into Buyers are showing up premarket, but conviction fades intraday Short‑term momentum might be getting tired This isn’t a knock on NVDA as a company, the long‑term story is still strong, but from a tactical / price‑action perspective, repeated gap‑and‑fade behavior usually isn’t a great sign in the near term. I’m debating whether this is: Just normal consolidation after a big run Or early signs of distribution before a deeper pullback Curious how others are reading it, holding through the chop, trimming into strength, or waiting for a cleaner setup before adding again?",

Ive used this for the last two years and generated above market returns both years . I generally look for a minimum sum of 40 for revenue growth plus operating margin . Then I divide that by the projected operating multiple . If the result is greater than 2.0 I consider the stock a prospect for more research . Stock Screener Im focused on large caps right now and currently holding NVDA MU GOOGL META MSFT and LLY . There can be plenty of errors in a free stock screener so please do your own research before making any investment decision ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ll start by saying this: I am a believer in the future of D2C technology. The market is clearly there, and Starlink’s recent earnings have proven even the most optimistic bulls right, the demand for global connectivity is massive and highly profitable. However, we need to have a serious talk about ASTS and its management’s ability to actually execute. While I want this company to succeed, their track record in 2025 was, frankly, a masterclass in over-promising and under-delivering. Let’s look at the Promises vs Reality from last year: |**Key Metrics**|**Initial 2025 Promise (Plan)**|**Year-End 2025 Reality (Actual)**|**Completion Rate / Status**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Block 2 Satellite Launch Count**|17 Satellites|1 Satellite|\\~6% (Severe Miss)| |**Commercial Service Launch**|Q4 2025|Delayed to 2026|Missed / Deferred| |**Service Coverage Area**|Nationwide US + Japan|None (Testing Only)|Not Realized| |**Primary Revenue Sources**|Commercial Rev + Gov Contracts|Minimal R&D Revenue|Not Realized| |**Manufacturing Capacity**|4-6 Satellites / Month|Single-digit Ramp-up|Severely Lagging| **So, why am I still here?** Despite the management’s poor execution, I still believe ASTS has a place in the future. The space market is vast enough for both Starlink and ASTS. 1. Anti-Trust & Market Competition: Global regulators and telecom giants (MNOs) have a vested interest in preventing a Starlink monopoly. There is a systemic demand for a viable second provider. 2. Sovereignty & Security: For many nations, relying solely on SpaceX represents a strategic risk. ASTS offers a necessary alternative for data sovereignty. 3. Risk Diversification: The \"Key Man Risk\" associated with Elon Musk encourages partners to seek a more traditional corporate counterparty. ASTS has a \"moat\" not because of its management, but because the world needs it to exist as a counterbalance to SpaceX. My Bottom Line: I’m not selling, but I’m done eating the hopium management is serving. My stance will only change when I see real results (any one of them): * **Operational Leadership Transition: Integrating seasoned aerospace manufacturing executives to fix the production mess.** * **Verifiable Throughput: Meeting the Q1 2026 launch windows without further excuses.** The market is big enough for both Starlink and ASTS. But \"being there\" isn't enough; ASTS must prove it can build its way there. Until then, ASTS remains a brilliant technology trapped in a cycle of management incompetence.",

      "title": "SEZL: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger. # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY. **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. [](",

      "selftext_processed": "It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger . BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile ."

      "selftext": "Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies. With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio. Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX’s long term growth and stock performance?",

      "title": "SEZL is the BEST setup for 2026: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \\~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \\~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger: # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25). Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY. I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger. **ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:** The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** EDIT: position",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Sezzle SEZL is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026 . 15 Forward PE for 2026 w earnings growing 30 % . Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . NOTE the drop in Sezzle ’ s SEZL Q2 2025 TTM Trailing Twelve Month EPS drop is primarily due to a onetime significant tax benefit in Q2 2024 rolling off the twelvemonth calculation . Operating Income actually grew by 116 % yearoveryear from $ 16.7M in Q2 ‘ 24 to $ 36.1M in Q2 ‘ 25 . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile . At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger . ALSO CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . EDIT position"

      "selftext": "Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies. With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio. Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX’s long term growth and stock performance?",

      "selftext_processed": "Phillips 66 PSX has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK . This move is set to bolster their operations especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery . The company has stated that after thorough evaluations it decided not_to restart Lindsay ’ s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints . Instead Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies . With this acquisition Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations . The decision not_to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart . Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66s strong presence in the refining market this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio . Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX ’ s long term growth and stock performance"

      "selftext": "Just saw shipping data showing that an oil tanker, leased by Chevron (CVX), loaded with Venezuelan crude, has just left Venezuelan waters and is headed to the U.S. Gulf Coast. For context, this is significant because the U.S. has had sanctions on Venezuelan oil for years, and any move involving Venezuelan crude is bound to attract some attention, especially in terms of geopolitical risk. While this could be a sign of improved relations or adjustments in the sanctions regime, it also raises questions about the stability of oil supply chains, as well as the market's perception of Chevron's involvement with Venezuela's state-owned PDVSA. The oil market is already volatile, and this move could either help CVX by providing access to cheap crude or complicate their position due to potential political backlash. Any thoughts on how this might affect Chevron's stock in the short and long term? Is this a bullish or bearish development for CVX considering the ongoing sanctions and geopolitical risks?",

      "selftext": "I've been following Opera for a while now. And while I love their products, and generally like the idea of alternatives in the digital space, I can't for the life of me see how it can pay out such a juicy dividend. Opera Limited, together with its subsidiaries, provides mobile and PC web browsers and related products and services in Norway and internationally. The company offers mobile browser products, such as Opera Mini, Opera browser for Android and iOS, and Opera GX for PCs and Mobile; PC browsers, including Opera for Computers and Opera GX; Apex Football; Opera VPN Pro; and Opera News, an AI-powered personalized news discovery and aggregation service. It provides browser-based cashback rewards programs; owns GameMaker Studio, a 2D gaming development platform; and GXC, a gaming portal. In addition, the company operates Opera Ads, an online advertising platform; and offers Web3 and e-commerce services. Opera Limited was founded in 1995 and is headquartered in Oslo, Norway. Opera Limited is a subsidiary of Kunlun Tech Co., Ltd. Their previous trailing payout ratio (12-months) is 45% and their current trailing payout ratio is 89%. Their EPS (TTM) is $0.90 vs the industry average of $9.61. Their PE (TTM) is 15.81 vs the industry average of $42.53. Their PE (5-year average) is 23.17 vs industry average of $57.50. EPS growth (TTM vs prior TTM) is -49.72% vs industry average of +45.05%. And their EPS growth (last qtr vs same qtr prior year) is +5.00% vs industry average of +16.13%. And lastly, their financial statements from Q3 (Sep-30-2025) Balance sheet (USD MM) Total assets 1,060 Total liabilities 112 Debt to assets 10.6% Income statement (USD MM) Net sales 152 Gross profit 69 Profit margin 45.66% Cash flow (USD MM) Operating 78 Net cash flow (9) I guess looking at these last numbers, the company is solid financially. But they'd benefit more from internal R&D, wouldn't they? I've been with them for 2024. A small 1% international/technology ADR portfolio play. Down about 5%. Many thanks.",

      "selftext": "2025 was a very fruitful year for me. All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, the return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some friends in the investment community, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO. Although there were some fluctuations, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become new growth points next year. There is a good chance that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia. I am still closely monitoring the situation and waiting for the right opportunity.",

On Jan 3, 2026, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. (already a ~10% owner) reported an open-market purchase of: • 672,734 shares • Avg price: $70.11 • About $47M deployed Now What makes this interesting is that it’s not any single transaction. This is the third buying in few weeks. The first was around $42.5M And then around $62M and now another $47M All from the same buyer in open market. So, what do you think they know?",

      "selftext": "One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias. A lot of SemiCab's traction has been in India, and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand. I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like \"nice, but does it work in the U.S.?\" even when the economics are already meaningful. The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release). Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). If that run-rate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography, the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex. Do your own research.",

A lot of SemiCabs traction has been in India and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand . I see this all the time with microcaps international wins get treated like nice but does it work in the U.S. even when the economics are already meaningful . The Dec 22 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss . The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100 % to 600 % source type company press release . The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $ 6M described as the largest in SemiCab history and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183 . The release also notes Asian Paints has over $ 4B in annual sales which gives context on customer size source type company press release . Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220 % from $ 2.5M in January to over $ 8M by December and cited a forwardlooking ARR of $ 15M based on current contracts and expansions source type company press release . If that runrate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex . Do your own research ."

All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing the best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and emerging as the ultimate winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, your return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some investment friends, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO shares. Although there were some ups and downs, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. Recently, I learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is growing larger, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become the new growth areas in the coming year. It's highly possible that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia. I am still closely monitoring the situation, waiting for the right opportunity.",

      "selftext": "Markets are starting 2026 on an interesting note. Global equities are generally higher, with European stocks hitting record levels and defense, tech, and cyclical names all contributing to gains. Around the world, Asian markets like the Nikkei and Kospi are also climbing, with AI and chip related sectors in focus. AI enthusiasm remains alive, but there’s also a growing narrative around AI‑driven inflation risk as massive spending on infrastructure could keep pressure on prices and force central banks to rethink rate paths. Geopolitical headlines are adding to the backdrop too, markets aren’t panicking, but safe‑haven assets like gold and silver are up, and investors are balancing optimism with caution. Given these mixed signals, broad equity strength but rising inflation fears and lingering geopolitics. It feels like markets are trying to find a clear narrative for this year. Are we looking at sustained 2026 gains, or is this early strength masking lurking volatility once liquidity fully returns? What are you watching most closely right now? Sector rotations, macro data, or geopolitical risk?",

Global equities are generally higher with European stocks hitting record levels and defense tech and cyclical names all contributing to gains . Around the world Asian markets like the Nikkei and Kospi are also climbing with AI and chip related sectors in focus . AI enthusiasm remains alive but there ’ s also a growing narrative around AI‑driven inflation risk as massive spending on infrastructure could keep pressure on prices and force central banks to rethink rate paths . Geopolitical headlines are adding to the backdrop too markets aren ’ t panicking but safe‑haven assets like gold and silver are up and investors are balancing optimism with caution . Given these mixed signals broad equity strength but rising inflation fears and lingering geopolitics . It feels like markets are trying to find a clear narrative for this year . Are we looking at sustained 2026 gains or is this early strength masking lurking volatility once liquidity fully returns What are you watching most closely right now Sector rotations macro data or geopolitical risk"

Ended up being lucky timing and have not even for 1 day dipped below principle but kept adding and maxed out around November and got $500 in this year. Due to later contributions I’m only up about 10% so the next bear market would still easily take me below principle. Not like it really matters in the long run but feels like a milestone to me. A good 5ish years would do it for 1 lump sum investment but with new contributions it would be a lot longer.

Ended up being lucky timing and have not_even for 1 day dipped below principle but kept adding and maxed out around November and got $ 500 in this year . Due to later contributions I ’ m only up about 10 % so the next bear market would still easily take me below principle . Not_like it really matters in the long run but feels like a milestone to me . A good 5ish years would do it for 1 lump sum investment but with new contributions it would be a lot longer . How long did it take you to get to the point where you were confident even a bad bear market would still leave you in the green overall"

      "selftext": "Given the ongoing and complex geopolitical situation between the U.S. and Venezuela, particularly regarding sanctions, leadership disputes, and the fluctuating status of oil exports, I am curious how others are positioning their portfolios. Are there specific sectors or companies that stand to benefit from these shifts? I’m particularly interested in whether this creates a long-term play for U.S.-based energy giants (like Chevron), or if there are indirect opportunities in neighboring Latin American markets or global commodities. Furthermore, with the potential for future easing or tightening of sanctions depending on U.S. policy shifts, how are you weighing the risk-to-reward ratio? Is it worth looking into distressed debt, or is the political instability still too high of a barrier? Looking forward to hearing your insights and strategies.

      "selftext": "Now that 2025 has wrapped up, it’s interesting to see how different markets performed, it was really goof for US stocks, especially large caps and tech, though many international markets actually delivered stronger returns overall, In other trading news, tokenized stocks are gaining traction, for example, Bitget recently recorded around $1 B in trading volume for these products, these shows there is growing interest in alternative ways to access equities. Looking closer, the MSCI All Country World ex‑USA index, which tracks global stocks outside the US, returned roughly 29 % in 2025, ahead of the S&P 500’s gain of around 16 %, A weaker US dollar also helped boost the dollar adjusted returns of foreign markets, Asian markets, in particular saw notable strength, with South Korea’s KOSPI surging and tech heavy companie leading the way, European indices also posted solid double digit gains across Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK. So while US equities did well, the broader picture shows that global markets outside the US led last year, With trends like international gains and growing adoption of tokenized stocks, it’s worth thinking about how diversification might play into portfolio decisions in 2026.",

Looking closer the MSCI All Country World ex‑USA index which tracks global stocks outside the US returned roughly 29 % in 2025 ahead of the SP 500 ’ s gain of around 16 % A weaker US dollar also helped boost the dollar adjusted returns of foreign markets Asian markets in particular saw notable strength with South Korea ’ s KOSPI surging and tech heavy companie leading the way European indices also posted solid double digit gains across Spain Italy Germany and the UK . So while US equities did well the broader picture shows that global markets outside the US led last year With trends like international gains and growing adoption of tokenized stocks it ’ s worth thinking about how diversification might play into portfolio decisions in 2026 ."

PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant: * ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed. * ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized. * Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational. *Result*? Production fell from \\~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd. **2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like** This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention. **3) Who makes money first?** * **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk. * **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets. * **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty. **Where I put my money** *Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes *Phase 2*: Chevron *Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil **Doubts:** Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done. Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early. About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories. Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours. ⸻ **TL;DR** Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",

      "selftext": "This is my latest summary of stock ideas I drew from this week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine. I didn’t find many specific stock recommendations from the pages because some of the big articles were overviews about dividend paying stocks and international markets, and the official stock pick of Schwab seemed pretty lame to me. **SCHW**. I really cannot endorse this week’s stock pick by Barron’s. It doesn’t make a very good case for investing in Schwab at this time. They point out that Schwab is coming back from a scandal involving paying little to no interest on customer sweep accounts, but the stock was already up 18% in 2025 and the stock is still pretty expensive. The article reads like an advertisement for Schwab, and Schwab is already a big advertiser in Barron’s. Coincidence? **BABA** Alibaba is called out as a stock to buy in the article about international stocks. The case on BABA is based on the outsize earnings growth of international stocks esp emerging markets, their discount to US stock valuations, and China’s ability to go head to head with the US on AI innovation. Alibaba specifically has a full stack of AI assets to lead in AI, a load of cash, and they are the top cloud provider in China. BABA was up 75% in 2025, but still remains at a reasonable PE multiple of 18. **NVDA**. Barron’s cites an analyst report recommending Nvidia as a buy. Specifically the analyst at Mizuho highlights the recent acquisition/license of Groq as a key one that will put Nvidia into a prime position to compete with Alphabet’s TPU on AI inference over the transition period from AI Training to Inference over the coming years. Price target of $245.",

Worst decision ever, now I’m down to about 3.5k and I’m stuck wondering if I should pull it out at a loss and pay off what I can, or just hold. I’m 21 and started investing when I was 19. I bought PLTR, SOFI, NVIDIA, and some other solid stuff around May 2023 and honestly thought I was just a great investor. Then I had to sell at a decent profit to buy a car for college. I started again recently after saving up some money. Normally I just pay off my cards, but I had the “genius” idea to throw it into the market, make a shit ton, and then wipe out the debt and keep the difference. Clearly that didn’t work and the logic was retarded. The fact I could lose so hard in a bull market like this is embarrassing I just went too hard on random stocks and stopped investing started gambling",

Worst decision ever now I ’ m down to about 3.5k and I ’ m stuck wondering if I should pull it out at a loss and pay off what I can or just hold . I ’ m 21 and started investing when I was 19 . I bought PLTR SOFI NVIDIA and some other solid stuff around May 2023 and honestly thought I was just a great investor . Then I had to sell at a decent profit to buy a car for college . I started again recently after saving up some money . Normally I just pay off my cards but I had the “ genius ” idea to throw it into the market make a shit ton and then wipe out the debt and keep the difference . Clearly that didn ’ t work and the logic was retarded . The fact I could lose so hard in a bull market like this is embarrassing I just went too hard on random stocks and stopped investing started gambling"

Re-routing Venezuela’s 900k bpd from China to U.S. gulf coast refiners is simply a trade shuffle and won’t result in any supply/demand changes for a long time. China will simply buy barrels elsewhere but without the the steep discount they get from Venezuela. Even optimistic estimates regarding Venezuela production increases put any additional barrels above 900k bpd 3 to 5 years out (Jeffries put out a note on this today).

My call was for a strike price of $120 and I bought it for $300. I sold the option when exxon was at $122. Now, exxon is at $130 and rose over 6%. I would have made $1500 and I'm just trying not to get frustrated with myself over a skyrocket in price that I couldn't have predicted if I tried. How do you guys go about navigating situations like this? I'm 21 and recently got into trading and am still working on separating emotions from the market. To emphasize why this hurts more, my portfolio was only $300. I put my entire account into that one call (it wasn't as risky because I had a 4 month DTE). However, this would have increased my account size by 5x. Aaaahhhhhh Okay thanks guys I think I was just being dramatic. I will recover and catch the next one :)",

To emphasize why this hurts more my portfolio was only $ 300 . I put my entire account into that one call it wasnt as risky because I had a 4 month DTE . However this would have increased my account size by 5x . Aaaahhhhhh Okay thanks guys I think I was just being dramatic . I will recover and catch the next one"

      "selftext": "AI is hungry. It needs power, lots of it. But the US power grid is old. It wasn’t built for data centers that drink electricity like water. That’s the bottleneck. Quanta Services (PWR) is the uncorker. They don’t build the AI chips. They don’t run the servers. They build the stuff that powers the stuff. Transmission lines. Substations. Underground cables. If electrons need to move from point A to point B, Quanta builds the road. Why them? Scale. The grid is fragmented. Most repair crews are local mom-and-pops. Quanta is massive. They have the labor force. They have the equipment. They can deploy an army of linemen anywhere in the country. Utilities are panicking. They need to upgrade now. They are boosting spending by 25-30% over the next three years. They can’t do it alone. They call Quanta. The proof is in the backlog. They have nearly \\~$40B in signed contracts. That’s not “maybe” money. That’s “we are doing this” money. The numbers (Q3 2025)... Market cap: \\~$64B Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year) Adjusted EPS: $3.33 52-week high: \\~$469 52-week low: \\~$227 The risks... It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too. Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down. Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do. Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why? Dan from Money Machine Newsletter",

Microsoft - 9$ 6. Visa - 9$ 7. Palantir - 8$ 8.Microstrategy - 5$ 9. Nividia - 5$ 10. ASML - 5$ 11. VTI - 5$ 12. CIBR - 5$ 13. Cash - 12$ Total allocated weekly 113$ with 12$ cash reserve (roughly 10%) I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school. With that pause I had 2,750$ left over for the 2025 fiscal year. I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row! Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year. My plan is listed below: I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2,750 total “extra” contributions 250$ cash reserve 2,500$ stocks 2,500 / 26 =96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1. Tesla 2. SCHG 3. Microsoft 4. Microstrategy 5. VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money? I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion. Personally with those 5 plays I would add (EXTRA) 1. 25$ to Tesla 2. 20$ to SCHG 3. 20$ to Microsoft 4. 15$ to Microstrategy 5. 16$ to VTI Or something like that. What’s the move chat?",

Cash 12 $ Total allocated weekly 113 $ with 12 $ cash reserve roughly 10 % I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school . With that pause I had 2750 $ left over for the 2025 fiscal year . I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year . My plan is listed below I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2750 total “ extra ” contributions 250 $ cash reserve 2500 $ stocks 2500 26 96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1 . Tesla 2 . SCHG 3 . Microsoft 4 . Microstrategy 5 . VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion . Personally with those 5 plays I would add EXTRA 1 . 25 $ to Tesla 2 . 20 $ to SCHG 3 . 20 $ to Microsoft 4 . 15 $ to Microstrategy 5 . 16 $ to VTI Or something like that . What ’ s the move chat"

We saw some relatively large moves on Friday from these companies potentially foreshadowing the beginning of the Venezuelan Op over the weekend . Potentially more movements to come as the market prices in more US involvement in their oil industry . One trade that is not_so obvious and I ’ m not_sure has been considered is Venezuelan currency . With the oil fields opening up and US investment moving in there is going to be a huge increase in the velocity of money . Wages need to be paid materials need to be purchased etc . How do you think this will be paid for Bolivar USD Stable Coins Crypto Other You could kind of make a case for any of them"

      "selftext": "The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per) During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?” Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen",

      "selftext_processed": "The year was 2015 . I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school . The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers . I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k . I remember buying Macys Hecla Mining and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better . I was over trading like a mad man . This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7 $ per trade during those days . Just young and dumb not_really making any money . Wasting company time so no_harm no_foul . In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k . Which was basically my life savings at that point in time . I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia . Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes . A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary yes even at that time . I found his aspirations of self driving AI robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape . I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk . I remember talking to my father in law about it . “ What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia ” Too many eggs in one basket was his response . I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia . As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could . $ 200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares . It has been a great ride since then . There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares . It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long . So much bullshit Crypto winter Andrew Left short selling attacks Covid selloffs deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day . I ’ m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house cars investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA . Trading and more specifically Nvidia changed my entire life . Proudly riding with Jensen"

      "title": "[UPDATE] $GT Goodyear Tires: Maduro's Capture Stock Analysis",
      "selftext": "[**Initial DD here**]( ***Note:*** *I've been away on vacation so not much time for new full DDs yet. As to my previous post, I'll be researching and writing up on PayPal (most upvotes). As of now, PYPL is not a long, I am looking into whether its a short or a hold, more information to come.* ==================================================================== We recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market. **Background:** *Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)* **2018** * The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela. * New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**. * Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally. **2019** * January\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. * August\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro. * Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year. ==================================================================== **Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:** **December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees) **December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure \"illegal\" and an act of \"sabotage.\" The government invoked labor laws to immediately \"occupy\" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management. In a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)* If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \\~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can. Before the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain. * In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**. * In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession. * At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**. * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013) Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders. **The Valencia Plant** On September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to \"reactivate and modernize\" the Valencia plant. This investment was directed toward: 1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems. 2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery. 3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards. 4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. It is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers. If this plant was worth \\~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \\~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone. The capital saved by not having to build a greenfield site (a process that would take 24–36 months) allows Goodyear to quickly capture the post-war demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction. *Note: Honestly, I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investments/projects from $GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7-Year old factory into what is needed for $GT's tires. Unfortunately, I'm writing this up on a Sunday and that'd probably take more time than I'm willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence.* **Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs** Raw material costs typically account for 60% of total production expenses, while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20%. The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowest-cost producers in Goodyear’s global portfolio. Goodyear’s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A., a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures, and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis, continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19, 2025. The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia. The Trump administration’s stated goal is to \"get the oil flowing\" by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country’s broken infrastructure. This revival of the domestic petroleum industry, which has seen production stagnate at around 800,000–900,000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million+, will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and high-temperature polymers used in tire tread inserts. The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized, reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant. Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energy-intensive. The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela’s power. While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect, the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts. A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids. **There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM** If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028. **TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. I am confused about the Netflix and WBD deal. WBD agreed to the Netflix deal but it still needs approvals. Paramount also made a hostile bid. WBD said shareholders should reject it. Does that mean the Paramount bid is basically dead, or can it still win. If WBD wanted to take the hostile bid, how much work is it. Is it easy or a long process. If WBD stays with Netflix, what are the main risks and benefits for Netflix in the next year and long term? And do you think the market has already priced this in?

      "selftext": "I believe this news is only partially priced in as we see the spike on Friday with some of the companies that will be involved. I think Chevron CVX is potentially the winner here as they’re already on the ground in Venezuela and have infrastructure there, I can see a spike with CVX on opening on Monday but I think when the news fades it could go down and I believe this could be the same for Crude Oil, I think investors will remember when the news fades that the oil market is already flooded with oil and in Venezuelas oil floods the market it will drive oil prices down further. I don’t think it possible for the oil to be extracted immediately as the already in place infrastructure is severely damaged including old pipelines from Venezuela to the US and over $100 billion in investment is needed and 5 - 8 years for recovery. There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping. One refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term. Another one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.",

      "selftext": "I’m 20, not a trader, and I don’t have much experience in the market. I have about $15k invested total and I’m thinking about putting around 30% of it into a high-risk idea. I want honest opinions, not hype. My thinking is this: Venezuela has huge oil reserves, and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses, their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding. That wouldn’t be fast, but eventually someone has to do the work. Instead of betting on Venezuela directly, I’m looking at companies around it: – Chevron (CVX) since they’re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB, HAL, BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO, MPC, PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I’m unsure about and want feedback on: – Is this already priced in and I’m late to the idea? – If this ever happens, are we talking months or years before it matters? – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions, corruption, or not getting paid? – If you were making a small speculative bet like this, would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely? – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on? I’m not trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything. I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head. Any honest opinions appreciated",

Economic conditions, markets, and regulations can change rapidly, and past performance is not indicative of future results. You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. Ok First of all i'm not good with words im more good with math and numbers... so i'll try to go to the point without too much political and economically approach jargon bs The technicals are out there([screenshot ](#1)... Gold has a certain pattern respecting the top uptrend line resistance, technically we can say from this point of view that it should how ever not 100% should go down and the same downtrend pattern for OIL([screenshot ](#2)... but it would need a catalyst for the prices to truly go down further... if we see the entire economic outlook, wars, inflation etc... there is no catalyst...not until now... and let me give you some evidence. First of all of the PREMISE(or i should say the promise)... USA wants and needs to cut inflation and debt for that they need to lower rates(there is tons of youtube videos of trump talking about lowering inflation and energy cost) if they lower rates yes we would probably get a nice stock bull run market... BUT and here is my point for how long? Evidence number 1: WARREN BUFFET (The greed) [ We are on overvaluated and highly greedy market, naturally markets needs to correct, yes for the new ones markets actually can correct 30% or more... its pure cycles and statistics. Evidence number 2: GOLD and OIL are the number one money wise backing up economic reserves... as the more people and countries accumulate prices go up because accumulation is also shortages and also consumption(chips, rockets..,etc). Evidence number 3: Venezuela is the world largest Oil reserve deposit but how much does the actual refinieries extract and export? Almost nothing(as seen in [scrshot ](#4) because it is under cartel or regime occupation. Evidence number 4: Venezuela is the second to third world largest GOLD(unmined) deposit(8900 tons)... now this is where things get a little tricky because not only this info is backedup by venezuela government but also U.S government and this is where next evidence comes in... Evidence number 5: U.S.A government and military intervention. They have been foresighting this scenario of control for some years now let me give you the source (keyword search: \"8,900\"): [ Now what do i think with this data will happen in the future well now i see 2 possible scenarios to occur, yes they are a bit speculation, but seen the wide angle and data presented for me it makes sense at least. Scenario 1: U.S.A gets controlled of their refineries and start mining and extracting oil and making deals ASAP, since this is new matter entering our economic space will create more supply eventualy causing the prices of everything to fall, energy, goods and services, some stocks might explode because of rates lowering. Scenario 2: China moves to Taiwan and changes government as eficient as USA militarily in Venezuela. Chips supply will fall, causing the U.S.A to prepare for the next Chips Recesion, either they'll need to move their photolitography out of the contry or rebuild it abroad... causing the economy of U.S.A to stagnate... AI develop will slowdown causing tech companies to correct... USA is preparing itself for china's next move thats why they need those refineries to start working thats how they will balance their economy as prices go down, they'll start acumulating more and more resources for the next A.I race between china and USA... A.I firsts Nuclear powered plants are set to be running by 2028-30 so they need to prepare for whats comming. >This is my bet puts on gold($3500), oil($40), and tech stock market NVIDIA($140)(only if china moves pieces) expiration date march 2027 What are your thoughts?",

Economic conditions markets and regulations can change rapidly and past performance is not_indicative of future results . You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions . Ok First of all im not_good with words im more good with math and numbers ... so ill try to go to the point without too much political and economically approach jargon bs The technicals are out therescreenshot 1 ... Gold has a certain pattern respecting the top uptrend line resistance technically we can say from this point of view that it should how ever not_100 % should go down and the same downtrend pattern for OILscreenshot 2 ... but it would need a catalyst for the prices to truly go down further ... if we see the entire economic outlook wars inflation etc ... there is no_catalyst ... not until now ... and let me give you some evidence . First of all of the PREMISEor i should say the promise ... USA wants and needs to cut inflation and debt for that they need to lower ratesthere is tons of youtube videos of trump talking about lowering inflation and energy cost if they lower rates yes we would probably get a nice stock bull run market ... BUT and here is my point for how long Evidence number 1 WARREN BUFFET The greed We are on overvaluated and highly greedy market naturally markets needs to correct yes for the new ones markets actually can correct 30 % or more ... its pure cycles and statistics . Evidence number 2 GOLD and OIL are the number one money wise backing up economic reserves ... as the more people and countries accumulate prices go up because accumulation is also shortages and also consumptionchips rockets .. etc . Evidence number 3 Venezuela is the world largest Oil reserve deposit but how much does the actual refinieries extract and export Almost nothingas_seen in scrshot 4 because it is under cartel or regime occupation . Evidence number 4 Venezuela is the second to third world largest GOLDunmined deposit8900 tons ... now this is where things get a little tricky because not_only this info is backedup by venezuela government but also U.S government and this is where next evidence comes in ... Evidence number 5 U.S.A government and military intervention . They have been foresighting this scenario of control for some years now let me give you the source keyword search 8900 Now what do i think with this data will happen in the future well now i see 2 possible scenarios to occur yes they are a bit speculation but seen the wide angle and data presented for me it makes sense at least . Scenario 1 U.S.A gets controlled of their refineries and start mining and extracting oil and making deals ASAP since this is new matter entering our economic space will create more supply eventualy causing the prices of everything to fall energy goods and services some stocks might explode because of rates lowering . Scenario 2 China moves to Taiwan and changes government as eficient as USA militarily in Venezuela . Chips supply will fall causing the U.S.A to prepare for the next Chips Recesion either theyll need to move their photolitography out of the contry or rebuild it abroad ... causing the economy of U.S.A to stagnate ... AI develop will slowdown causing tech companies to correct ... USA is preparing itself for chinas next move thats why they need those refineries to start working thats how they will balance their economy as prices go down theyll start acumulating more and more resources for the next A.I race between china and USA ... A.I firsts Nuclear powered plants are set to be running by 202830 so they need to prepare for whats comming . This is my bet puts on gold $ 3500 oil $ 40 and tech stock market NVIDIA $ 140only if china moves pieces expiration date march 2027 What are your thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I have a question and appreciate any insight or guidance. I am able to put away at least 2k/month. Last year, I put it all into a HYSA paying 3.5%. This year though, I am planning to do something different based on 2 ideas. First idea is that it’s way more beneficial to be invested in something of value that appreciates. Second idea is that energy/infrastructure, robotics, and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets. With that in mind, I plan to split the 2000/month 4 ways; 500 into a Roth IRA (holding VT/SCHG/ROBO/XLU), 500 into HYSA, 500 into QQQI/SLVR, 500 into *something else*. It’s the something else that I have a question about. Below are the stocks I’m considering: Energy/Infra: TAN, GRID, IREN Metals: SILJ, REMX, GLTR. ROBOTICS: ARKQ Moonshots: ETHA, BMNR, IBIT, JD, QXO, SLS, POET, CSIQ, AMPX, TE, ARRY, LAC, PATH. I plan to have a combination of shares/leaps from 2-3 of those. Eventually, want to get into covered calls too. Goal is to grow account and eventually start generating passive income. Any critique, information, or advice is welcomed. I have a pension, 457b, and 30k in crypto. I’m 34 and expecting a child next year.",

Second idea is that energyinfrastructure robotics and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets . With that in mind I plan to split the 2000month 4 ways 500 into a Roth IRA holding VTSCHGROBOXLU 500 into HYSA 500 into QQQISLVR 500 into something else .

      "selftext": "Venezuela’s infrastructure is broken. Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking. It will take billions and years of work by companies like **Schlumberger** and **Halliburton** to get production back to 2 million barrels per day. Now to the reffineries: The real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread, which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel. When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling. Logistics: The shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles. (any suggestions?) Finally, you have to consider the impact on the US shale industry. If the return of Venezuelan barrels pushes the price of WTI crude below the fifty dollar mark, many US producers in places like the Permian Basin will no longer be profitable(?).",

      "selftext_processed": "Venezuela ’ s infrastructure is broken . Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking . It will take billions and years of work by companies like Schlumberger and Halliburton to get production back to 2 million barrels per day . Now to the reffineries The real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel . When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market the input costs for complex refiners like Valero or Marathon Petroleum drop drastically . Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling . Logistics The shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid . Currently Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive shiptoship transfers to bypass sanctions . A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States . Instead of a fortyday journey to China the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles . any suggestions Finally you have to consider the impact on the US shale industry . If the return of Venezuelan barrels pushes the price of WTI crude below the fifty dollar mark many US producers in places like the Permian Basin will no_longer be profitable ."

      "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants? 1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. 2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. 3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless. 4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. 5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR… Personally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall. Oil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years. Did i miss anything?",

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a (fledgling) Value Investor. It has been a very interesting ride to say the least, and I feel I've learned a lot over that time. Naturally, there is still a lot more for me to learn. Of course, one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the long-term. It is a question I'm sure we all ask ourselves. I know 5 years is not \"long-term\", however, it's a good checkpoint along the path. So, here are my results against the S&P 500 benchmark (w/dividends included for both) and brief thoughts on what I learned: |Year / Portfolio|My Portfolio|S&P 500^(1)| |:-|:--:|:--:| |2021|15.95%|28.26%| |2022|\\-29.46%|\\-14.99%| |2023|42.86%|21.69%| |2024|43.99%|30.03%| |2025|25.05%|15.45%| |**CAGR**|**16.04%**|**14.78%**| ^(1 - S&P 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars & Data.) 2021: 11 positions EOY. This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first. Mistakes were made... Most, if not All, of them. My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noise/static/garbage, and should not be heavily weighted as \"research\". 2022: Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year. Acquired three new positions (one spin-off). New META position closed $120 with my cost basis was ~$197. The other hurt was MHH; I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop. Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage, but I should have applied to MHH also. Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down w/META, which I should not have applied to MHH. 2023: This year was mainly building on what I already owned. I sold out a very small position in IDN, started in 2021. Bought with no real due diligence, then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled. Sold at a 73% loss. Started with 10 positions. Ended with 10 positions. I don't know that there was huge lesson to '23. I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss, but held a few months longer as a reminder. 2024: I had a bit more movement this year. I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out (MDC). Realized I didn't know enough to hold WAL or MU, which fell outside my circle of competence. Hindsight being 20/20, I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU... Started three new positions. The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions. 9 positions. 2025: I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position. With MHH, I realized there was an emotional attachment, that management was not turning it around, and accepted my thesis was wrong. Took the ~40% loss. I also tested out selling covered calls. Did this with WBD, which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years. Lesson 1 was I'm still human and at times irrational. I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally, such as with MHH. Lesson 2 is that I do not understand options well at all, and I am really not temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding. Lesson 3 was/is a reminder to be patient. I did not find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued. And that is okay! I don't need to swing at any pitches to do well.

      "selftext_processed": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a fledgling Value Investor . It has been a very interesting ride to say the least and I feel Ive learned a lot over that time . Naturally there is still a lot more for me to learn . Of course one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the longterm . It is a question Im sure we all ask ourselves . I know 5 years is not_longterm however its a good checkpoint along the path . So here are my results against the SP 500 benchmark wdividends included for both and brief thoughts on what I learned Year PortfolioMy PortfolioSP 5001 202115.95 % 28.26 % 202229.46 % 14.99 % 202342.86 % 21.69 % 202443.99 % 30.03 % 202525.05 % 15.45 % CAGR16.04 % 14.78 % 1 SP 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars Data . 2021 11 positions EOY . This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first . Mistakes were made ... Most if not_All of them . My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noisestaticgarbage and should not_be heavily weighted as research . 2022 Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year . Acquired three new positions one spinoff . New META position closed $ 120 with my cost basis was $ 197 . The other hurt was MHH I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop . Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage but I should have applied to MHH also . Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down wMETA which I should not_have applied to MHH . 2023 This year was mainly building on what I already owned . I sold out a very small position in IDN started in 2021 . Bought with no_real due diligence then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled . Sold at a 73 % loss . Started with 10 positions . Ended with 10 positions . I dont know that there was huge lesson to 23 . I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss but held a few months longer as a reminder . 2024 I had a bit more movement this year . I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out MDC . Realized I didnt know enough to hold WAL or MU which fell outside my circle of competence . Hindsight being 2020 I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU ... Started three new positions . The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions . 9 positions . 2025 I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position . With MHH I realized there was an emotional attachment that management was not_turning it around and accepted my thesis was wrong . Took the 40 % loss . I also tested out selling covered calls . Did this with WBD which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years . Lesson 1 was Im still human and at times irrational . I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally such as with MHH . Lesson 2 is that I do not_understand options well at all and I am really not_temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding . Lesson 3 wasis a reminder to be patient . I did not_find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued . And that is okay I dont need to swing at any pitches to do well . cross post full text from Value Investing sub"

      "selftext": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA, MU, META, GOOGL, MSFT and LLY. This week, I’m taking a deeper dive into META. [META Valuation Analysis]( Trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue through 9/30/25 was $189 billion with a 43% operating margin. The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21% in 2025 to $199 billion and 18% in 2026 to $235 billion. 99% of revenue and 122% of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division. This is comprised of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. The Reality Labs division generated $2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $18 billion. **Value Score** META generates 61 Value Points from 43% TTM operating margin plus 18% projected revenue growth. Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a **Value Score of 3.5**. This puts META firmly in Buy territory. There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI. Given that statement, I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company. TTM capital expenditures were $63 billion, 68% higher than $37 billion for 2024. The company’s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $70-72 billion. For 2026, I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance. This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow. The **adjusted Value Score of 1.5** is firmly in Hold territory. **Segment Valuation** Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value. The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $100 billion is 3.36, while the median Value Points is 25.84. This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple. For simplicity and to be generous, **I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division**. I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps’ $187 billion of revenue. I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs’ $2 billion of revenue, which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric. The formula suggests that **META has 27% potential upside in its stock price**. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA MU META GOOGL MSFT and LLY . This week I ’ m taking a deeper dive into META . META Valuation Analysis Trailing twelvemonth TTM revenue through 93025 was $ 189 billion with a 43 % operating margin . The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21 % in 2025 to $ 199 billion and 18 % in 2026 to $ 235 billion . 99 % of revenue and 122 % of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division . This is comprised of Facebook Instagram WhatsApp etc . The Reality Labs division generated $ 2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $ 18 billion . Value Score META generates 61 Value Points from 43 % TTM operating margin plus 18 % projected revenue growth . Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a Value Score of 3.5 . This puts META firmly in Buy territory . There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI . Given that statement I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company . TTM capital expenditures were $ 63 billion 68 % higher than $ 37 billion for 2024 . The company ’ s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $ 7072 billion . For 2026 I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance . This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow . The adjusted Value Score of 1.5 is firmly in Hold territory . Segment Valuation Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value . The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $ 100 billion is 3.36 while the median Value Points is 25.84 . This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple . For simplicity and to be generous I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division . I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps ’ $ 187 billion of revenue . I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs ’ $ 2 billion of revenue which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric . The formula suggests that META has 27 % potential upside in its stock price . As always please do your own research before making any investment decision ."

      "selftext": "Recently started a new position with the local government, and hoping for some advice. I have a \"Retirement Plan\" account with my previous employer, and have both pre-tax and after tax funds mixed in. I also have an ESOP, it is a privately traded company, and no dividends. Currently my plan is to roll over the pre-tax portion of the \"Retirement Plan\" and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA, and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA. My question is, is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b? (The 457b is brand new, has a limited selection of only 25 stocks/bonds/TDFs, and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF.) Also, I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA. I currently dont plan to retire early, and in the set it and forget it mindset. I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not, but if any is needed I can add it. Ultimately, is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA?",

Currently my plan is to roll over the pretax portion of the Retirement Plan and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA . My question is is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b The 457b is brand new has a limited selection of only 25 stocksbondsTDFs and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF . Also I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA . I currently dont plan to retire early and in the set it and forget it mindset . I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not_but if any is needed I can add it . Ultimately is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA"

      "title": "The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals).",
      "selftext": "My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally. That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains. My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested. I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era…. The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities. Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market. History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price. That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials. I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure. That’s the bet. TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned. Edit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "My investment thesis is straightforward over the next decade markets will increasingly reward secure politically aligned supply chains not_simply the lowestcost producers . Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy and when that happens pricing capital flows and valuations change structurally . That ’ s why I ’ m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Westernaligned supply chains . My core holdings are Energy Fuels UUUU Cameco CCJ Centrus Energy LEU MP Materials MP and Lynas LYSDY . $ 300k USD invested . I chose these USUS allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities can not easily replace . Together they cover uranium mining nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment and rare earth production and processing outside of China . China controls the majority of these rare earths and following Venezeula supply restrictions are only going to get worse . We ’ re in the hoarding era… . The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story but I think that framing misses the larger signal . Whether oil supply increases or not_is secondary . The more important takeaway is geopolitical the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved . That reinforces a world where energy materials and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than freemarket commodities . Importantly Venezuela does not_pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths . These markets are nothing_like oil . Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through longterm contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance . Rare earths require not_just mining but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop . There is no_mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market . History supports this view . During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run prices did not_rise because of speculative demand alone . They rose because utilities realized they were undercontracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure longterm supply . Once utilities began competing for material prices moved violently and quickly and equities rerated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated . Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was . I expect a very similar situation to take place between 20262028 . After Venezuela the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Skyrocket . Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren ’ t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises . When utilities and governments fear supply disruption they don ’ t negotiate for the best price they secure supply at almost any price . That historical lesson matters today . Nuclear power is expanding globally enrichment capacity is constrained and nonChina rare earth supply remains limited . At the same time geopolitical risk is rising not_falling . If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be riskoff across all assets . But the secondorder effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy subsidies and longterm contracts favoring Westernaligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials . I ’ m not_positioned for a shortterm commodity spike . I ’ m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost just as they did in prior cycles . In those environments uranium and rare earth equities don ’ t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure . That ’ s the bet . TLDR Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets history shows these markets don ’ t reprice gradually they reprice violently when supply security is questioned .

      "selftext": "Edited / reaubmitted to show 20k position. I reported a while back that Deutz is the play. Here is my updated analysis for you to lose granny's inheritance on. **DEUTZ** is the boring German grandpa engine stock that woke up one morning and realised it now owns batteries, drone drives and backup power, but the market still values it like it only sells tractor parts🚜. This grandpa is quietly wiring itself into everything from electrified construction kit to military drone drives and decentralized generators, which means it gets paid whether the world is building roads or preparing for the next crisis.

      "title": "BYD +5% after becoming world’s top EV seller with 2.26M units as Tesla deliveries fall 8.6% in 2025",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor. But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game. >The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week. >BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history. >BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market. >In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1. >Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025. >Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers. >Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites. >The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year. >To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features. >Aggressive competition >BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets. >Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars. >BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025. >While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share. >From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%. >Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies. >Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end",

      "selftext_processed": "Source In 2011 Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor . But some 14 years later BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game . The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world ’ s largest seller of EVs according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week . BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs up nearly 28 % from 2024 . Meanwhile Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales Deliveries fell 8.6 % to only 1.6 million recording the biggest annual drop in the company ’ s history . BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not_available for purchase in America while China is Tesla ’ s secondlargest market . In the fourth quarter Tesla ’ s sales came in at about 418000 down 15.6 % from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $ 7500 tax credit expired on October 1 . Unlike other automakers Tesla does not_report its sales by market providing only global figures but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue according to company reports . Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025 . Tesla ’ s deliveries had grown nearly 50 % a year at one point . But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 posting a modest 1 % decline . Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers such a BYD and legacy global automakers as well as backlash against Musk ’ s political activities which angered many potential American and European buyers . Early in the year when Musk was leading the Trump administration ’ s Department of Government Efficiency there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites . The rush to take advantage of the soontoexpire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter . But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year . To try to counter the loss of the tax credit Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars but those versions while costing about $ 5000 less than their “ premium ” equivalents also won ’ t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features . Aggressive competition BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market . The intense __ in China has prompted the Shenzhenbased company to expand further overseas though its lowprice strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets . Growth in BYD ’ s overall sales including EVs and hybrids slowed to its weakest pace in five years with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company ’ s struggles in China the world ’ s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars . BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025 . While China ’ s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers according to HSBC ’ s research . Rivals like Geely China ’ s secondlargest EV maker fastrising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi which debuted its first EV only in 2024 have gradually eroded BYD ’ s domestic market share . From a peak of 35 % in 2023 BYD ’ s market share fell to 29 % in the first 11 months of 2025 according to China Passenger Car Association . In the same period last year its sales declined more than 5 % while Geely ’ s surged nearly 90 % . Wang Chuanfu BYD ’ s founder and CEO attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD ’ s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting according to staterun media . But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies . Shares of Tesla TSLA rose 1.2 % in early trading Friday . Shares closed 2025 up 18.6 % for the year as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk ’ s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “ army ” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon . But so far the rollout of Tesla ’ s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises limited to two metropolitan areas Austin Texas and San Francisco rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year ’ s end"

Here are the key figures from the release: Q4 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles (vs. estimates around 440,907) Q4 production: 434,358 vehicles (vs. projected \\~470,780) Full-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles On the surface, this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production, which would normally pressure the stock. Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open. A few possible reasons for the move: Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization, AI/robotics, autonomy, or longer-term narratives rather than near-term unit counts Positioning and short-term flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today’s session: Is this strength sustainable, or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully? Curious how others are reading this, bullish resilience, or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in?",

There are thousands of people taking payouts, but that have spent minimum 4x the amount to get paid once for that dopamine hit. Just to share some analytics without giving too much away, my firm has paid out over 50m+ in the last year, and they profit at around 55-60% margins. And this only grows as they change their plans. Please understand that if you are trying to get rich quick all you do is make them richer. They are designed to seem helpful, but in reality if they were they'd give 1:1 drawdown. They tighten the rules. make things harder for an already difficult market. Please do not blow all your money on these firms. If you have an edge, compound it. Stop going for those big accounts and trying to get paid at minimum pay days.",

Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely. The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable / tax advantaged accounts, I have the following to mull over... * Taxable vs retirement: * 39% taxable * 61% retirement * Across all those, ratio of holding types: * 95% equities * 5% cash / treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence. Let the critiquing / discussion begin (if this is not boring or out of suitable questions). Thx in advance!",

Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely . The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable tax advantaged accounts I have the following to mull over ... Taxable vs retirement 39 % taxable 61 % retirement Across all those ratio of holding types 95 % equities 5 % cash treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence . Let the critiquing discussion begin if this is not_boring or out of suitable questions . Thx in advance"

      "selftext": "Noted that this is anectdotal, but I was reading this article about California new rules for refunds. Somewhat interesting. [ Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you. At 7 p.m., we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late, and it will be 7:25 instead of 7:05. At 7:28, I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 7:15 still? So, I call the Dasher, they tell me that their tablet broke, no one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed. I text Doordash - no response ever. Then I call Doordash. I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund. I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesn't get picked up. The rep can't help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor. The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors, I'm 34th in line so I will get a call back. I ask when. They said it could be 2 hours. A company worth $100B market cap that has invested $billions in technology that cannot: manage a simple driver change, manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice, cannot manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours... This is systematic. Nothing works across their enterprise after billions spent. Of course, this is just my issue, but I've seen this before. This would never have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything. I know this is a vent, but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law, how others will follow, and if Dash has any management capability to improve. I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed. \"This happens all the time with Doordash\" were not the words an investor or customer would want to hear.",

Sure, Alexa and Kindle were cool, but honestly, they’re more the exception than the rule, and neither of them is exactly leading the charge anymore. As we move past the platform era, Amazon’s reliance on third party innovation especially when it comes to AI may hurt its ability to compete in a space where AI driven products are taking over. What do you think? Can Amazon pivot and catch up or is it too late for them to lead in AI?",

      "title": "TSLA Q4 Delivery Misses Expectations, But Energy Storage Shows Strong Growth",
      "selftext": "Tesla just reported Q4 deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, missing the market's expectations of 440,907, a 5.2% drop. Full year deliveries came in at 1.64 million, down 8.6% YoY, with an estimate of 1.6 million. The Q4 miss can be attributed to a few key factors: the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, the aging product line (Model 3/Y still lead but are lacking major updates), increased competition in Europe and China, and some brand image issues. However, the energy storage business has been a bright spot, with deployments hitting 14.2 GWh in Q4 (up 29% YoY) and a total of 46.7 GWh for the year. Demand for Megapack and Powerwall remains strong, which is definitely a positive for the energy division. From a technical perspective, the stock is in a bearish environment, with support at 440 and resistance at 460. The bullish signal at 460 from December 30 has pretty much played out, and the stock has recently dipped below the 440 support. If it doesn’t reclaim 440, it’s likely to fall to 432.5 and 420. If the stock reclaims 440 next week, we could see a rebound, testing the 445, 450, and 460 resistance levels. However, unless it breaks 460 and re-enters a bullish environment, any rally could be short-lived. For those looking to go long, it might be better to wait until the stock breaks and holds above 460 before jumping in. Entering in a bearish market might leave you stuck in a losing position.",

I am selling all VOO/VTI and replacing with them looking toward a future in 2026 with a weaker dollar and a much larger US debt. SMH is my high risk bet with a 15% trailing stop (and it cranked +3% today so far), I think SMH is the play for 2026 but don't want to be the bag holder when AI purchasing grinds to a halt and it will at some point. **2026 Portfolio Allocation** 30% SCHG (Growth), **US Growth:** Cash-rich monopolies that survive high rates. 20% SCHD (Value), **US Quality:** Companies with real profits, avoiding the \"zombies\" in VTI. 15% SMH (Semis), **High Risk Bet** in the AI buildout 15% Gold (GLD), **The Insurance:** Protection against US dollar \"debasement.\" 10% Int'l (VYMI), **The Escape:** Exposure to non-US economies. 10% Cash (SGOV), **The Parking:** Earns 5% yield while waiting for volatility, keeping any cash here and will DCA in monthly. Because of how US Debt is shifting, buying VTI is not sufficient anymore. I can't prove it but I think the long-term play for the USA is to try and herd everyone into crypto for a pump-n-dump in an effort to pay down the debt. Consider this [The Quiet, Fateful Shift in Who’s Buying America’s Debt]( I named this the \"Gretsky retail investment strategy\", because I am trying to skate to where the puck is going, not where it is today or the path it has been on. No disrespect to the Boggle-Heads but take a hard look at \"VOO and chill\" strategy 5-years from now vs. this allocation. I await your flaming arrows.",

I am selling all VOOVTI and replacing with them looking toward a future in 2026 with a weaker dollar and a much larger US debt . SMH is my high risk bet with a 15 % trailing stop and it cranked 3 % today so far I think SMH is the play for 2026 but dont want to be the bag holder when AI purchasing grinds to a halt and it will at some point . 2026 Portfolio Allocation 30 % SCHG Growth US Growth Cashrich monopolies that survive high rates . 20 % SCHD Value US Quality Companies with real profits avoiding the zombies in VTI . 15 % SMH Semis High Risk Bet in the AI buildout 15 % Gold GLD The Insurance Protection against US dollar debasement . 10 % Intl VYMI The Escape Exposure to nonUS economies . 10 % Cash SGOV The Parking Earns 5 % yield while waiting for volatility keeping any cash here and will DCA in monthly . Because of how US Debt is shifting buying VTI is not_sufficient anymore . I cant prove it but I think the longterm play for the USA is to try and herd everyone into crypto for a pumpndump in an effort to pay down the debt . Consider this The Quiet Fateful Shift in Who ’ s Buying America ’ s Debt I named this the Gretsky retail investment strategy because I am trying to skate to where the puck is going not_where it is today or the path it has been on . No_disrespect to the BoggleHeads but take a hard look at VOO and chill strategy 5years from now vs. this allocation . I await your flaming arrows ."

I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.",

      "selftext": "First trading day of the year, which means maxing out my Roth IRA, but I have basically ZERO international exposure. I started this Roth IRA back in 2017 and for that first year I dumped everything into VFIFX (2050 Target Date Fund). 2018 to present I have been putting it all into VTSAX because I realized I don't need bonds quite yet. Now as I'm learning more I realize I should probably diversify more to include a greater % of international stocks. The breakdown of the target date fund is around 55 US / 36 INT / 6 US Bond / 2 INT Bond, but this is currently only about 15% of my Roth IRA portfolio. The other 85% is VTSAX. When I started this Roth IRA for whatever reason I chose the mutual funds over the ETF equivalents (maybe ETF wasn't offered then?), and now for my 2026 contribution I'm only given a choice to contribute to another Vanguard Mutual Fund, my 2050 Target Date Fund, or my VTSAX fund. If I wanted to throw this $7500 into an international fund, which should I use? Most of the funds I'm aware of are ETFs, and it doesn't seem I can contribute to an ETF, only Mutual Fund. Should I put it all into VTIAX (Total International Stock Market Fund) then? That would only bring my international allocation up to about 12% within this IRA. Can I transact within the IRAs existing shares to trade some VTSAX shares to International Shares? Or maybe better to get rid of the 2050 Target Date fund shares in favor of International Shares, because that would also ditch the bonds for now? I also see there is an (irreversible option) to convert my mutual fund shares to the ETF equivalents, but I'm not sure if that's worthwhile in this case. FWIW - the Roth IRA sits around $100k (86k VTSAX & 14k VFIFX). I plan on working another 25-30 years, and as a public employee will be looking to start a 403b and then a taxable brokerage account this year. So I suppose another option would be to leave the Roth allocation as is, put the 7500 into more VTSAX, and then start off the other accounts with heavier international exposure? Any and all advice is welcome, thanks.",

      "selftext_processed": "First trading day of the year which means maxing out my Roth IRA but I have basically ZERO international exposure . I started this Roth IRA back in 2017 and for that first year I dumped everything into VFIFX 2050 Target Date Fund . 2018 to present I have been putting it all into VTSAX because I realized I dont need bonds quite yet . Now as Im learning more I realize I should probably diversify more to include a greater % of international stocks . The breakdown of the target date fund is around 55 US 36 INT 6 US Bond 2 INT Bond but this is currently only about 15 % of my Roth IRA portfolio . The other 85 % is VTSAX . When I started this Roth IRA for whatever reason I chose the mutual funds over the ETF equivalents maybe ETF wasnt offered then and now for my 2026 contribution Im only given a choice to contribute to another Vanguard Mutual Fund my 2050 Target Date Fund or my VTSAX fund . If I wanted to throw this $ 7500 into an international fund which should I use Most of the funds Im aware of are ETFs and it doesnt seem I can contribute to an ETF only Mutual Fund . Should I put it all into VTIAX Total International Stock Market Fund then That would only bring my international allocation up to about 12 % within this IRA . Can I transact within the IRAs existing shares to trade some VTSAX shares to International Shares Or maybe better to get rid of the 2050 Target Date fund shares in favor of International Shares because that would also ditch the bonds for now I also see there is an irreversible option to convert my mutual fund shares to the ETF equivalents but Im not_sure if thats worthwhile in this case . FWIW the Roth IRA sits around $ 100k 86k VTSAX 14k VFIFX . I plan on working another 2530 years and as a public employee will be looking to start a 403b and then a taxable brokerage account this year . So I suppose another option would be to leave the Roth allocation as is put the 7500 into more VTSAX and then start off the other accounts with heavier international exposure Any and all advice is welcome thanks ."

I just launched a market analysis side project and would love some feedback. **About me / disclaimer:** I’m not a finance professional, just a designer who hyperfixated on building a more human-readable way to gauge market and economic “health.” **This is a vibe-coded context tool, not investment advice, predictions, or signals.** Mostly posting to get smarter eyes on it and see what I’m missing. I wanted something transparent that blends multiple signals into an empathic context without pretending to predict the market. **What it is** The **Market Diagnostic Dashboard** is a real-time tool that tracks \\~10 indicators across six domains to give a high-level snapshot of overall market stability: * **Volatility & Equity:** VIX, SPY * **Rates & Curve:** Fed Funds Rate, 10Y–2Y * **Employment:** U.S. Unemployment * **Bonds:** Credit spreads, curve dynamics, Treasury volatility * **Liquidity:** M2 growth, Fed balance sheet, RRP usage * **Sentiment:** Analyst, consumer, and corporate sentiment Each indicator is scored **0–100** (higher = healthier) and combined into a weighted composite that classifies conditions as **GREEN** (stable), **YELLOW** (caution), or **RED** (stress). **What it includes** * Live data from FRED + Yahoo Finance + Seeking Alpha * 1 year of historical context with charts * Dow Theory–based market strain analysis * Market news for a custom ticker list + full methodology docs * Free, no ads/paywalls. Only using publically available data to draw conclusions. **Would love thoughts on** * Indicators to add/remove * Sanity check on if my current indicators measure viable stats/trends * Whether the weighting makes sense (it’s a bit vibe-based) * How you’d actually use this * Bugs or UX issues",

      "selftext": "In early December 2025, I performed a back door ROTH for the first time last month. I opened up a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and deposited $8k (I am 50 yo) into the settlement account (which was SPAXX). As soon as the system allowed me to do it (I was checking daily, multiple times a day … it took a couple of days), I changed the settlement position to Cash FDIC deposit), and then I transferred the $8k into my ROTH IRA. The traditional IRA showed 0, which is what it should be. All good for the past month. Today I saw there is $1.21 in the settlement account of my traditional IRA. I guess the money must have earned interest during the 1-2 days it was sitting in there. I obviously don’t want any money sitting in my traditional IRA. What should I do? I’m actually thinking I will perform another backdoor Roth, contributing $8498.79 and then immediately move ALL in the funds in the account to my Roth IRA. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "2025 ended up being a pretty great year! 47% return for $6,800,000 A decent amount of gains are from selling options, and some great gains on being heavy long on RDDT and GOOG with shares and calls). All in all, I typically have around 30 unique tickers and about 150 positions open at any given time. Those positions can be relatively small, up to hundreds of contracts. Yes, lots of people had better returns in 2025. I’m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges. With the market going up for 8 months straight, my hedges hurt quite a bit. But should a black swan event have occurred, or the market switched to bear mode, I would have done pretty well (especially compared to the market). Here’s to 2026 being a good one as well!",

All in all I typically have around 30 unique tickers and about 150 positions open at any given time . Those positions can be relatively small up to hundreds of contracts . Yes lots of people had better returns in 2025 . I ’ m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges . With the market going up for 8 months straight my hedges hurt quite a bit . But should a black swan event have occurred or the market switched to bear mode I would have done pretty well especially compared to the market . Here ’ s to 2026 being a good one as well"

      "selftext": "I have been lurking in here for many years now, and I think its an extraordinary place to find undervalued stocks or great businesses overall, either to trade or to invest in. I have seen it mentioned here before, but even then, maybe 1% of the amount of mentions it truly deserves. this stock is HIMS. I believe (my bad, I mean I KNOW), it is going to potentially triple, or even more, in 2026, and every person here should take a look at it. Lets look at the facts: First of all, their financial statements 1. Revenue has been increasing for many years now, 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024, and expected 2.25b in 2025. Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2. Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4. Buying back shares 5. Great Margins Technicals: It has been on a long-term uptrend since may of 2022, with higher highs, and higher lows. during this time, it has had 10 declines of 30% or more (3 of them 50% or more, including the current one). EACH TIME it declined, it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 65-70$ range. This year, it made its ATH in February at 73$, and it touched the 65-70$ range 4 times, which is now a major resistance range. currently, its at 33 dollars, which is its 3rd 50%+ decline, and 10th decline of 30% or more since may 2022. NOT BUYING right now, does not make ANY SENSE. its had a 100% success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years, and now its no different. It has now made a double bottom, and its already at a pretty nice support level. I believe it has BOTTOMED. Moreover, this year alone, they have announced LABS, Canada expansion, Europe expansion, some acquisitions, Testosterone treatments, and many more to come. Now, just due to technicals its a very easy double from here, BUT, I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026, and this is why: 1. Institutional Ownership - 239m shares. Shares outstanding - 228m Total float of shares - 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT - 67m. this stock is ridiculously shorted, with 0 logic behind it, and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2. Potential NVO partnership, which is a major catalyst if it happens (and I think it will). 3. Rumors about the FDA & HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding. HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility. If this is true, ITS MASSIVE. the potential catalysts + fundamentals + Technicals are saying 1 thing - the stock is going to have a great 2026, and im very shocked it is not the 1# mention here. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, im just sharing my opinion. my position - 6000 shares at 39.76$",

I have seen it mentioned here before but even then maybe 1 % of the amount of mentions it truly deserves . this stock is HIMS . I believe my bad I mean I KNOW it is going to potentially triple or even more in 2026 and every person here should take a look at it . Lets look at the facts First of all their financial statements 1 . Revenue has been increasing for many years now 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024 and expected 2.25b in 2025 . Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2 . Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4 . Buying back shares 5 . Great Margins Technicals It has been on a longterm uptrend since may of 2022 with higher highs and higher lows . during this time it has had 10 declines of 30 % or more 3 of them 50 % or more including the current one . EACH TIME it declined it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 6570 $ range . This year it made its ATH in February at 73 $ and it touched the 6570 $ range 4 times which is now a major resistance range . currently its at 33 dollars which is its 3rd 50 % decline and 10th decline of 30 % or more since may 2022 . NOT_BUYING right now does not_make ANY SENSE . its had a 100 % success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years and now its no_different . It has now made a double bottom and its already at a pretty nice support level . I believe it has BOTTOMED . Moreover this year alone they have announced LABS Canada expansion Europe expansion some acquisitions Testosterone treatments and many more to come . Now just due to technicals its a very easy double from here BUT I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026 and this is why 1 . Institutional Ownership 239m shares . Shares outstanding 228m Total float of shares 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT 67m . this stock is ridiculously shorted with 0 logic behind it and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2 . Potential NVO partnership which is a major catalyst if it happens and I think it will . 3 . Rumors about the FDA HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding . HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility . If this is true ITS MASSIVE . the potential catalysts fundamentals Technicals are saying 1 thing the stock is going to have a great 2026 and im very shocked it is not_the 1 mention here . This is NOT_FINANCIAL ADVICE im just sharing my opinion . my position 6000 shares at 39.76 $"

      "selftext": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick. I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened... The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism. I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\". [The delivery process]( I instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open. **If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.** I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip. # Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer? It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly: 1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000 Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important): ± 200 people / 100.000 **.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.** ( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.) \\----- Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts: Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors). This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that. Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission. So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed): USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.** [Unlocking my full potential]( Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower. Now that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern. # A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter. If you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE. 1. The technical guy who actually knows shit 2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO. This is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China. The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart. The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team. After the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely). The best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit. All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial. # Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of: \"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant) The study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying. So why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive. **WHY?:** * Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups * You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%) * All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis. * A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn. **But most importantly:** * BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS. # Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money. # So Why Are You Bearish? Well I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?: (1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) (2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) Which is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)? I'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation. The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately. Hence I'm buying puts. **NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement. **My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:** EDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.",

      "selftext_processed": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick . I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing_happened ... The problem Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it wont speed up its effects . You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached Llysine amino acid that breaks off in your body using enzymes ... thus creating this slowrelease mechanism . I wasnt discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me the edge . The delivery process I instantly got hit with Writers euphoria some people say they see colors all I saw was a pumpndump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump . Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open . If you havent figured it out yet Im talking about SLS . I will attack this pumpndump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this short trip . Buckle up buckeroos were gon na start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt . cap close to USD 600M . First thing that I ask is who is the customer Its a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 12 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer Acute Myleoid Leukemia . If we look at how many people get it globally were gon na arrive at roughly 1.52.0 persons 100.000 Now lets look at all cancers this will be important ± 200 people 100.000 .... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN . What I didnt realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being . Why am I mentioning all cancers Well its to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pumpndump posts That this is a replacement for Keytruda which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80 % gross margins . But heres the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts Keytruda is allpurpose while the shit that SLS is producing is NOT_You need to be tested for the presence of WT1 antigen which is only done for blood disorderscancers . You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing_about it being usable for this source I know a few doctors . This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100 ... SLS drugs will barely target 1 % of that . Why do I say barely Well because that these drugs are given to specific people ... CDK9 is effective only for people with a certain less common mutation and GPS is given to my understanding to people in remission . So lets do simple math before I make you even more depressed USD 25B 1 % 250M lets be optimistic and say that 80 % are eligible 200M But wait it gets better ... however right now my heart is pumping pupils are needlepoint sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk ... low doses of ketamine . Unlocking my full potential Keytruda gets administered constantly unlike GPS which is like 20 injections . So that 200M you were looking at Yea its probably way lower . Now that weve got over the HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS lets focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEOs marketingdilution pattern . A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter . If youve ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE . 1 . The technical guy who actually knows shit 2 . The bullshitter whos liked but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if hes career driven will become a good CTO . The second one will become CEO . This is true for every profession reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell especially bullshit to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity . Its all a zerosum game . Nobody_wins especially not_the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like whitemonkeys are in China . The CEO SLS is no_different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter . How do you become a master bullshitter Ambiguity . Think of the 1 technical guy he will always be precise in his formulations because he knows what hes talking about . the 2 bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart . The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members read bagholders and MLM leaders parrot the actual but notfactual_message to the masses . Just look up the recent posts on bagholderpnd subreddits for SLS . Its all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team . After the share price jumps high the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion not_including the perpetual warrant inducement plan which alone makes acquisition very unlikely . The best part The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50 % shareholders want to lower his abovestandard pay . And theres a good reason hes getting such high cash bonuses he knows its all bullshit . All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired which is unlikely it will be sold at a discount and not_a premium . Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $ 4 a share ... with constantly increasing share count its amplifying the speed at which the companys valuation grows even though they still havent really presented anything substantial . Lets Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $ 4 Results of the REGAL study were postponed which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of Were still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study . Which is absolutely hilarious . Because it doesnt say anything about SLS specifically yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one it may be but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant The study includes both BAT best available treatment and the SLS drugs . The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones while the SLS patients have already died grim I know . Their argument Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever theyre saying . So why do people think its good news for SLS Because people think they understand statistics when they actually dont . Heck I studied it specialized in it as a mathematician ... and even I will never_dare to say that I fully understand statistics . Reality is that the delay might be negative neutral or positive . WHY Many factors come into patient selection The study isnt the typical lets pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests they come in different cohortsgroups You have high odds of selecting the good group that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment this can be 1015 % All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should which is a very misleading statistic and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people ... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years and that will average out so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not_enough to know if there is a statistical significance . Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis . A small sample size like this is prone to distortions follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not_which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn . But most importantly BAT for AML has significantly improved ... and by significantly I mean really significantly . The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 1012 months . Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS . Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production . Given their current free cash its more than likely that they will need to raise more money . So Why Are You Bearish Well I like to think of it in terms of probability uncertainty specifically conditional probability . Lets denote Pevent A as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening Asks yourself this which probability is higher 1 P Good News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad 2 P Bad News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad Which is more likely to be true 1 2 or 1 2 Im gon na go with the likelihood of bad news as probable ... This doesnt mean that the drug wont work I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no_matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections wont be as high as the current valuation . The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their lifesaving medication out there ... This isnt the age of biotech unfortunately . Hence Im buying puts . NOTE Im not_a biochemist I might be wrong and Im betting only money that Im willing to lose so dont follow blindly do your own DD . Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots . One last thing ... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement . My position is small because Im locked down in other trades sharing mostly because I like to do equity research EDIT To the existing and new bots out there the SLS cult and other believers yes I will double down if the stock price goes up Answering here since I received very nice DM requests ."

      "selftext": "TSLA is up over 2% in premarket trading, even though its Q4 delivery and production numbers came in below expectations. Here are the key figures from the release: Q4 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles (vs. estimates around 440,907) Q4 production: 434,358 vehicles (vs. projected \\~470,780) Full-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles On the surface, this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production, which would normally pressure the stock. Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open. A few possible reasons for the move: Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization, AI/robotics, autonomy, or longer-term narratives rather than near-term unit counts Positioning and short-term flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today’s session: Is this strength sustainable, or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully? Curious how others are reading this, bullish resilience, or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in?",

Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open . A few possible reasons for the move Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization AIrobotics autonomy or longerterm narratives rather than nearterm unit counts Positioning and shortterm flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today ’ s session Is this strength sustainable or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully Curious how others are reading this bullish resilience or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in"

      "selftext": "Hi all. I just started investing last May and really didn’t think much of it. I knew the basics but now my knowledge has really grown to where I feel I have many choices, but I really want to stick to the Boglehead philosophy of investing (I think it’s the most efficient and in many cases, the safest). With how the markets have been recently, my ETFs grew! I am currently only invested in VTI and VXUS. I now make biweekly contributions as well. I plan to stay invested for the long term. I was thinking of also investing in bonds and CDs. However! I’ve heard mixed reviews on this. Some say to not invest in bonds when you’re young because you should be more risky. However, I think the market is going to take a downturn and bonds might be a safe bet. I also was thinking of REITs and some ETFs focused on silver mining (due to the EV explosion). But then this takes away from a boglehead approach and becomes complicated. I also know that REITs are not efficient with taxes since the income from dividends can be high. Plus, I’m just also not experienced with investing. Most of my money is in a terrible HYSA, and while it’s safe, I believe it could be put to work. So, what are your thoughts on REITs and tapping into ETFs that might have some potential due to the EV and AI explosion?",

I am aware on how finding 2/3 ETFs and just accumulate and forget is a hands off approach for a long time investing for non professionals. Rebalancing once a year if needed and carry on. My portfolio has a bit of a mix of single stocks which have done good and don’t plan to liquidate, but I also don’t plan to buy in more besides a very small portion of my budget every now and then when a stock is undervalued and would still be coherent with my long investment horizon. I did some research and figured 3 ETFs that would give me the kind of exposure I feel most comfortable with, but while going through my portfolio ready to do my monthly purchase I realised the commission fee is on the higher end 3/4€) per purchase (IBKR). The three ETFs are XUSA, VWRA and DGRW, and purchasing once a month will erode a portion of my cash in a way I’m not too comfortable with. Question is: is it better to do bulk purchases, 1/2 per year, even if I don’t like cash idling in my account, or is there a set of ETFs which will do that same job without having such commission fee? My main concept is to have a limited exposure to US markets, between 35-45% of my portfolio.

This is where I learned about VACQ pre-RKLB and because of that I stacked 10k shares between Aug 2021 and Apr 2024. The rest is boomer stuff: QQQM, VOO, NVDA. I’m up about 1100% on NVDA, though I sold a decent chunk to buy more RKLB years ago. Also started nibbling KRKNF in the last month. My point is, if you actually read and think instead of just shitposting, there are some legit gems here. Happy New Year. Now give me my fkn flair: “See you, space cowboy…” RKLB $9000 LET’S RIDE 🚀",

It was an insanely turbulent year but thankful I ended green for the first time since 2021 (shorted most of the bull market 🫠) My biggest plays were full porting $BABA at $85 and riding most to $170. Going heavy $OPEN at $.80c but left a lot on the table after $3. I had 2000 shares of $IREN and sold at $10 which was a pivotal mistake. My last big play of the year was apeing $TSLA calls and some tech puts in November. Seeing how January starts off with most of MSM mega bullish and all of Fintwit expecting a downturn. I think $BIDU continues to go up and planning to go heavy there. I also like $RDW for space and drone theme as a moonshot. My other plays are robotics and software in names like $SYM $TER $PATH & $NOW $CRM. $NKE is due for a run back to $80 and think consumer stocks can bounce more. I also think I will short shares of $PLTR & $HOOD as a hedge. Let me know what plays you’re looking at and wish every one a happy new year and good luck in 2026!! 🙏",

      "selftext_processed": "Came back from the depths of hell in my individual accounts . Doubled my retirement accounts went from $ 5k to $ 30k in my Roth . It was an insanely turbulent year but thankful I ended green for the first time since 2021 shorted most of the bull market 🫠 My biggest plays were full porting $ BABA at $ 85 and riding most to $ 170 . Going heavy $ OPEN at $ .80c but left a lot on the table after $ 3 . I had 2000 shares of $ IREN and sold at $ 10 which was a pivotal mistake . My last big play of the year was apeing $ TSLA calls and some tech puts in November . Seeing how January starts off with most of MSM mega bullish and all of Fintwit expecting a downturn . I think $ BIDU continues to go up and planning to go heavy there . I also like $ RDW for space and drone theme as a moonshot . My other plays are robotics and software in names like $ SYM $ TER $ PATH $ NOW $ CRM . $ NKE is due for a run back to $ 80 and think consumer stocks can bounce more . I also think I will short shares of $ PLTR $ HOOD as a hedge . Let me know what plays you ’ re looking at and wish every one a happy new year and good luck in 2026 🙏"

Can pick up Jan 2027 $20C for $0.40. A 5% rise in underlying stock price should make these double. a 10% rise would triple and a 14% rise would make these quadruple. - Attractive valuation: trading at sub 7x EV / EBITDA which is less than peers (ET trades for 8.5x) Will keep you updated on all future trades.

Attractive valuation trading at sub 7x EV EBITDA which is less than peers ET trades for 8.5x Will keep you updated on all future trades . Goal for 2026 is $ 500k ."
