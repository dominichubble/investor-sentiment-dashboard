      "selftext": "My fellow brothers of Au, I have a potential hot take to discuss. What if the recent gold and silver drop was in fact market manipulation to scare away speculative retail investors creating a buying opportunity for institutional investors before prices jump to the stratosphere? I am convinced a kinetic war is coming between the US, Israel and Iran. This will further escalate polarization between those within American hegemony and BRICS. This could very well kickoff this weekend. If war does begin soon, those antagonistic to the US will start dumping US treasury bonds. Also, the US will be forced to print USD to high heaven to support the cost their of military adventurism. Large institutions cannot manipulate gold prices indefinitely, but they can create immediate price changes for their benefit. Assuming world elites do know this is coming, which they would undoubtedly know if it was, it makes sense for them to drive gold prices down, make skittish individual investors jump ship, then gobble up gold positions at deflated prices. There is simply no way that the prices of gold won’t soar to unprecedented levels if a major war begins. Iran is not Iraq. It is massive, mountainous, has a large well educated population able to withstand hardship, and has reasonable offensive capabilities. Also, this war is an existential threat to the state. They watched what happened to Iraq, Syria, Libya, etc., and know that they are entering a total war scenario. In which case, Iran would close the Strait of Hormuz and the Houthis would attack any ships they can in the Red Sea. I don’t need to overstate the effect this would have on world economies. There are just too many coincidences aligning. The new Fed chair being named today, the release of damning Epstein files, the fact that the new Fed chair is named in the damning Epstein files, it’s just too much at once. We also know that Netanyahu must continue to escalate because if life returns to normal in Israel, he faces very real culpability for his past corruption as well as conduct in Gaza. I am certain something is coming to a head and I fear bad times are inevitable. Gold is always seen as a safe refuge in turbulent times.",

      "title": "Macro Crisis, The Panic (at the disco), The...Solution? $USD, $YEN, crypto, GOLD (and precious metals $SLV, etc)",
      "selftext": "*I've been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff, safe haven dumps, and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding.* *Needless to say, it's been fascinating, and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean, and organising a structural engineer for my house on the \"next week\" backburner.* So what's new? **Key points:** \\- Fed Chairman Warsh appointment: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday. He is a known hawk; his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort, tending toward short-term interest rate drops while maintaining long-term raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric. \\- Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday, January 28, stating the U.S. is not planning to intervene, indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis. \\- The Yen reached a critical low point this week, testing the 158-159 range (closing Friday at 154.73). Any further drops become an un-ignorable domestic cost of living issue, and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160. \\- Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5% (down from 2.0%), virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate intervention, as rates remain pinned at 0.75%. \\- US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0% line (the 30-year ended Friday at 4.87%), a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse. \\- Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent; the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday, February 2, with auctions to follow. **The crossroads?** The carry trade needs to unwind, as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward, whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward. However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse. **Avenues?** A. The Fed could print USD to buy Yen, however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood, with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese. B. The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen, however recent economic figures (1.5% CPI) rule this out as a short-term possibility, and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind. C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency, via deploying USD cash reserves of \\~$160.4 Billion (held as deposits at the Fed), or selling T-bills/notes/bonds from their $1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen. As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now, leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages. A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries. Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets, spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance. This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings, crypto typically first, high risk stocks, and then precious metals (as seen in Friday's sharp gold sell-off). As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic, even for gold and silver, is seldom a good bet. Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail, as cash (USD/EUR/YEN) currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle. I suspect metals will find a floor, however commodities are not my turf so I'll let others do the deeper commentary there. **The remaining option?** There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover. The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF, strengthening the Yen, triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short sellers, and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned, whilst also not crushing the carry trade. Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed, the carry trade is not crushed and can slowly unwind, and global stock markets grind on higher. However what happens next remains to be seen, and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls. \\--- Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff safe haven dumps and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding . Needless to say its been fascinating and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean and organising a structural engineer for my house on the next week backburner . So whats new Key points Fed Chairman Warsh appointment President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday . He is a known hawk his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort tending toward shortterm interest rate drops while maintaining longterm raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric . Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday January 28 stating the U.S. is not_planning to intervene indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis . The Yen reached a critical low point this week testing the 158159 range closing Friday at 154.73 . Any further drops become an unignorable domestic cost of living issue and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160 . Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5 % down from 2.0 % virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan BoJ rate intervention as rates remain pinned at 0.75 % . US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0 % line the 30year ended Friday at 4.87 % a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse . Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday February 2 with auctions to follow . The crossroads The carry trade needs to unwind as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward . However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse . Avenues A . The Fed could print USD to buy Yen however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese . B . The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen however recent economic figures 1.5 % CPI rule this out as a shortterm possibility and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind . C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency via deploying USD cash reserves of $ 160.4 Billion held as deposits at the Fed or selling Tbillsnotesbonds from their $ 1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen . As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages . A Tbill shortterm Tnote and bond long term sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows and send US Bond yields soaring sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse particular in longer term treasuries . Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance . This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings crypto typically first high risk stocks and then precious metals as seen in Fridays sharp gold selloff . As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic even for gold and silver is seldom a good bet . Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail as cash USDEURYEN currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle . I suspect metals will find a floor however commodities are not_my turf so Ill let others do the deeper commentary there . The remaining option There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover . The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF strengthening the Yen triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short sellers and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned whilst also not_crushing the carry trade . Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed the carry trade is not_crushed and can slowly unwind and global stock markets grind on higher . However what happens next remains to be seen and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls . Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀"

It feels like you are supposed to do something all the time. But long term investing is mostly about patience and restraint. Understanding a business. Waiting. Doing nothing when nothing needs to be done. I sometimes feel like the tools themselves make this harder. They pull your attention to short term noise even when your strategy is long term. Maybe I am just tired. Or maybe the industry really forgot about people who want to invest slowly and think clearly. How do you deal with this.

Maybe I am just tired . Or maybe the industry really forgot about people who want to invest slowly and think clearly . How do you deal with this .

Novo Nordisk peaked at $142 in June 2024 and now trades around $62. Identical drawdowns. Yet Wall Street sees completely different futures. For Adobe, analysts forecast strong EPS growth, from flat $10-12 (2021-2024) to $23.44, a +40% YoY jump. Despite the 56% decline, 27 analysts see accelerating fundamentals ahead. For Novo Nordisk, the opposite. Historical revenue grew at 24% CAGR, EPS doubled at 35% CAGR. But analyst forecasts show a dramatic slowdown: revenue decelerating to just +5.1% YoY by 2025, EPS flatlining around $23 through 2027 (+2.7% YoY). Would love to hear your thoughts on why analysts have diverging opinions on the two stocks, even though both have fallen over 50%.

      "title": "A Timeline of Today's Silver Crash and its Beneficiaries",
      "selftext": "**TL,DR/Summary:** Today, the silver price dropped \\~30%, an event unseen in about 15 years. This may not be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9% and/or Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair. A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in today's sell-off. I gathered a timeline of recent events before today's historic crash in silver price. I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the US-dollar index gaining 0.9% is at least incomplete (and at most a smokescreen). **Timeline** * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group switches from a fixed-dollar margin per contract to a 9% percentage margin ([PDF source]( Hence, traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group announces new 100-ounce **cash-settled** futures * 27 Jan 2026: CME group increases the margin requirement from 9% to 11% ([PDF source]( forcing more traders to liquidate * 28 Jan 2026: ex-JPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50% drop in silver price ([source]( JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF * 29 Jan 2026: Still, silver hits an all time high at around $121 * 30 Jan 2026: Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair, and the USD index gains 0.9%. This is the narrative for silver plummeting \\~30% in one day. However, historically, hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere near a comparable sell-off **The COMEX Physical Silver Problem** CME group, as of 30 Jan 2026, reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces ([Silver Stocks Excel file]( The March silver future open interest, however, is roughly 490m ounces (source: [open interest 98k](#tradeDate=20260129), where each contract is for 5k ounces). Hence, it will be disastrous for COMEX if \\~22% of March future holders demand physical delivery. They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions. Likewise, bullion banks that sold these future contracts (and are short silver), would be able to maintain their short positions, avoid catastrophic losses, and gain massively. I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash. What's your take on this, and what does it mean for the silver price? Cheers -",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDRSummary Today the silver price dropped 30 % an event unseen in about 15 years . This may not_be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9 % andor Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair . A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in todays selloff . I gathered a timeline of recent events before todays historic crash in silver price . I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the USdollar index gaining 0.9 % is at least incomplete and at most a smokescreen . Timeline 13 Jan 2026 CME Group switches from a fixeddollar margin per contract to a 9 % percentage margin PDF source Hence traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price 13 Jan 2026 CME Group announces new 100ounce cashsettled futures 27 Jan 2026 CME group increases the margin requirement from 9 % to 11 % PDF source forcing more traders to liquidate 28 Jan 2026 exJPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50 % drop in silver price source JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF 29 Jan 2026 Still silver hits an all time high at around $ 121 30 Jan 2026 Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair and the USD index gains 0.9 % . This is the narrative for silver plummeting 30 % in one day . However historically hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere_near a comparable selloff The COMEX Physical Silver Problem CME group as of 30 Jan 2026 reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces Silver Stocks Excel file The March silver future open interest however is roughly 490m ounces source open interest 98ktrade Date20260129 where each contract is for 5k ounces . Hence it will be disastrous for COMEX if 22 % of March future holders demand physical delivery . They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions . Likewise bullion banks that sold these future contracts and are short silver would be able to maintain their short positions avoid catastrophic losses and gain massively . I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash . Whats your take on this and what does it mean for the silver price Cheers"

      "selftext": "Amateur investor here. I've done moderately well this past year, mostly just the market doing what it's doing, but I've made a few good choices and some other \"learning experiences\" I'm wondering, how can I improve my strategy for stop losses while capitalizing on the greatest amount of gain possible? I don't have the time or commitment to watch my holdings every minute. I want to have a better system of when I enter a position, setting up appropriate stops and also conditional trades so that I can take advantage of upswings but don't get burnt by sell offs. Is it advisable strategy to set up conditional trades such as this: if you enter at $100 for example, set up a cobditional trade such that if the stock dips past - 3% below it's 30-day high, it triggers a market sale. Something like that? Or what conditional trades do you use when you enter a position?",

Ive done moderately well this past year mostly just the market doing what its doing but Ive made a few good choices and some other learning experiences Im wondering how can I improve my strategy for stop losses while capitalizing on the greatest amount of gain possible I dont have the time or commitment to watch my holdings every minute . I want to have a better system of when I enter a position setting up appropriate stops and also conditional trades so that I can take advantage of upswings but dont get burnt by sell offs . Is it advisable strategy to set up conditional trades such as this if you enter at $ 100 for example set up a cobditional trade such that if the stock dips past 3 % below its 30day high it triggers a market sale . Something like that Or what conditional trades do you use when you enter a position"

      "selftext": "I track my percentage return from dividends as a percentage. Stock prices changes and so, the percentage changes. I track the earnings percentage in two columns; one for my purchase price and one for the rate at the current day's price. Weirdly, I view my dividend annual interest rate differently, depending on whether the stock price is up or down. For example, I bought CVX at $136 last June when the rate was 5%. At today's price ($176.90), the rate is 3.87%. I still \"think\" that my \"original\" money is earning 5%. On the other hand, I bought RA at $21.18, now at $13.02 but I \"think\" that my earnings rate is 6.69%, even though someone buying today would be earning 10.88% per year. My original RA investment, much of it lost, is earning at the lower rate. Should I be thinking of things differently? It doesn't seem to make much sense to use both the \"my cost\" rate and the \"current price rate, depending on whether I \"won\" or \"lost\" on the original purchase price.",

One of my research strategy is the management quality. I lost faith in Elon and his cult following group years ago but was too afraid to pull the trigger with seeing my account up \\~170% on my position and the FOMO of Robotics and Robotaxis. Truth is I can no longer go to sleep trusting my money in a CEO that is unreliable, committed securities fraud in the past and trying to plug in his other companies under the Tesla hood. Not to mention the financials. The market does not make sense anymore but I can. I might regrett it but Tesla is no longer the company it used to be and I can no longer overlook the finanical red flags.... EDIT 1: Many Elon boys think I sold out of spite for their leader. I don’t give a fuck about him. To attribute the output of an entire workforce to one figurehead is disrespectful to the engineers. I just literally ran models, looked at earnings reports, data, demand curves for Tesla, nothing supports my original thesis. I beg you before fighting me in the comments and riding Elon’s D, show me any financial metrics that prove your point. EDIT: THANKS FOR THE AWARDS",

One of my research strategy is the management quality . I lost faith in Elon and his cult following group years ago but was too afraid to pull the trigger with seeing my account up 170 % on my position and the FOMO of Robotics and Robotaxis . Truth is I can no_longer go to sleep trusting my money in a CEO that is unreliable committed securities fraud in the past and trying to plug in his other companies under the Tesla hood . Not_to mention the financials . The market does not_make sense anymore but I can . I might regrett it but Tesla is no_longer the company it used to be and I can no_longer overlook the finanical red flags .... EDIT 1 Many Elon boys think I sold out of spite for their leader . I don ’ t give a fuck about him . To attribute the output of an entire workforce to one figurehead is disrespectful to the engineers . I just literally ran models looked at earnings reports data demand curves for Tesla nothing_supports my original thesis . I beg you before fighting me in the comments and riding Elon ’ s D show me any financial metrics that prove your point . EDIT THANKS FOR THE AWARDS"

      "selftext": "Briefings from Goldman Sachs: Gold has capped off a huge 2025 rally with a blazing start to 2026. While prices declined in early trading on Friday, Anshul Sehgal, global co-head of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, says the precious metal could continue to rise. The main driver of the move has been global central banks’ shift from the US dollar to precious metals, Sehgal says. “These are tiny markets compared to global stocks or fixed income, so the smallest change in demand makes prices go parabolic. Sehgal that only about 5% of the world’s gold is currently held by speculators. “If a central bank decides they want to pivot away from the dollar and own more gold, that is going to move the price quite violently. Which is what we're observing.” For this reason, Sehgal is skeptical of arguments that gold is currently being driven by speculative mania. “We think this is a multi-decade trajectory,\" he says. He adds that gold “barely moved” from 2010 to 2020 even as growth-oriented stocks surged, which means the recent move can partially be categorized as a catch-up. “Do we expect gold to continue to appreciate exponentially as it has? No. But we’re not fussed about there being a lot of froth when it comes to precious metals,” he says.",

Possible catalysts: \\- new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar \\- iran war de-escalation \\- unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation: the price is the consensus reached by many different players, most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading.

TL;DR: US specular’s job is to predict the asian metal market driven by fundamentals, so large moves during nyse trading hours are a false signal, serious price discovery is going to happen with American markets closed.

Possible catalysts new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar iran war deescalation unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation the price is the consensus reached by many different players most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading . They either panic sold or got margin called deepening the crash . In the Asian market however there are institutions and governments who have a strategic or long term reason to buy especially when they get a discount . They will be voting and primary driver of the monday opening price since time zone is ahead for asia . So I am expecting a gap up and I bought both GLD and SLV calls right before close on Friday . TLDR US specular ’ s job is to predict the asian metal market driven by fundamentals so large moves during nyse trading hours are a false signal serious price discovery is going to happen with American markets closed .

I used \\[thefinbase\\]( to pull together this data for my risk analysis before I buy this stock and \\[tradingview\\]( for financial information it has the best UI . No affiliation with these two just revealing my sources. Now let’s get going: Balance Sheet Shifting Toward Less Flexible Assets Property, plant, and equipment increased nearly 50% in a single year (from \\\\\\~$155B to \\\\\\~$230B). That's a massive tilt toward long duration, non liquid assets. Meanwhile, depreciation jumped from $22B to $34B. In a sector where hardware can become obsolete quickly, this concentration in physical infrastructure creates impairment exposure if tech refresh cycles accelerate. Some Interesting Liability Movement \"Other Current Liabilities\" increased 45% year over year. Without detailed disclosure, this likely includes unearned cloud billings and similar obligations. Worth monitoring because rapid buildup in prepayment dependency can distort cash flow timing if customer behavior shifts. The Segment Concentration Factor Intelligent Cloud now drives roughly 40% of revenue with 29% growth, while More Personal Computing actually declined 3%. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean any cloud cyclicality hits the overall business harder than it would have five years ago. The Sentiment Disconnect Despite record profits, shares declined after strong Q2 results. When markets sell the news on beat and raise quarters, it often signals expectations have gotten ahead of near term reality. None of this means the investment thesis is broken. Microsoft remains a dominant business. But as value investors, we're supposed to see what others miss and understand what we're actually paying for at current multiples. Even with these risks I still think it's a good stock to buy, especially in its role as the AI boom continues. What do you think ?",

      "selftext": "I am an ignorant anonymous, I surely know less than you, but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today. **What happened today?** Everything went to shit: gold, silver, major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit. **What does this mean?** The market received a necessary correction. After gold and silver rose savagely these days, a lot of last-minute leveraged money was absorbed. I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop: 1. **Options Expiration:** Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed. With gold at **5,500 USD**, profit-taking was factual. Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits, and thus generated downward pressure. 2. **Trump's move with Kevin Warsh:** Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed. On paper, he is a \"HAWK\" (strong dollar, high rates, and low inflation). That's why the market ran to bonds and punished stocks/gold for fear of liquidity being cut. **My opinion:** Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not long ago. For me, Warsh is a puppet: they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House. Under this thesis, when he comes to power in May, Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending. The dollar will continue to lose value, gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks, and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate (congratulations if you held emerging market bonds). But if you don't believe me even in the worst-case scenario, boys: the decay of Fiat is not fixed with a change of names. Hold your equities and don't let yourselves be scared.",

What happened today Everything went to shit gold silver major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit . What does this mean The market received a necessary correction . After gold and silver rose savagely these days a lot of lastminute leveraged money was absorbed . I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop 1 . Options Expiration Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed . With gold at 5500 USD profittaking was factual . Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits and thus generated downward pressure . 2 . Trumps move with Kevin Warsh Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed . On paper he is a HAWK strong dollar high rates and low inflation . Thats why the market ran to bonds and punished stocksgold for fear of liquidity being cut .

      "selftext": "I’d a few weeks ago before the CFO stepped down made a post telling people to buy TTD. I did a post like this because the financials looked unbelievably good for that price. I’d originally thought it was beat down and far over corrected….Then I got to witness first handedly how incompetent the CEO Is. What happened? The CFO suddenly stepped down… management reiterated their financials but with lack luster detail. It dropped 20percent in 5 days. So what did management do? Well I sent and Email asking about the situation and if everything is going well with the company and I’d gotten 0 response within 2 business days. Additionally the CEO who once said “communication with investors is key” is MIA as if the company doesn’t matter I learned an important lesson that I think is value-able Who the CEO is can make a company or break one. Jeff Green The CEO is worth 2.6Billion dollars. TTD has a 15B market cap that just took a 80percent haircut from the highs. Do you think Jeff The Douche Green bought any shares? Nope in the past 2 years all he’s done is sold. This is why I sold out of my position upon realizing my mistake. For Reference if you’re the owner of your own business and you have 260,000$ and you truly believe your company is worth far more than this you’d buy of course. You can see the financials and should be confident in how you’re operating the company…. Now imagine me as the CEO and owner refusing to even purchase even 260$ of shares. That is Jeff Green. Jeff Green is an example of a CEO that looks at the business as a job. How unbelievably disappointing pathetically and selfish Edit: this is the 3rd CFO to step down, if the CFO is stepping down and Multi Billionaire Jeff Green who can see the financials isn’t buying any stock it tell you everything you need to know. ***AI “As of early 2026, Jeffrey T. Green, CEO of The Trade Desk, has an estimated net worth between $2.3 billion and over $6 billion. His wealth is primarily derived from his ownership of The Trade Desk (TTD) stock and his massive 2022 stock option package”***",

I did a post like this because the financials looked unbelievably good for that price . I ’ d originally thought it was beat down and far over corrected….Then I got to witness first handedly how incompetent the CEO Is . What happened The CFO suddenly stepped down… management reiterated their financials but with lack luster detail . It dropped 20percent in 5 days . So what did management do Well I sent and Email asking about the situation and if everything is going well with the company and I ’ d gotten 0 response within 2 business days . Additionally the CEO who once said “ communication with investors is key ” is MIA as if the company doesn ’ t matter I learned an important lesson that I think is valueable Who the CEO is can make a company or break one . Jeff Green The CEO is worth 2.6Billion dollars . TTD has a 15B market cap that just took a 80percent haircut from the highs . Do you think Jeff The Douche Green bought any shares Nope in the past 2 years all he ’ s done is sold . This is why I sold out of my position upon realizing my mistake . For Reference if you ’ re the owner of your own business and you have 260000 $ and you truly believe your company is worth far more than this you ’ d buy of course . You can see the financials and should be confident in how you ’ re operating the company… . Now imagine me as the CEO and owner refusing to even purchase even 260 $ of shares . That is Jeff Green . Jeff Green is an example of a CEO that looks at the business as a job . How unbelievably disappointing pathetically and selfish Edit this is the 3rd CFO to step down if the CFO is stepping down and Multi Billionaire Jeff Green who can see the financials isn ’ t buying any stock it tell you everything you need to know . AI “ As of early 2026 Jeffrey T. Green CEO of The Trade Desk has an estimated net worth between $ 2.3 billion and over $ 6 billion . His wealth is primarily derived from his ownership of The Trade Desk TTD stock and his massive 2022 stock option package ”"

Wallstreet tends to hate uncertainty so people were hedging their positions with hard assets, precious metals, while the decision on Fed chair was still being made. Now that it is here, we see a historic single day drop in hard assets. Could this be the markets shifting away from metals to be put back into equities now that a new chair has been named? I think Wallstreet is bullish on Warsh and still bullish on tech despite some uncertainties (now one less).",

Wallstreet tends to hate uncertainty so people were hedging their positions with hard assets precious metals while the decision on Fed chair was still being made . Now that it is here we see a historic single day drop in hard assets . Could this be the markets shifting away from metals to be put back into equities now that a new chair has been named I think Wallstreet is bullish on Warsh and still bullish on tech despite some uncertainties now one less ."

      "selftext": "When my husband died a few years ago, I became sole owner of his brokerage account. He was pretty casual about his stocks and didn't have the date of acquisition for many of them. He was a \"buy and hold\" guy, or \"inherit and hold.\" Upon my death, the account will go to a charity that was important to my husband. We were each other's second spouse. He had no children. I transfer regular earnings to my account and use the money for whatever I want -- living expenses, house repairs, investment. Occasionally, however, one of his stocks will disappear and leave a pile of money in the sweep account. (Yes, the company is acquired by another entity or whatever.) I take that money and invest in other stocks for his account, using my own research and recommendations from the brokerkage. Here's my question: Should I do some research to find out when he acquired the stocks for which I have no date of acquisition? If so, how would I do that? I know that he acquired some of the stocks in the Seventies, and some he probably had had since he was a child, so they are almost certainly considered long-term investments.

      "selftext": "Reddit (RDDT) stock has recently been experiencing volatility following a dip from a recent high, driven by analyst concerns over 2026 ad growth and competition. Despite this, bullish sentiment remains, with some analysts setting price targets up to $320 based on strong user growth and AI integrations. *“driven by analyst concerns over 2026 ad growth and competition”* What like TikTok? The app everyone is now leaving for a lot of different reasons? Or do you mean Snap? The app that’s been dead for the last several years? I’ll go ahead and leave Meta alone because I don’t think I even need to bother with that one. Gold and Silver sold off today with the dollar rising as there seems to be some optimism for the new Fed Chair, Walsh (who knows, I’m not taking a stance on that one.) The point here is there seems to be optimism for 2026, how do you take a stance on declining ad growth? However, between Reddit ads, its current presence among search queries, AI, targeted interests among users, the company seems to be focusing more and more on AI data licensing and improved search UI. Yea, there’s also a new verified profile feature which I guess can be great in the long run. I guess it seems like this sell off is way overblown. There is also a lot of negative sentiment across Reddit about Reddit stock (I know that Reddit sentiment should be an index, lol.) Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5, 2026. This is an honest question because perhaps I’ve just missed something a bit more alarming? **P.S.** To those who are about to shout “it’s nothing but bots!” - yea there’s bots in all of them, however you’d be surprised how many are *not* bots. This gives me the same vibes of “that must be AI!” when it actually isn’t, haha. Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit to find answers anymore. I’ve witnessed people scrolling to the Reddit answer for their question on platforms like Google. Then, it’s funny to see their questions get answered and then take interest in an ad they catch while doing so[.](",

Despite this bullish sentiment remains with some analysts setting price targets up to $ 320 based on strong user growth and AI integrations . “ driven by analyst concerns over 2026 ad growth and competition ” What like TikTok The app everyone is now leaving for a lot of different reasons Or do you mean Snap The app that ’ s been dead for the last several years I ’ ll go ahead and leave Meta alone because I don ’ t think I even need to bother with that one . Gold and Silver sold off today with the dollar rising as there seems to be some optimism for the new Fed Chair Walsh who knows I ’ m not_taking a stance on that one . The point here is there seems to be optimism for 2026 how do you take a stance on declining ad growth However between Reddit ads its current presence among search queries AI targeted interests among users the company seems to be focusing more and more on AI data licensing and improved search UI . Yea there ’ s also a new verified profile feature which I guess can be great in the long run . I guess it seems like this sell off is way overblown . There is also a lot of negative sentiment across Reddit about Reddit stock I know that Reddit sentiment should be an index lol . Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5 2026 . This is an honest question because perhaps I ’ ve just missed something a bit more alarming P.S . To those who are about to shout “ it ’ s nothing_but bots ” yea there ’ s bots in all of them however you ’ d be surprised how many are not bots . This gives me the same vibes of “ that must be AI ” when it actually isn ’ t haha . Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit to find answers anymore . I ’ ve witnessed people scrolling to the Reddit answer for their question on platforms like Google . Then it ’ s funny to see their questions get answered and then take interest in an ad they catch while doing so ."

I researched and made this PF for me: 70% ACWX - Developed Markets ex usa + Emerging markets 30% CSPX - Similar to S&P500. With this my idea is to reduce US concentration in my PF because World ETFs include >60% US. But the issue is ACWX is Nasdaq based ETF. Is anyone aware of any other alternative UCITs for ACWX ?? I know I can replicate ACWX via/from EXUS + EIMI but that would require a little more monitoring down the line. ACWX would have served the purpose just right but the only issue is that it is US domiciled. TLDR; I have 2 questions: 1) Is there any ACWX alternative, non US domiciled UCIT on IBKR? 2) How do I buy gold on ibkr? best etf?",

      "title": "Trust investment claims outperformance vs indexes, looking for advice",
      "selftext": "I’m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I’m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense. Background: I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next \\~3 years. The trust is administered by a large, reputable law firm, and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates. From everything I can tell, this is a legitimate, professional setup and not anything sketchy. The trust uses an outside active equity manager. The proposed long-term allocation is roughly 80% equities and 20% cash (short-term needs), with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into \\~30–40 individual stocks. The stated goal is long-term investing with a “defensive” tilt: high-quality companies, low debt, strong balance sheets, some international exposure, and selective themes (e.g., infrastructure, electrification). The annual fee is \\~1.2% of the entire trust value (not just the invested portion). This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight. Trading costs are small, but the 1.2% applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash. I asked for historical performance, and I was shown a model trust portfolio (not my specific account) covering roughly 1998–2025. According to that report: • Total portfolio (stocks + bonds + cash): \\~8.3% annualized • Equity portion alone: \\~11.6% annualized Over the same period: • S&P 500: \\~9.4% • MSCI World: \\~8.3% The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes, while also being more defensive. However, once I factor in the 1.2% annual fee on the full trust, the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly \\~7.1%. That puts it roughly in line with (or slightly below) a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio, and clearly below the S&P 500 over the same horizon. Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach: • Index funds are “not necessarily low risk” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks. • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration. • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure. • The strategy has historically “participated less” during market declines. My concerns: • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing long-term risk. • The performance shown is from a model portfolio, which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias. • The equity outperformance looks good gross, but once the full trust fee is applied, it largely disappears. • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk, it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result. • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years, I’m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the long-term portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases. I’m not claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here. The trustee is experienced, properly credentialed, and works at a well-known firm. My question is more about the math and the assumptions. For those with experience in investing, finance, or trusts: • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test? • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this? • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns? • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for? Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I ’ m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense . Background I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next 3 years . The trust is administered by a large reputable law firm and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates . From everything I can tell this is a legitimate professional setup and not_anything sketchy . The trust uses an outside active equity manager . The proposed longterm allocation is roughly 80 % equities and 20 % cash shortterm needs with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into 30–40 individual stocks . The stated goal is longterm investing with a “ defensive ” tilt highquality companies low debt strong balance sheets some international exposure and selective themes e.g . infrastructure electrification . The annual fee is 1.2 % of the entire trust value not just the invested portion . This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight . Trading costs are small but the 1.2 % applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash . I asked for historical performance and I was shown a model trust portfolio not my specific account covering roughly 1998–2025 . According to that report • Total portfolio stocks bonds cash 8.3 % annualized • Equity portion alone 11.6 % annualized Over the same period • SP 500 9.4 % • MSCI World 8.3 % The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes while also being more defensive . However once I factor in the 1.2 % annual fee on the full trust the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly 7.1 % . That puts it roughly in line with or slightly below a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio and clearly below the SP 500 over the same horizon . Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach • Index funds are “ not necessarily low risk ” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks . • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration . • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure . • The strategy has historically “ participated less ” during market declines . My concerns • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing longterm risk . • The performance shown is from a model portfolio which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias . • The equity outperformance looks good gross but once the full trust fee is applied it largely disappears . • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result . • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years I ’ m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the longterm portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases . I ’ m not_claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here . The trustee is experienced properly credentialed and works at a wellknown firm . My question is more about the math and the assumptions . For those with experience in investing finance or trusts • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives ."

      "title": "Dollar Crashing. My Criticism of Public Perception",
      "selftext": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this: The dollar has always been crashing, but it really depends on what frame of view by which you're looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you. That's where we can have a debate. As you know, we've seen headlines about the dollar collapse, and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends. But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider: What makes this 'crash' any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced? Here's what you'll see folks point to: \\- Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency. \\-Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights. \\-Recent inflation has been exceptional, where aggregate prices are 26% higher today than in 2019-2020. \\-The DXY, a measure of our currency relative to a basket of first-world nations, has come down considerably \\-Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control This is what I'd like to point to: Nothing changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new. let's look at the above talking points one-by-one. **1) Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency & 2) The DXY has come down considerably** In recent history, it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade. Is this new? No. The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline. We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar, as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was *artificially* being stymied. Just like the OPEC-mandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s, we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar. Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage. You may argue \"But did our money supply not increase??\". The answer is yes. It did. But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world. Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty. Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not seen in decades. It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized. The advent of Trump's tariffs, like him or not, did add some fuel to the fire. Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here. China being a large proponent to this. Overall, you'll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runner-up. **Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights** The price increases of Gold/Silver have been often misread as \"this must mean the value of the dollar is falling\", when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is self-fulfilling. If people believe the sky is falling, they'll buy bunkers. It's not that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling. I've already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver, so I'll not stay too long on this one, but I want to point out that in the coming months, you may see the price stagnate then climb higher. You may also see it come crashing back down. Both events are equally likely. Fundamentally, however, I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not led by central banking or any monetary authority. We can check money flows. When we do this, we find that A) there's already been an industrial shortage for silver and B) This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own. If you use fund inflows to exchange-traded products backed by gold and silver, you see they've gone up by 20-30 fold. That's not nothing. That's behavioral and not fundamental. But let's go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things: 1) **current and expected CPI** 2) **Long term treasury yields** \\-The CPI expectation hovers at 2.7-3.2%. This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 50-60 years. As for Long term treasury yield, we use this figure because I don't want to open myself up to someone saying \"Well, the fed has been buying treasuries, so that decreases yields\". They would be right, but 10 and 30-yr terms are the exception. Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates. If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally, we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30-yr terms, pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations. We'd also see a really difficult auction. We haven't seen either. Right now, yields are 160 Bps below the 60-year average, and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong; evidenced by the 'bid-to-cover' ratio, which is actually within a normal range at **2.55**. **Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control** THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely. Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending. As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases, it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand. I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change. However, some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable Debt/GDP ratio. This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically under-paces the rate in which we accumulate public debt. Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the \"Dollar Crash\" concern: QE (Quantitative Easing). QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits. This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks. **So where are we really?** It's complicated. And the news doesn't help. The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s. I'll not lie to you and say everything is okay, but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not going away. We have a real problem with debt. It's growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt, each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nation's treasury. But here's the detail we can't miss: Our economy is capitalistic, not communistic. In a capitalist country, the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace. And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money, that skews inflation recognition. Not for capital assets but for consumables. We've seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras. 1) the easy-money policy when debt was near 0%. 2) During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the top-end of the economy. Hence the K-shaped recovery. This created asset inflation, and we can call it asset inflation because of how P/E ratios, (adjusted for earnings growth), have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages. Some of this is structural. Companies, today, are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history. That can pull-forward tomorrow's pricing to today. But that's an incomplete story. If we look at capital assets, they've outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply. That's where the **dollar's value 'plunging'** shows up. This leads me back to my overall argument. The dollar crisis shows up depending on where you're looking. Capping it all off, I'll leave you with this scenario: Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim. And let's say I print off $10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself (I would). By every measure, M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50%, but does this mean the dollar's purchasing power has been cut by 1/3? No. It's the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollar's loss of purchasing power. If I started to then spend that $10 Trillion, buy all the food from the shelves, feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price I'm paying, then you'd see inflation. **The rule:** In a true currency crisis, you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transaction-related friction. For many countries, companies and individuals, that currency is still the US Dollar. When you have dollars, convert your savings into productive assets. Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery. No other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does.",

      "selftext_processed": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this The dollar has always been crashing but it really depends on what frame of view by which youre looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you . Thats where we can have a debate . As you know weve seen headlines about the dollar collapse and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends . But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider What makes this crash any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced Heres what youll see folks point to Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights . Recent inflation has been exceptional where aggregate prices are 26 % higher today than in 20192020 . The DXY a measure of our currency relative to a basket of firstworld nations has come down considerably Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control This is what Id like to point to Nothing_changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new . lets look at the above talking points onebyone . 1 Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency 2 The DXY has come down considerably In recent history it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade . Is this new No_The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline . We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was artificially being stymied . Just like the OPECmandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar . Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage . You may argue But did our money supply not_increase . The answer is yes . It did . But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world . Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty . Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not_seen in decades . It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized . The advent of Trumps tariffs like him or not_did add some fuel to the fire . Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here . China being a large proponent to this . Overall youll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runnerup . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights The price increases of GoldSilver have been often misread as this must mean the value of the dollar is falling when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is selffulfilling . If people believe the sky is falling theyll buy bunkers . Its not_that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling . Ive already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver so Ill not_stay too long on this one but I want to point out that in the coming months you may see the price stagnate then climb higher . You may also see it come crashing back down . Both events are equally likely . Fundamentally however I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not_led by central banking or any monetary authority . We can check money flows . When we do this we find that A theres already been an industrial shortage for silver and B This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own . If you use fund inflows to exchangetraded products backed by gold and silver you see theyve gone up by 2030 fold . Thats not_nothing . Thats behavioral and not_fundamental . But lets go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things 1 current and expected CPI 2 Long term treasury yields The CPI expectation hovers at 2.73.2 % . This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 5060 years . As for Long term treasury yield we use this figure because I dont want to open myself up to someone saying Well the fed has been buying treasuries so that decreases yields . They would be right but 10 and 30yr terms are the exception . Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates . If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30yr terms pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations . Wed also see a really difficult auction . We havent seen either . Right now yields are 160 Bps below the 60year average and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong evidenced by the bidtocover ratio which is actually within a normal range at 2.55 . Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely . Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending . As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand . I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change . However some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable DebtGDP ratio . This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically underpaces the rate in which we accumulate public debt . Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the Dollar Crash concern QE Quantitative Easing . QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits . This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks . So where are we really Its complicated . And the news doesnt help . The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s . Ill not_lie to you and say everything is okay but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not_going away . We have a real problem with debt . Its growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nations treasury . But heres the detail we cant miss Our economy is capitalistic not_communistic . In a capitalist country the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace . And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money that skews inflation recognition . Not_for capital assets but for consumables . Weve seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras . 1 the easymoney policy when debt was near 0 % . 2 During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the topend of the economy . Hence the Kshaped recovery . This created asset inflation and we can call it asset inflation because of how PE ratios adjusted for earnings growth have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages . Some of this is structural . Companies today are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history . That can pullforward tomorrows pricing to today . But thats an incomplete story . If we look at capital assets theyve outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply . Thats where the dollars value plunging shows up . This leads me back to my overall argument . The dollar crisis shows up depending on where youre looking . Capping it all off Ill leave you with this scenario Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim . And lets say I print off $ 10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself I would . By every measure M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50 % but does this mean the dollars purchasing power has been cut by 13 No_Its the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollars loss of purchasing power . If I started to then spend that $ 10 Trillion buy all the food from the shelves feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price Im paying then youd see inflation . The rule In a true currency crisis you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transactionrelated friction . For many countries companies and individuals that currency is still the US Dollar . When you have dollars convert your savings into productive assets . Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery . No_other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does ."

      "selftext": "We often hear the standard advice: \"Own more bonds to stay safe.\" Or the classic \"100 minus your age\" rule. But as a data-focused analyst, I’ve always found the standard economic models (like Mean-Variance Optimization) frustrating because they fail to mathematically support long-term stock holding. Standard models penalize stocks for \"upside volatility,\" even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation. I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the *Journal of Finance* titled **\"Bond versus Stock: Investors' Age and Risk Taking\"** (Bali, Demirtas, Levy, Wolf). It uses a framework called **Almost Stochastic Dominance (ASD)** to prove that for rational investors, the \"risk\" of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon. Here is the breakdown of the data (covering U.S. markets 1941–2000): **1. The Short Run (1 Month) is a Coin Flip** If your horizon is 30 days, stocks are not \"investing\" but they are gambling. * **Dominance:** None. Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks beating bonds is only **\\~67%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" (the statistical likelihood of regret) is high at \\~28%. **2. The \"Efficiency\" Shift (48 Months)** The paper found that once you hold for 4 years, the efficient frontier shifts aggressively. * At a 48-month horizon, only portfolios with **80% or more equities** are considered efficient. * If you hold >20% bonds for a 4-year period, you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no rational utility gain. **3. The Magic Number (60 Months)** This is where the \"Time Diversification\" argument becomes irrefutable. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits **\\~98–99%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" shrinks to a negligible **0.24%**. **The Takeaway:** We often confuse \"Volatility\" with \"Risk.\" * In the short term (1 month), volatility IS risk. * In the long term (60 months), volatility is just the mechanism of compounding. If you have a 5-year horizon, \"playing it safe\" with heavy bond exposure isn't actually safe but it is mathematically irrational. So my question is, based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100% in stocks? :)",

My understanding is Warsh at one point advocated for tighter Fed policy, but his views now align with the current administration's. With how much Trump has been pressuring Jerome Powell to lower rates, regularly berating him in front of the media, why do market participants believe Warsh will do anything other than lower rates aggressively? Why would Trump nominate a chair that will defy his demands to quickly and drastically cut rates?",

The agency notes that the December increase in prices for final demand can be traced to a 0.7-percent advance in the index for final demand services. Prices for final demand goods were unchanged. Fed Chair Powell mentioned that they expect the Core PCE Y/Y to be around 3.0% in December. This PPI report is unlikely to trigger big market moves as we await next week's data, with the US NFP report being the main highlight. The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and that's unlikely to change much with this report. The Fed upgraded the current economic outlook in their last policy statement to reflect the improvement in the data. In December, the Fed projected just one cut in 2026, so we will need more labour market deterioration or bigger than expected fall in inflation to see them going faster on rate cuts.",

The agency notes that the December increase in prices for final demand can be traced to a 0.7percent advance in the index for final demand services . Prices for final demand goods were unchanged . Fed Chair Powell mentioned that they expect the Core PCE YY to be around 3.0 % in December . This PPI report is unlikely to trigger big market moves as we await next weeks data with the US NFP report being the main highlight . The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and thats unlikely to change much with this report . The Fed upgraded the current economic outlook in their last policy statement to reflect the improvement in the data . In December the Fed projected just one cut in 2026 so we will need more labour market deterioration or bigger than expected fall in inflation to see them going faster on rate cuts ."

Second question - I’m wondering I’m too tilted in one direction / if I should be using this $ to begin balancing out my weighted averages. I’ve basically just been on autopilot buying VTI + a little QQQM the past 2 years. Maybe more in international? Open to suggestions here. Third question - I’m wondering what the general consensus on investing securities into your Roth is? In 2025 I accidentally put GOOG and NVDA into my Roth instead of a separate brokerage account I have. I know there’s overlap with VTI and QQQM but I’m hesitant to sell it off & redistribute it or withdraw to allocate towards my brokerage due to a lack of understanding the rules. Excuse me if these questions come across naive, very much a set it and forget it type of investor. Thanks in advance :)",

      "selftext": "I received many DMs after my [first post]( about $SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected, so here it is. **BACKGROUND:** Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee. In-app prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat+. So I compiled data from 80 respondents (37k+ friends in total) to estimate Snap’s earning potential. **THE GOOD NEWS:** I remain confident that subscription-based revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter, which should result in \\~12.5% growth in run-rate revenue and \\~25% bump in enterprise value expectation (though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot) **THE BAD NEWS:** The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat+ subs will not be realized as Q4 revenue, but will instead build rapidly over the next year. This is because of **(1)** steep first-month signup discounts, **(2)** in-app prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter, and **(3)** the fact that “Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription” (from 10-Q). (That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won’t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4). Also, Apple’s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year. **METHOD:** (See Images 3 and 4) I broke down user count by age group and location (US, EU, INDIA/ROW) using DAU reports from the 10Q. I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics. I multiplied the two matrices together, summed to get a demographic-weighted average of DAUs who are subscribed, then multiplied by total DAUs. I also multiplied by a “Zombie factor” to account for inactive users on respondents’ friend lists. This leads me to the 100% increase figure with assumptions: * Of the average user’s friend list, 40% are DAU, 40% are MAU, and 20% are inactive. * People over age 35 (making up 30% of the user base) are completely ignored. * $2/mo subscription plans are completely ignored. **Assumption analysis** INDIA: India accounts for \\~40% of users, so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight. I spent 5 hours on Azar (like Omegle but more popular in India), but I couldn’t get a single Indian user to give me their data (though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat+). So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 1/10 of those in the US for the same age group. I think this is reasonable because Snapchat+ is 50 Rupees per month in India, corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity. DOUBLE-COUNTING: I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed (as opposed to the friend-count-weighted method I used in my first post). **NOTE:** Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low (0.29), so this may not be necessary. INACTIVE USERS: Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis. Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs , I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap+ per DAU metric. Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs. As a 21-year old, I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this: A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity. Also, criminals love Snapchat for self-deleting texts. Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends. **OTHER NOTES:** I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap+ friends. I attribute this to an error in sampling; these users assumed that, because they were sent to a different page than was shown, their Snap+ friend count must be 0. This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection. Snap doesn’t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q, instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards. I won’t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid. Schwab was showing me +$19k in (totally fake) unrealized P&L on Tuesday based on mid-to-market rates (the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x). If anyone knows how to change this, please comment below. **Safe to say I’m down a lot. But I haven’t sold anything.** Holding till Feb 4th. Cross your fingies for me. PS: See the raw data [Here]( I'd love to see your analysis! PPS: If you know any 35-yr-olds or Indians who use Snapchat, please ask them for their data and comment it below.",

      "selftext_processed": "I received many DMs after my first post about $ SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected so here it is . BACKGROUND Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee . Inapp prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat . So I compiled data from 80 respondents 37k friends in total to estimate Snap ’ s earning potential . THE GOOD NEWS I remain confident that subscriptionbased revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter which should result in 12.5 % growth in runrate revenue and 25 % bump in enterprise value expectation though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot THE BAD NEWS The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat subs will not_be realized as Q4 revenue but will instead build rapidly over the next year . This is because of 1 steep firstmonth signup discounts 2 inapp prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter and 3 the fact that “ Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription ” from 10Q . That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won ’ t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4 . Also Apple ’ s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year . METHOD See Images 3 and 4 I broke down user count by age group and location US EU INDIAROW using DAU reports from the 10Q . I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics . I multiplied the two matrices together summed to get a demographicweighted average of DAUs who are subscribed then multiplied by total DAUs . I also multiplied by a “ Zombie factor ” to account for inactive users on respondents ’ friend lists . This leads me to the 100 % increase figure with assumptions Of the average user ’ s friend list 40 % are DAU 40 % are MAU and 20 % are inactive . People over age 35 making up 30 % of the user base are completely ignored . $ 2mo subscription plans are completely ignored . Assumption analysis INDIA India accounts for 40 % of users so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight . I spent 5 hours on Azar like Omegle but more popular in India but I couldn ’ t get a single Indian user to give me their data though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat . So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 110 of those in the US for the same age group . I think this is reasonable because Snapchat is 50 Rupees per month in India corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $ 2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity . DOUBLECOUNTING I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed as opposed to the friendcountweighted method I used in my first post . NOTE Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low 0.29 so this may not_be necessary . INACTIVE USERS Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis . Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap per DAU metric . Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs . As a 21year old I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity . Also criminals love Snapchat for selfdeleting texts . Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends . OTHER NOTES I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap friends . I attribute this to an error in sampling these users assumed that because they were sent to a different page than was shown their Snap friend count must be 0 . This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection . Snap doesn ’ t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards . I won ’ t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid . Schwab was showing me $ 19k in totally fake unrealized PL on Tuesday based on midtomarket rates the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x . If anyone knows how to change this please comment below . Safe to say I ’ m down a lot . But I haven ’ t sold anything . Holding till Feb 4th . Cross your fingies for me . PS See the raw data Here Id love to see your analysis PPS If you know any 35yrolds or Indians who use Snapchat please ask them for their data and comment it below ."

I'm afraid of the long end of the curve shooting up in the next several months. I could currently borrow $100k / 20yrs / 6.32%. If I wanted to lock that in and could invest it in something that yields more but is steady(ish) then I'd be set while I wait. So my question is do you think this is wise? What do you feel is the safest 6.5-7.5% yield I could get? I've looked at JEPI, VZ. I'm sure there's a bunch of options but what do you think and is it even worth it? Again, I'm afraid of the long end spiking and the rate shooting up later this year. Thanks!",

The first two are my buy and sell orders for shares, and the last image is the sell order for the leaps.

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Kevin Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve, bringing an end to months of speculation and uncertainty around the central bank’s leadership. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, saying he’s known Warsh for a long time and believes he’ll be remembered as one of the great Fed chairs. Warsh previously served as a Fed governor during the financial crisis era and has been viewed as a more market-friendly, policy-focused pick. The appointment follows a turbulent period for the Fed, marked by political pressure, public criticism from the White House, and questions about the bank’s independence. Powell’s tenure saw aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation, followed by cuts as growth slowed. Markets are now trying to figure out what this means for monetary policy going forward especially on interest rates, inflation control, and how independent the Fed will remain under new leadership. Curious to hear thoughts: does Warsh bring stability, or does this raise new concerns about political influence over the Fed? Source:",

Trump shared the news on Truth Social saying he ’ s known Warsh for a long time and believes he ’ ll be remembered as one of the great Fed chairs . Warsh previously served as a Fed governor during the financial crisis era and has been viewed as a more marketfriendly policyfocused pick . The appointment follows a turbulent period for the Fed marked by political pressure public criticism from the White House and questions about the bank ’ s independence . Powell ’ s tenure saw aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation followed by cuts as growth slowed . Markets are now trying to figure out what this means for monetary policy going forward especially on interest rates inflation control and how independent the Fed will remain under new leadership . Curious to hear thoughts does Warsh bring stability or does this raise new concerns about political influence over the Fed Source"

I ’ m trying to understand what the market may be reacting to that I missed in my due diligence . Additionally the stock appeared to rally near $ 26 in premarket trading before reversing lower once regular trading began . Was this driven by guidance forward looking commentary or broader market factors Would appreciate any insights from those who followed the call or have a deeper view . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, accelerating its plans as competition with rival Anthropic intensifies. The $500 billion startup is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a potential initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said, and is growing its finance team. That includes the hire of a new chief accounting officer, Ajmere Dale, and a new corporate business finance officer, Cynthia Gaylor, who will oversee investor relations. OpenAI, currently valued around $500 billion, has accelerated its fundraising, reportedly hoping to raise up to $100 billion, while Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbot, is said to be looking to raise about $20 billion. Separately Thursday, the Journal reported that Amazon is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI. And Japan’s SoftBank is reportedly considering investing up to $30 billion in OpenAI. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have been bleeding money, losing billions of dollars annually as they race for the upper hand in the fast-growing artificial-intelligence field. Anthropic hopes to break even in 2028, while OpenAI doesn’t foresee turning a profit until 2030. All of that could make 2026 a huge year for IPOs; Elon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly aiming to go public as soon as June, and Anthropic is also reportedly hoping for a public offering before year’s end.

Separately Thursday the Journal reported that Amazon is in talks to invest up to $ 50 billion in OpenAI . And Japan ’ s SoftBank is reportedly considering investing up to $ 30 billion in OpenAI . Both OpenAI and Anthropic have been bleeding money losing billions of dollars annually as they race for the upper hand in the fastgrowing artificialintelligence field . Anthropic hopes to break even in 2028 while OpenAI doesn ’ t foresee turning a profit until 2030 . All of that could make 2026 a huge year for IPOs Elon Musk ’ s SpaceX is reportedly aiming to go public as soon as June and Anthropic is also reportedly hoping for a public offering before year ’ s end .

The comparison underscores SK Hynix's ascension in South Korea's tech space since it was acquired by SK Telecom for about $3 billion in 2012. SK Hynix focuses almost entirely on memory chips, while Samsung operates across multiple businesses, including consumer electronics and contract chip manufacturing. Samsung's memory segment generated operating profits of about 24.9 trillion won in 2025. SK Hynix's success is in large part thanks to its entrenched position as the global leader in high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, a specialized chip used in AI processors and servers such as those produced by Nvidia.",

SK Hynix focuses almost entirely on memory chips while Samsung operates across multiple businesses including consumer electronics and contract chip manufacturing . Samsungs memory segment generated operating profits of about 24.9 trillion won in 2025 . SK Hynixs success is in large part thanks to its entrenched position as the global leader in highbandwidth memory or HBM a specialized chip used in AI processors and servers such as those produced by Nvidia ."

      "selftext": "Samsung Electronics reported an over threefold surge in fourth-quarter profits on Thursday, hitting a new record and beating analysts' estimates, as a memory chip shortage and strong demand for artificial intelligence servers lifted earnings. Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: - Revenue: 93.8 trillion Korean won ($65.58 billion) vs. 93.318 trillion won expected - Operating profit: 20.1 trillion won vs. 20.018 trillion won expected The South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose about 24% from a year earlier to hit a new record. Meanwhile, its operating profit climbed over 200% year over year. The profits surpassed Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018, while matching Samsung's own guidance of around 20 trillion won. Operating profit at the company's mobile experience division fell to 1.9 trillion won, down 9.5% from a year earlier and over 45% from the previous quarter. The company said the losses were due to \"reduced launch effects\" from new smartphone models and intense market competition.",

Management expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which equates to an annual EBITDA margin of approximately 34%.

Over the medium term, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted net revenue of at least 30% from 2025 to 2028. Additionally, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 38% to 42% from 2025 to 2028. This guidance assumes there are no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions. Management will further address guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call. Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This is because the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures.\" [",

      "selftext": "Note: * Post title says 'surge' which is not accurate. It should be 'rebounded' * Gold -8% and silver -17% was at the lowest point in pre-market. Check the charts at the bottom of this post. Source: [ >Gold and silver suffered the biggest sell-off in years, in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that’s lifted prices to all-time highs. >Gold dropped as much as 8% to crash through $5,000 an ounce, while silver slumped below $100 as the sell-off swept through the broader metals markets. Copper dropped more than 3% in London, after surging above $14,000 a ton for the first time on Thursday, in its biggest intraday jump since 2008. >The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair. The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken. Chinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets. >Silver plunged more than 17% toward $95 an ounce, intensifying a period of extreme volatility that’s rocked the precious metals industry. A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6%, making precious metals more expensive for most buyers. Platinum tumbled more than 10%. >President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair, Bloomberg News reported. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time. >Gold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.” >With gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades. >Even after the pullback, gold is still up around 17% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up nearly 40% so far this year. >The Trump administration’s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela’s leader, along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver. Most recently, Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba. >Meanwhile, the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal. The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry *Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1...* *Processing img obfjz24gfhgg1...* *Processing img myzc6u4u5kgg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Post title says surge which is not_accurate . It should be rebounded Gold 8 % and silver 17 % was at the lowest point in premarket . Check the charts at the bottom of this post . Source Gold and silver suffered the biggest selloff in years in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that ’ s lifted prices to alltime highs . Gold dropped as much as 8 % to crash through $ 5000 an ounce while silver slumped below $ 100 as the selloff swept through the broader metals markets . Copper dropped more than 3 % in London after surging above $ 14000 a ton for the first time on Thursday in its biggest intraday jump since 2008 . The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair . The greenback ’ s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken . Chinese investors have led the charge buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets . Silver plunged more than 17 % toward $ 95 an ounce intensifying a period of extreme volatility that ’ s rocked the precious metals industry . A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6 % making precious metals more expensive for most buyers . Platinum tumbled more than 10 % . President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair Bloomberg News reported . The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates . Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time . Gold ’ s move “ validates the cautionary tale of fastup fastdown ” said Christopher Wong a strategist at OverseaChinese Banking Corp . While reports of Warsh ’ s nomination were a trigger a correction was overdue he said . “ It ’ s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves. ” With gold and silver jumping so much already this year some technical indicators flashed warning signs . One is the relativestrength index which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction . Gold ’ s RSI recently hit 90 the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades . Even after the pullback gold is still up around 17 % in January closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980 . The jump in silver has been eyewatering with the white metal up nearly 40 % so far this year . The Trump administration ’ s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela ’ s leader along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver . Most recently Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba . Meanwhile the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal . The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1 ...

However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,” added Bahnsen. Since Powell’s confirmation in 2018, during Trump’s first term, he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, the president kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed’s massive renovation of its Washington, D.C. headquarters.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair ending a fivemonth odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank . The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powellled Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018 . “ I have known Kevin for a long period of time and have no_doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen maybe the best ” said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection . The pick of Warsh 55 likely wouldn ’ t ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street ’ s view that he wouldn ’ t always do Trump ’ s bidding . “ He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets ” said David Bahnsen chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group on CNBC ’ s “ Squawk Box. ” “ There was no_person who was going to get this job who wasn ’ t going to be cutting rates in the short term . However I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate ” added Bahnsen . Since Powell ’ s confirmation in 2018 during Trump ’ s first term he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively . Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025 the president kept up the attack pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed ’ s massive renovation of its Washington D.C. headquarters ."

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been noticing what feels like a real shift in how markets are being approached, and I’d love to hear some experienced perspectives. For years, the dominant strategy felt very company-centric: pick the best operators, best balance sheets, best management, especially in tech and growth sectors. Now, it seems like more capital is flowing one layer earlier into materials, minerals, and commodities themselves. Copper, aluminum, uranium, rare earths, energy inputs, etc. Instead of betting on which company will win, people are buying the stuff that everyone needs to build things: AI infrastructure, data centers, EVs, grids, defense, nuclear, renewables. It feels like a “picks and shovels” shift, but even more basic not the companies selling the shovels, but the metal the shovel is made of. Some thoughts/questions I’m wrestling with: • Is this a response to supply constraints + underinvestment over the last decade? • Is it a hedge against policy risk, geopolitics, and deglobalization? • Is it simply that materials are easier to price in an inflationary / capex-heavy world than high-multiple companies? • Or is this just another cycle that looks obvious in hindsight? For those of you who’ve been through multiple cycles: • Do commodities tend to outperform during big technological + infrastructure transitions? • Is long-term exposure (via ETFs or producers) actually a smart 5–10 year play, or do most people overstay these trades? • How do you personally think about risk management with commodities vs equities? Not looking for stock tips, more interested in how professionals frame this shift mentally and strategically. Curious to hear your takes.",

      "selftext": "Hello, i would like to start an educated discussion on Palantir stock, i’m not predicting anything (i specify it cause the bot keeps deleting the post, is it illegal to discuss stocks on a channel dedicated to stock investing?). This is my take on it: The company ~~has basically ONE~~ depends heavily on one customer, the US government, the same government that has an unmanageable 37 trillion debt that is struggling to get refinanced because everyone seems to be unloading US treasuries. The company has a gigantic CAPEX and a price/earning ratio of ~~more than 200~~ 369 so im pretty bearish on it if i look at the valuation even if i recognise the decent margins and incredible growth that seems undefensible. Can someone still bullish on Palantir explain to me why is it? please add details, i’m open to different ideas than my own. thanks! EDIT: I'm asking for an opinion, i explicitly wrote \"i’m open to different ideas than my own\", i'm not selling my take as gold and some of you had the courtesy to explain my data may not be up-to-date so please keep that in mind and remain respectful, its supposed to be an exchange of ideas not an ideological war.",

This is my take on it The company has basically ONE depends heavily on one customer the US government the same government that has an unmanageable 37 trillion debt that is struggling to get refinanced because everyone seems to be unloading US treasuries . The company has a gigantic CAPEX and a priceearning ratio of more than 200 369 so im pretty bearish on it if i look at the valuation even if i recognise the decent margins and incredible growth that seems undefensible . Can someone still bullish on Palantir explain to me why is it please add details i ’ m open to different ideas than my own . thanks EDIT Im asking for an opinion i explicitly wrote i ’ m open to different ideas than my own im not_selling my take as gold and some of you had the courtesy to explain my data may not_be uptodate so please keep that in mind and remain respectful its supposed to be an exchange of ideas not_an ideological war ."

Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

      "selftext": "Q3 2025 net income = -$21.39 million Q4 2025 net income = $38.95 million Increase = 17.56m (profitable!) So why the shift? Webull has been spending heavily on infrastructure and global expansion. They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index. It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly - with more features than many desktop apps can dream of. Ai assistant was implemented. Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement. But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story. Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly, within same year they spent the money! 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year, and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement, it seems all sunshine and rainbows. But the stock itself is telling a different story - reaching new lows day after day. Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and \"chinese ownership\" as a problem. In other words, fud is churning, retail is selling (per robinhood stat) and hedge funds are.. buying? Thats right, hedge funds are aggressively adding right now. At the same time, short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25! Furthermore, the stock is massively overleveraged. The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for - thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares. The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper. But this is very unlikely to happen. So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding, seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later, and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin. And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5% hit. So what does the future hold for webull? *concentrates* An intense warzone between fundamentals, fud, and manipulators. Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon (tesla) but.. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast? Could it be that... we see inverse tesla, and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share? The answer is.. yes. Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma, hedge funds, and fud are king. Fundamentals have not played a part in a long time. An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion. Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift.",

They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index . It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly with more features than many desktop apps can dream of . Ai assistant was implemented . Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement . But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story . Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly within same year they spent the money 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement it seems all sunshine and rainbows . But the stock itself is telling a different story reaching new lows day after day . Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and chinese ownership as a problem . In other words fud is churning retail is selling per robinhood stat and hedge funds are .. buying Thats right hedge funds are aggressively adding right now . At the same time short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25 Furthermore the stock is massively overleveraged . The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares . The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper . But this is very unlikely to happen . So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin . And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5 % hit . So what does the future hold for webull concentrates An intense warzone between fundamentals fud and manipulators . Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon tesla but .. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast Could it be that ... we see inverse tesla and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share The answer is .. yes . Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma hedge funds and fud are king . Fundamentals have not_played a part in a long time . An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion . Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift ."

      "selftext": "[Breaking News] - Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair. Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. “I’ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,” Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, “I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.” The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite. An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation. “President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor’s term.",

The process for deciding on Powell ’ s replacement began in September with an 11candidate field that included past and current Fed officials economists and Wall Street investment professionals . The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder . President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair . Speaking at the premiere for “ Melania ” the film about first lady Melania Trump the president said the fivemonth odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end . “ I ’ ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning ” Trump said . Asked if he had actually settled on a choice he replied “ I do I better otherwise I have to go to work very quickly. ” The process for deciding on Powell ’ s replacement began in September with an 11candidate field that included past and current Fed officials economists and Wall Street investment professionals . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates whittling the list down to five and then four . The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder . Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job . Hassett had been the leader for some time then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder . However that flipped Thursday evening with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80 % favorite . An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday . However a White House official dismissed speculation . “ President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture . Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone ’ s time ” said White House spokesman Kush Desai . For his part Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May . Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor ’ s term ."

      "selftext": "You should look into Etsy and their general circular internal stock compensation/buyback series. Outgoing CEO Josh Silverman was paid over $200 million in sold stock compensation, at a time when the company was overpaying for acquisitions, as seen in their recent dispositions at a 90% loss. While paying executives excessive comp packages, they have announced a non-expiring $1 billion share buyback program as the company sees fit. All the while, they have $3 billion + in debt on the balance sheet that ballooned as a result of the failed acquisitions. The company is not investing in the future, they simply are propping up their share price as the marketplace continues to be flooded with mass-manufactured products and overseas sellers. Their partnerships with AI are further very ambiguous, costing sellers more, and ultimately removing ETSY's need for existence. AI may eventually replace the marketplace altogether by selling direct and allowing customers to engage directly with sellers without the need for Etsy. While some of the above is speculation of the future, the aggressive share buyback program in a time where the company is high in debt, and low in growth, is creating a false sense of value. Etsy is trading at a 38 P/E after recent decline compared to EBAY's 20 P/E and EBAY has been much more successful in terms of scale, margins, and growth since 2021. Price Target would be in the low $30s.",

Price Target would be in the low $ 30s ."

      "selftext": "I'm not very eloquent with words, nor am I well spoken, but here it goes. Been a WSB lurker since 2018 or so, but didn't start trading options until 2025. I started with a very small percentage of my total trading account and now my options account has blown up to almost 25x of what I started with. My returns aren't quite 2500% on this account due to two reasons. 1. I traded my first option in my main portfolio and made 20% on that. I then created a new account just for options and moved 1k into it + the gains from my first options trade. 2. I accidentally selected my main account, instead of my options account when buying a couple of options. Once I liquidated those positions, I transferred the gains into my options account. No one can predict the market, so everyone asking for advice on what to invest in, no one really knows for certain. No such things as 100% free money. I will share some of the rules I've made for myself that seem to be working pretty well. Feel free to contribute or question my thought process. In no particular order. 1. Never trade with emotion. No FOMO trading. No revenge trading. No YOLO trading. If you get upset about how at trade turned out or about missing out on gains, I walk away and don't trade until I cool off. Sometimes it's a day or two, sometimes it's more than a month. 2. If you're getting upset or bothered by the ups or downs of one of your positions, you probably are in too deep on that trade and need to trade smaller amounts. 3. Building off the previous point, I don't ever put more than 20% of my capital in any single position to start. So okay, this is a very bad rule, and realistically, it should probably be closer to 5%, but this is within \\*my\\* risk tolerance. 4. This gets repeated a lot here, but it's a good one. \"No one ever went broke realizing gains\" and \"Gains > no gains\". Don't be afraid to realize gains when you're positions is up 50% up. I've let some positions ride up to 200%, but I realize most gains between 30% to 50%. 5. This is a big one. I don't play anything with an expiration shorter than 3 months. Most of my call options are between 3 to 6 months out. A couple over a year out. Yes, this also means I never touch 0DTEs. I also don't play earnings. 6. Realize the difference between luck and skill. I know I've gotten lucky a lot and I don't confuse it with being skilled. Skill means you can consistently repeat something. 7. There will ALWAYS be another opportunity, so don't force a bad trade to try to make money. 8. DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH. Google is a great tool and even just reading random posts on WSB will give you random piece of insight. Granted, 98% of WSB is shit posting, so you have a lot of crap to filter through. If you don't know what something is, research it. Bare minimum, learn the principles of options, both long and short. Learn the greeks, and what Implied Volatility and IV crush are. 9. I rarely trade against momentum, unless I have a really good reason to. Timing the bottom and top are hard. I think I've done it maybe twice in 50+ trades. 10. Don't forget the tax man and don't forget to treat yourself. Note: Almost everyone who reaches out to you for their course, newsletters, tool, scanner, or whatever is a scam. More than likely, they'll try to charge you some fee for information or tools. Yeah, all a scam.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im not_very eloquent with words nor am I well spoken but here it goes . Been a WSB lurker since 2018 or so but didnt start trading options until 2025 . I started with a very small percentage of my total trading account and now my options account has blown up to almost 25x of what I started with . My returns arent quite 2500 % on this account due to two reasons . 1 . I traded my first option in my main portfolio and made 20 % on that . I then created a new account just for options and moved 1k into it the gains from my first options trade . 2 . I accidentally selected my main account instead of my options account when buying a couple of options . Once I liquidated those positions I transferred the gains into my options account . No_one can predict the market so everyone asking for advice on what to invest in no_one really knows for certain . No_such things as 100 % free money . I will share some of the rules Ive made for myself that seem to be working pretty well . Feel free to contribute or question my thought process . In no_particular order . 1 . Never_trade with emotion . No_FOMO trading . No_revenge trading . No_YOLO trading . If you get upset about how at trade turned out or about missing out on gains I walk away and dont trade until I cool off . Sometimes its a day or two sometimes its more than a month . 2 . If youre getting upset or bothered by the ups or downs of one of your positions you probably are in too deep on that trade and need to trade smaller amounts . 3 . Building off the previous point I dont ever put more than 20 % of my capital in any single position to start . So okay this is a very bad rule and realistically it should probably be closer to 5 % but this is within my risk tolerance . 4 . This gets repeated a lot here but its a good one . No one ever went broke realizing gains and Gains no_gains . Dont be afraid to realize gains when youre positions is up 50 % up . Ive let some positions ride up to 200 % but I realize most gains between 30 % to 50 % . 5 . This is a big one . I dont play anything with an expiration shorter than 3 months . Most of my call options are between 3 to 6 months out . A couple over a year out . Yes this also means I never_touch 0DTEs . I also dont play earnings . 6 . Realize the difference between luck and skill . I know Ive gotten lucky a lot and I dont confuse it with being skilled . Skill means you can consistently repeat something . 7 . There will ALWAYS be another opportunity so dont force a bad trade to try to make money . 8 . DO YOUR FUCKING RESEARCH . Google is a great tool and even just reading random posts on WSB will give you random piece of insight . Granted 98 % of WSB is shit posting so you have a lot of crap to filter through . If you dont know what something is research it . Bare minimum learn the principles of options both long and short . Learn the greeks and what Implied Volatility and IV crush are . 9 . I rarely trade against momentum unless I have a really good reason to . Timing the bottom and top are hard . I think Ive done it maybe twice in 50 trades . 10 . Dont forget the tax man and dont forget to treat yourself . Note Almost everyone who reaches out to you for their course newsletters tool scanner or whatever is a scam . More than likely theyll try to charge you some fee for information or tools . Yeah all a scam ."

      "selftext": "Hi! You all know that when markets open they are always somewhat unstable and often rise or fall sharply; there are enormous variations in the first few minutes of the markets (I'm referring to the US markets, which are the only ones that interest me). For example, today the markets started the day falling immensely, most likely due to the shutdown. I didn't know about the shutdown because I'm not American, but if I had known, I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening. Is there a way to know, with some certainty, what will happen when the US markets open? Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open? Thank you very much.

I have 2 questions: 1. I have a Schwab account that I personally control investments on, and a Qapital robo-investing account that does it for me! I can either cash out some of my Qapital, which would simplify stock choices, or sell investments from my Schwab account, where I would have to choose which stocks/etfs/etc I'm selling. My Qapital accounts are honestly doing pretty well, but the idea of choosing stocks is daunting! Which would you recommend? 2. If I go ahead and sell stocks using my Schwab account, how do I best choose which stocks to sell? Please use the most basic terminology possible, I am absolutely NOT a finance bro and need to be talked to like (in the nicest way possible) an idiot :) Pls be gentle! Update: Spent all of last night looking through my portfolio, reading everyone's comments and learning a ton! I sold my first stocks today! Thank you so much to everyone who commented and left helpful advice, I super appreciate each and every one of you!",

I already have a growth- and tech-heavy portfolio. Roughly speaking, my current exposure looks like this: • NBIS (AI / infrastructure): \\~35% • ASTS (satellite connectivity): \\~20% • GOOG: \\~15% • RKLB (space launch): \\~10% • MU (semiconductors): \\~5% • XAR (aerospace & defense ETF): \\~5% • Small ETH exposure and other minor positions: \\~10% So I’m already very far from the index, intentionally. I am looking for stock picks, especially ideas that could reasonably outperform over a long horizon and that would complement or strengthen this portfolio rather than just add more of the same exposure. I’m interested in: • high-quality growth • infrastructure or platform businesses • situations with strong long-term Not looking to trade or gamble, and not looking for short-term hype.

      "selftext": "I have felt bearish for a long time. The market seems over priced. Gold and silver skyrocketing as safe haven. House sales slowing. Unemployment rate has been ticking up since 2023. Debt across all areas at record high(government, personal, even margin). There is a list that seem to support my bear feelings. Recently I started watching CNBC and everything seems like 2026 is going to be amazing. Earning are supporting this. Companies are building infrastructure like crazy for AI, there is not enough tech for data centers(memory, processing, data storage…). Caterpillar is up 68 percent in the last year. RCL earning show strong bookings, Apple massive growth in iPhone sales. I am sitting on 50k from a house sale last summer and don’t know what to do. It is in cash and Trump is happy to devalue the dollar, so cash is a bad idea(right)? Gold would be a good place but is it over priced now? SP500 is at record P/E ratios. Where are you putting your money and what data sources do you use as ground truth?",

Will a SpaceX merger with Tesla allow for existing $TSLA shareholders indirect access to SpaceX? What are the implications of this? \\- Would Tesla shareholders gain meaningful exposure to SpaceX’s long-term upside? \\- Would this strengthen Tesla’s ecosystem narrative or dilute its core focus? \\- Do you think this could initiate a further bull run for $TSLA?",

      "selftext": "In an extraordinary display of confidence that has sent ripples through Silicon Valley’s executive corridors, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott has committed $20 million of his personal wealth to purchase company stock while simultaneously pledging to remain at the helm through 2030. This dual announcement represents one of the most significant insider stock purchases by a sitting technology CEO in recent years and signals a dramatic vote of confidence in the enterprise software company’s long-term trajectory at a time when the sector faces mounting pressure from artificial intelligence disruption and economic uncertainty. According to Business Insider, McDermott’s substantial investment comes as ServiceNow navigates a critical inflection point in its evolution from workflow automation provider to AI-powered enterprise platform. The move is particularly noteworthy given that most executives typically receive stock compensation rather than purchasing shares with after-tax personal funds, making this transaction a powerful statement about McDermott’s conviction in the company’s strategic direction. The timing of this announcement carries special significance as ServiceNow competes against tech giants like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle in the rapidly evolving enterprise software market. McDermott’s commitment to lead the company for another six years provides stability and continuity that investors increasingly value in an era where CEO tenures have been shrinking and leadership transitions have become more frequent and disruptive across the technology sector.

Social media is being plagued with garbage, it’s integrated into every major internet browser, it’s become completely unavoidable. Yes there are plenty of day-to-day advantages but the cheap, low effort, AI fueled consumer money-grabs are everywhere. I hate it, you hate it, and anyone who cherishes real, human experiences is desperate to escape the exponentially growing wasteland that is the internet. All of this said, I’m bullish on the outdoors/camping/fishing/recreation sector as we move into the spring and summer months. I foresee a spike in these industries given the sentiment that people are going to want some sort of escape from screens/internet/etc. Some tickers that particularly interest me are the following: JOUT YETI ABNB DKS DECK CHWY ASO COLM SPWH SBDS Certainly there are plenty more tickers that could make sense for this.

      "selftext": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that’s weighing on it right now. Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups. These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears, but each has concrete near-term pops from production ramps, restructurings, or demand surges. Rivian (RIVN) trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears. It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales, way below Tesla. The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal, Illinois, with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June. Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026, pushing toward breakeven margins. Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and off-road focus that Tesla’s Cybertruck hasn’t fully nailed yet, plus locked-in supplier costs for higher-volume profitability. FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73% drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America. P/E at 4 times looks dirt cheap, 96% below peers, with earnings growth projected over 50%. Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring (shifting production to lower-cost spots) drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026. The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully, and new direct-sales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control. Fluor (FLR) around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82% reimbursable backlog to cut risk. GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026, plus SMR work. The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales, unlocking cash for buybacks. Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energy/infra projects, and long-term engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this. Ciena (CIEN) at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times, 30% discount to sector. Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs. EPS upgrades run strong (15 up, zero down recently), and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion, up about 24% at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog. The moat strengthens as the “nervous system” for AI clusters with high-capacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites, where competitors lag on speed and low-latency scale. L3Harris (LHX) around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spin-off. The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026, creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core. This unlocks value in higher-margin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyber/space. Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale (from Aerojet acquisition) that’s hard to replicate fast, plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp. I hope i am right.",

      "selftext_processed": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that ’ s weighing on it right now . Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups . These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears but each has concrete nearterm pops from production ramps restructurings or demand surges . Rivian RIVN trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears . It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales way below Tesla . The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal Illinois with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June . Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026 pushing toward breakeven margins . Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and offroad focus that Tesla ’ s Cybertruck hasn ’ t fully nailed yet plus lockedin supplier costs for highervolume profitability . FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73 % drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America . PE at 4 times looks dirt cheap 96 % below peers with earnings growth projected over 50 % . Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring shifting production to lowercost spots drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026 . The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully and new directsales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control . Fluor FLR around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82 % reimbursable backlog to cut risk . GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026 plus SMR work . The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales unlocking cash for buybacks . Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energyinfra projects and longterm engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this . Ciena CIEN at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times 30 % discount to sector . Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs . EPS upgrades run strong 15 up zero down recently and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion up about 24 % at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog . The moat strengthens as the “ nervous system ” for AI clusters with highcapacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites where competitors lag on speed and lowlatency scale . L3Harris LHX around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spinoff . The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026 creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core . This unlocks value in highermargin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyberspace . Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale from Aerojet acquisition that ’ s hard to replicate fast plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp . I hope i am right ."

BUT, this is just the beginning. What happened today is something I felt would happen - they spun off their auto OEM to focus Modine on data centers and edge computing. To say this company will be huge is an UNDERSTATEMENT. Read everything I wrote in that post - it will all happen. Here's how it'll play out: MSFT and Meta will continue spending on capex -> MOD goes up. CES 2026 companies building edge businesses -> MOD goes up. Autonomous driving/robotics continues to grow -> MOD goes up. There is a reason they split the Auto OEM off - it's low growth. MOD is now a high growth company focusing on cooling products that are generating insane amounts of heat. There are competitors, but the demand is insatiable and their backlog expands 18 months! Earnings are on the 4th of next week. Buckle up!",

The problem I keep running into is: * The ETFs don’t really line up with what I’m trying to own * They’re either too broad, too US-heavy, or feel like generic tech. * Picking individual stocks feels like committing to constant monitoring and rebalancing, which I honestly don’t want to do What I *do* want is something boring and systematic: * clear inclusion rules * predefined weights * rebalance on a schedule Basically… an index. When I looked into it, I was surprised by how simple index construction actually is (at least conceptually). I know a bit of coding, so I started wondering whether it makes more sense to just build a rule-based \"index\" for myself, instead of forcing myself into ETFs I don’t really trust. Before I go further down this rabbit hole, I’m curious: * Has anyone here tried something like this? * Will this come back and bite me in the back? Genuinely interested in hearing why this is or isn't a good idea.",

The problem I keep running into is The ETFs don ’ t really line up with what I ’ m trying to own They ’ re either too broad too USheavy or feel like generic tech . Picking individual stocks feels like committing to constant monitoring and rebalancing which I honestly don ’ t want to do What I do want is something boring and systematic clear inclusion rules predefined weights rebalance on a schedule Basically… an index . When I looked into it I was surprised by how simple index construction actually is at least conceptually . I know a bit of coding so I started wondering whether it makes more sense to just build a rulebased index for myself instead of forcing myself into ETFs I don ’ t really trust . Before I go further down this rabbit hole I ’ m curious Has anyone here tried something like this Will this come back and bite me in the back Genuinely interested in hearing why this is or isnt a good idea ."

      "selftext": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday: EPS of ($8.88 vs $8.19 expected), revenue of $59.9 billion (above expectations), and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance (projected revenue of $53.5-56.5 billion, well above the consensus around $51 billion). The most noteworthy point: capex planned for 2026 is between $115 and $135 billion, a very significant increase from $72 billion in 2025. The market reacted positively (the stock is up about +9-10% today, trading around $730-735), while Microsoft, delivering a similar message on AI investments, is down more than 10%. This divergence is interesting. On one hand, investors appear to be endorsing Meta’s strategy: strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization, exploding DAUs, and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers. On the other hand, a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks: potential overcapacity in data centers, delays in generating incremental cash flows, or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown. I’m neither compulsively selling nor buying here, but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious. Historically, when the market heavily rewards large-scale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability, it can sometimes precede later re-evaluations. Apart from that, January 2026 is shaping up to be a triple-threat market moment: * Risk of a government shutdown, * Precious metals breaking all-time historical levels, * And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window. **Why the market is reacting this way** Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that aren't dependent on government stability. That's why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs (gold recently trading around $5,070–$5,268/oz as of late January 2026, amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31). At the same time, tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure. Software is getting cheaper to scale, but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive, forcing a re-evaluation of valuations. That's why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week (easy long and short exposure, leverage to improve capital efficiency). How do you read this situation? * Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance? * Are you trimming or staying neutral, waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments? * Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names? I’m curious about your takes, especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context (interest rates, ad growth, competition). Let’s discuss calmly and factually.",

      "selftext_processed": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday EPS of $ 8.88 vs $ 8.19 expected revenue of $ 59.9 billion above expectations and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance projected revenue of $ 53.556.5 billion well above the consensus around $ 51 billion . The most noteworthy point capex planned for 2026 is between $ 115 and $ 135 billion a very significant increase from $ 72 billion in 2025 . The market reacted positively the stock is up about 910 % today trading around $ 730735 while Microsoft delivering a similar message on AI investments is down more than 10 % . This divergence is interesting . On one hand investors appear to be endorsing Meta ’ s strategy strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization exploding DAUs and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers . On the other hand a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks potential overcapacity in data centers delays in generating incremental cash flows or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown . I ’ m neither_compulsively selling nor buying here but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious . Historically when the market heavily rewards largescale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability it can sometimes precede later reevaluations . Apart from that January 2026 is shaping up to be a triplethreat market moment Risk of a government shutdown Precious metals breaking alltime historical levels And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window . Why the market is reacting this way Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that arent dependent on government stability . Thats why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs gold recently trading around $ 5070– $ 5268oz as of late January 2026 amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31 . At the same time tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure . Software is getting cheaper to scale but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive forcing a reevaluation of valuations . Thats why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week easy long and short exposure leverage to improve capital efficiency . How do you read this situation Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance Are you trimming or staying neutral waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names I ’ m curious about your takes especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context interest rates ad growth competition . Let ’ s discuss calmly and factually ."

      "selftext": "META’s recovery over the past few years is a good reminder that crowd sentiment is often a lagging indicator. During the previous drawdown, the dominant narrative was that META’s core business was permanently impaired. Valuation compression, heavy capex concerns, and layoffs made it an easy stock to dismiss. That period, however, is where the risk-reward profile quietly flipped. From the lows, the stock went on to deliver a 7x move. What stood out to me wasn’t prediction accuracy, but structure: Revenues stabilized before sentiment improved Cost discipline showed up in margins before headlines changed Liquidity returned long before retail interest did Tracking equities alongside broader market instruments helped frame META less as a “story stock” and more as a mean-reversion + execution case. That’s also why I’ve been following environments like stock futures trading not for promotion, but because derivatives often reflect positioning and sentiment shifts earlier than spot discussions do. Disclosure: I previously held a long position in META during part of this recovery and currently hold no open META position. Main takeaway Crowd narratives tend to peak after the asymmetric opportunity has passed. Structure, liquidity, and fundamentals usually turn first.",

Main takeaway Crowd narratives tend to peak after the asymmetric opportunity has passed . Structure liquidity and fundamentals usually turn first ."

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested.?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over extended periods idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing drawdown deployment or reduced forced selling during market stress . While this approach may lower expected returns it could potentially improve riskadjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented . From a structural perspective this raises a broader question should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management or simply an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize For those focused on long horizons how do you think about this tradeoff in practice Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested ."

We're executing and winning with programs like the Apple Card and robust growth in value-added services and solutions at 23%, or 21% currency-neutral. The overall macroeconomic environment is supportive and we continue to see healthy consumer and business spending. That, together with trusted technology, constant innovation, and deep partnerships, powers our performance. Focused, agile, and diversified, we’re well positioned for the opportunities ahead in 2026.” Mastercard’s Value-Added Services continues to be a compounding machine for the company. It’s interesting to see the company diversify itself away from just being a payment network provider.",

      "selftext": "ALRIGHT LISTEN TO ME because my wife’s boyfriend only gave me 5 minutes on the computer before he needs to check his fantasy football league. You guys are looking at the charts but you aren't seeing the **PHYSICS**. Look at the market right now. **Semiconductors** (NVDA, AMD, TSM)? TO THE MOON. They are the BRAINS. The logic gates. The thinking rocks we tricked into doing math. Look at **Metals/Conductors** (Copper, Gold, Silver)? RIPPING. We are digging shiny rocks out of the ground like dwarves on meth. This is the BLOOD. The flow. The path of least resistance. But you smooth-brained degenerates are missing the third leg of the Holy Trinity of Electricity. The market is currently an **OPEN CIRCUIT**. The money is leaking out into the atmosphere because *there is no insulation.* **THE THESIS: THE GREAT INSULATOR SUPER-CYCLE (GISC)** Electricity 101: If you have a conductor (Copper) and a Semiconductor (Nvidia), and you pump infinite voltage (J-Pow's money printer) into it without insulation, WHAT HAPPENS? **SHORT CIRCUIT.** THE SYSTEM FRIES. We need **RESISTANCE.** We need to stop the current from grounding out so we can trap the energy (tendies) inside the portfolio forever. **THE PLAY: ISOLATOR STOCKS** I am talking about the boring, dusty companies that make the pink stuff in your walls and the ceramic disks on power lines. 1. **Owens Corning (OC):** They make fiberglass. PINK FIBERGLASS. It’s basically cotton candy that makes you itch and stops money from leaving your house. 2. **Hubbell (HUBB):** They make electrical insulators. If the grid doesn't have these, the AI revolution burns down the forest. No insulators = No AI. NVDA goes to zero without HUBB. MATH. 3. **Rockwool (ROCK-B):** IT IS LITERAL WOOL MADE OF ROCKS. How is this not trading at 5,000x PE? It is fireproof. It is idiot-proof. It is the skin of the beast. **THE SINGULARITY** Once we pump the Isolators, we complete the **Global Circuit**. * **Semiconductors** generate the signal. * **Conductors** carry the signal. * **Isolators** contain the signal. When the trifecta is complete, the velocity of money hits zero because it cannot escape the loop. We achieve **Superconducting Financial Singularity.** The stock market becomes a perpetual motion machine. We will literally transcend fiat currency and start trading in pure joules of energy. **TL;DR:** NVDA is the brain. Copper is the veins. **INSULATION IS THE SKIN.** Right now the market is a flayed man running down the street screaming. BUY THE SKIN. BUY THE PINK STUFF. POSITIONS: $OC 200C 1/30 (Expiring tomorrow, don't ask) $HUBB Calls (All of them) 20 tons of stolen copper wire in my garage (Hedge)",

You guys are looking at the charts but you arent seeing the PHYSICS . Look at the market right now . Semiconductors NVDA AMD TSM TO THE MOON . They are the BRAINS . The logic gates . The thinking rocks we tricked into doing math . Look at MetalsConductors Copper Gold Silver RIPPING . We are digging shiny rocks out of the ground like dwarves on meth . This is the BLOOD . The flow . The path of least resistance . But you smoothbrained degenerates are missing the third leg of the Holy Trinity of Electricity . The market is currently an OPEN CIRCUIT . The money is leaking out into the atmosphere because there is no_insulation . THE THESIS THE GREAT INSULATOR SUPERCYCLE GISC Electricity 101 If you have a conductor Copper and a Semiconductor Nvidia and you pump infinite voltage JPows money printer into it without insulation WHAT HAPPENS SHORT CIRCUIT . THE SYSTEM FRIES . We need RESISTANCE . We need to stop the current from grounding out so we can trap the energy tendies inside the portfolio forever . THE PLAY ISOLATOR STOCKS I am talking about the boring dusty companies that make the pink stuff in your walls and the ceramic disks on power lines . 1 . Owens Corning OC They make fiberglass . PINK FIBERGLASS . It ’ s basically cotton candy that makes you itch and stops money from leaving your house . 2 . Hubbell HUBB They make electrical insulators . If the grid doesnt have these the AI revolution burns down the forest . No_insulators No_AI . NVDA goes to zero without HUBB . MATH . 3 . Rockwool ROCKB IT IS LITERAL WOOL MADE OF ROCKS . How is this not_trading at 5000x PE It is fireproof . It is idiotproof . It is the skin of the beast . THE SINGULARITY Once we pump the Isolators we complete the Global Circuit . Semiconductors generate the signal . Conductors carry the signal . Isolators contain the signal . When the trifecta is complete the velocity of money hits zero because it can not escape the loop . We achieve Superconducting Financial Singularity . The stock market becomes a perpetual motion machine . We will literally transcend fiat currency and start trading in pure joules of energy . TLDR NVDA is the brain . Copper is the veins . INSULATION IS THE SKIN . Right now the market is a flayed man running down the street screaming . BUY THE SKIN . BUY THE PINK STUFF .

The closest one I found was Fossil Group $FOSL. Fossil did a UK restructuring in November 2025. After that the stock went from around $1.9 to about $4. There was no squeeze setup there. Short interest was only around 13 percent. Borrow fee was roughly 10 to 15 percent. Float was not tight. $NFE is very different. Short interest is around 30 to 40 percent depending on the source. Borrow fee is already close to 100 percent. Looking at the options chain most of the short position does not look hedged. There is not much call coverage. If price moves up they have to buy stock. Also the float is locked 90% by insiders and institutions. Most people who shorted $NFE did it with one assumption. Chapter 11. Equity wipeout. UK restructuring is not that. It is a different legal path. Different incentives. Different timeline. Equity does not automatically go to zero. Preferred equity will be issued but that does not immediately dilute the stock, meaning shorts are caught in a squeeze Because of that the original short thesis breaks. Shorts are now stuck holding a position that is expensive to maintain and hard to exit if volume comes in. Fossil doubled with weak short interest and low borrow. $NFE has much higher short interest and much higher borrow.",

So, I have all of my silver exposure in this one stock PSLV. I would like to diversify a bit. Are there any other safe equity alternatives that would give the exposure to the silver price?

      "selftext": "The common narrative on this sub is: *\"Nvidia is too expensive, so I’ll buy AMD as the value play.\"* It makes intuitive sense. NVDA is at all-time highs, and everyone loves an underdog. But \"intuition\" loses money. I ran the numbers through my valuation models (blending VC-style projections, DCF, and Analyst Consensus), and the math actually proves the opposite. **The Reality: NVDA is the one trading at \"Fair Value.\" AMD is the one trading at a massive premium.** Here is the breakdown of the Title Fight. **Contender 1: The Challenger (AMD)** * **Current Price:** \\~$252 * **Intrinsic Value:** \\~$232 - $245 * **The Verdict:** **Overvalued (Wait)** **The Problem:** AMD is being priced for a future that hasn't happened yet. The 5-Star Analysts (Piper, UBS) have targets of $300+ because they are betting on a massive \"Nvidia Moment\" with the MI300 chips. But when you run the actual math (DCF/PEG) based on *current* cash flow, the fair value is closer to **$232**. **The Silent Killer:** **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital).** Nobody talks about this, but look at the spread: * **AMD ROIC:** \\~4.1% * **Cost of Capital (WACC):** \\~9.5% Right now, AMD is technically destroying value to build its infrastructure. They are spending billions to catch up, but the cash flow isn't there yet. **The Risk:** Earnings are on **Feb 3 (Monday)**. This is a binary event. If they guide weak, or if that ROIC doesn't tick up, the drop to the $225 support level will be fast. **Contender 2: The King (NVDA)** * **Current Price:** \\~$191.50 * **Intrinsic Value:** \\~$189 * **The Verdict:** **Fair Value (Hold/Accumulate)** **The Paradox:** It sounds crazy to call a $3 Trillion company \"cheap,\" but Nvidia defies the laws of capitalism. * **PEG Ratio:** 0.77 (Anything under 1.0 is considered \"Cheap\" for growth). * **ROIC:** **90.9%**. (Read that again. For every $1 they invest, they get $1.90 back). My blended model puts NVDA’s value around **$189**. At $191, you are paying exactly what the business is worth. You aren't getting a discount, but you aren't paying a \"hype premium\" either. You are buying a monopoly at fair market value. **The Final Verdict** I know everyone wants to find the \"Next Nvidia,\" but the math suggests the best play is still just... Nvidia. 1. **NVDA:** **Hold.** If it dips to **$165 - $170**, buy aggressively. You are buying a 90% ROIC machine at a discount. 2. **AMD:** **Wait.** The \"Buy Zone\" is **$220 - $225**. Do not chase it at $252 right before earnings. Let the Feb 3 report confirm the execution before you risk your capital. *Disclaimer: Not financial advice. Just a guy with a spreadsheet.*",

NVDA is at alltime highs and everyone loves an underdog . But intuition loses money . I ran the numbers through my valuation models blending VCstyle projections DCF and Analyst Consensus and the math actually proves the opposite . The Reality NVDA is the one trading at Fair Value . AMD is the one trading at a massive premium . Here is the breakdown of the Title Fight . Contender 1 The Challenger AMD Current Price $ 252 Intrinsic Value $ 232 $ 245 The Verdict Overvalued Wait The Problem AMD is being priced for a future that hasnt happened yet . The 5Star Analysts Piper UBS have targets of $ 300 because they are betting on a massive Nvidia Moment with the MI300 chips . But when you run the actual math DCFPEG based on current cash flow the fair value is closer to $ 232 . The Silent Killer ROIC Return on Invested Capital . Nobody_talks about this but look at the spread AMD ROIC 4.1 % Cost of Capital WACC 9.5 % Right now AMD is technically destroying value to build its infrastructure . They are spending billions to catch up but the cash flow isnt there yet . The Risk Earnings are on Feb 3 Monday . This is a binary event . If they guide weak or if that ROIC doesnt tick up the drop to the $ 225 support level will be fast . Contender 2 The King NVDA Current Price $ 191.50 Intrinsic Value $ 189 The Verdict Fair Value HoldAccumulate The Paradox It sounds crazy to call a $ 3 Trillion company cheap but Nvidia defies the laws of capitalism . PEG Ratio 0.77 Anything under 1.0 is considered Cheap for growth . ROIC 90.9 % . Read that again . For every $ 1 they invest they get $ 1.90 back . My blended model puts NVDA ’ s value around $ 189 . At $ 191 you are paying exactly what the business is worth . You arent getting a discount but you arent paying a hype premium either . You are buying a monopoly at fair market value . The Final Verdict I know everyone wants to find the Next Nvidia but the math suggests the best play is still just ... Nvidia . 1 . NVDA Hold . If it dips to $ 165 $ 170 buy aggressively . You are buying a 90 % ROIC machine at a discount . 2 . AMD Wait . The Buy Zone is $ 220 $ 225 . Do not_chase it at $ 252 right before earnings . Let the Feb 3 report confirm the execution before you risk your capital . Disclaimer Not_financial advice . Just a guy with a spreadsheet ."

      "selftext": "Hi, the title is self-explanatory. I know that investing in individual stocks is generally less efficient than investing in ETFs, and in fact my entire portfolio is currently made up of ETFs. That said, I was wondering about allocating a small percentage of my portfolio to riskier investments, such as picking a few individual stocks. Do you also like to “gamble” with a small portion of your portfolio, or do you strictly stick to a passive investment strategy and keep things simple?",

I know that investing in individual stocks is generally less efficient than investing in ETFs and in fact my entire portfolio is currently made up of ETFs . That said I was wondering about allocating a small percentage of my portfolio to riskier investments such as picking a few individual stocks . Do you also like to “ gamble ” with a small portion of your portfolio or do you strictly stick to a passive investment strategy and keep things simple"

      "selftext": "LONG READ WARNING! :) Hello everyone, as a property investment consultant & broker in the UAE, lately, a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market. I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE, but isn't sure where to start, which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet. I'll give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market & explain the best areas to invest in. To give you a little background information, Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago (Dubai has been offering this since 2002, for comparison). In the first half of 2025, there were only 4000 new off-plan units launched in Abu Dhabi, whereas in the same time frame, there were about 65,000 launched in Dubai. Abu Dhabi's population is currently growing much faster than Dubai's (twice as much in the last year), and continues to grow rapidly, so the rental demand & yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage. Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours & experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabi's real estate market. In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD (+39% YoY). \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at: • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer off-plan developments but with very high potential: • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO: \\- ALDAR (They lead the market & have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi. Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out & Aldar properties hold their value very well) \\- SOBHA \\- MODON \\- SAAS Properties \\- Bloom Holding \\- OBJECT 1 \\- ICT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI: For reference, when you buy off-plan property directly from a developer in the UAE, whether you're a resident or a foreign investor, you have the option to go with a \"payment plan\" which will usually look something like this \"60/40 10% down\" or \"65/35 5% down\" and there are a lot of different options. The breakdown goes as follows: For 60/40 - 10% down: 10% of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2% govt fees 50% is paid in 4-6 installments over the course of (usually) 3 years while the property is under development 40% is paid once the project is completed & your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the \"Early stage flip\" & \"Pre-handover exit\" Early stage flip: Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment, 5% or 10% in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply (because not all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want) and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch. Basically before the next installment is due (usually around 6 months from purchase), investors resell the contract at a premium, typically in the range of $50,000-$150,000, depending on the project. Pre-handover edit: investors continue paying installments over the construction period. By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due, market value has often appreciated significantly, especially when the asset is from a top developer & in a strong location. So for example, a unit purchased at $460K may be valued at around $730K-$820K before handover, allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term. Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term, capital appreciation can be a lot higher, especially in prime locations. The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Now let's expand on the areas i mentioned earlier, 1. YAS ISLAND: \\- Entertainment + Tourism Hub (Beaches, Golf, Theme parks, Nightlife, Sports, Concerts, MMA, F1, etc.) \\- Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi. (This is important because it will further boost tourism & demand in the area and drive property value up.) Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6.5-8.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 12-18% YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx. 8-11% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $400K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$800K • Villas & Townhouses - $1.3M-$4m+ 2. SAADIYAT ISLAND (my personal favorite): \\- Lifestyle, Cultural District & Luxury: \\- Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest long-term real estate investments in the UAE. The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers, supported by limited supply & prestige branding. Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI. Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years. The Island is Abu Dhabi's art & cultural district & has museums such as the Louvre, the Guggenheim, The national history museum & Sheikh Zayed museum. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 5.5-7.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 15-28% YoY (one of the highest in the UAE) • Apartment Value Growth approx. 10-15% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $700K-$1.4M+ • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $1.5M+ • Villas & Townhouses - $3M+ 3. AL REEM ISLAND: \\- More affordable than Saadiyat & Yas island but still very popular. A great community that's popular with younger professionals and expats. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6-9% • Apartment Value Growth approx. 7-12% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $150K-$250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $250K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $750K-$1.2M • 4+ Bedroom Villas - $1.7M-$2.5M+ 4. HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND \\- A sports & lifestyle hub. Mostly beachfront living, with a focus on sports & wellness. Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now. All the projects launched there are selling out instantly. For example, the most recent one was \"Bashayer\" by MODON. It sold out in 1 day, generating 3 Billion AED in sales. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3+ Bedroom Villas - $1.2M-$2.5M 5. FAHID ISLAND \\- Fahid Island is developed by Aldar & is a wellness-focused island positioned between Yas Island & Saadiyat Island & one of the most anticipated master-planned developments in Abu Dhabi. Its designed around low-density living, walkability, greenery, beaches and curated community facilities & Its attracting strong investor & end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation & the islands strategic location. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $1.2M-$2M 5. RAMHAN ISLAND \\- Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills, focusing on private waterfront villas, private beaches & resort-style living. It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabi's most exclusive residential projects. The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors & end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value, privacy and long term capital appreciation potential. Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle that's still close to the city. Typical Prices: • 3-7 Bedroom Villas - $2.5M - $10M Personally, I really believe in Saadiyat Island, Yas Island & Hudairiyat as long-term investments. I purchased off-plan property in Saadiyat myself last year & hope to invest in another project there soon as well. Given the market history, the governments investments & support in developing the areas, and the very limited space left to build, i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce. The scarcity combined with their prime locations, makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now. To give you an idea, The off-plan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $1M (I've only paid the 5% down payment + 2% + first installment so far, in total about $120k), I could already sell for a $70k-$85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat. If you'd like to do a bit of research yourself, look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island, for example, from last year like \"Mamsha Gardens\" & \"The Row\", then look at the current resale prices they're listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT. This will give you an idea of how fast off-plan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat. Since i'm mostly explaining off-plan investments here and also since theres of course, a lot more information about off-plan, the secondary market & UAE real estate in general, for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further, feel free to ask & I'm happy to answer!",

      "selftext_processed": "LONG READ WARNING Hello everyone as a property investment consultant broker in the UAE lately a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market . I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE but isnt sure where to start which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet . Ill give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market explain the best areas to invest in . To give you a little background information Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital Abu Dhabi . The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago Dubai has been offering this since 2002 for comparison . In the first half of 2025 there were only 4000 new offplan units launched in Abu Dhabi whereas in the same time frame there were about 65000 launched in Dubai . Abu Dhabis population is currently growing much faster than Dubais twice as much in the last year and continues to grow rapidly so the rental demand yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage . Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabis real estate market . In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD 39 % YoY . _____ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer offplan developments but with very high potential • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island _____ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO ALDAR They lead the market have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi . Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out Aldar properties hold their value very well SOBHA MODON SAAS Properties Bloom Holding OBJECT 1 ICT _____ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI For reference when you buy offplan property directly from a developer in the UAE whether youre a resident or a foreign investor you have the option to go with a payment plan which will usually look something like this 6040 10 % down or 6535 5 % down and there are a lot of different options . The breakdown goes as follows For 6040 10 % down 10 % of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2 % govt fees 50 % is paid in 46 installments over the course of usually 3 years while the property is under development 40 % is paid once the project is completed your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the Early stage flip Prehandover exit Early stage flip Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment 5 % or 10 % in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply because not_all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch . Basically before the next installment is due usually around 6 months from purchase investors resell the contract at a premium typically in the range of $ 50000 $ 150000 depending on the project . Prehandover edit investors continue paying installments over the construction period . By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due market value has often appreciated significantly especially when the asset is from a top developer in a strong location . So for example a unit purchased at $ 460K may be valued at around $ 730K $ 820K before handover allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term . Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term capital appreciation can be a lot higher especially in prime locations . The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling . _____ Now lets expand on the areas i mentioned earlier 1 .

RAMHAN ISLAND Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills focusing on private waterfront villas private beaches resortstyle living . It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabis most exclusive residential projects . The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value privacy and long term capital appreciation potential . Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle thats still close to the city . Typical Prices • 37 Bedroom Villas $ 2.5M $ 10M Personally I really believe in Saadiyat Island Yas Island Hudairiyat as longterm investments . I purchased offplan property in Saadiyat myself last year hope to invest in another project there soon as well . Given the market history the governments investments support in developing the areas and the very limited space left to build i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce . The scarcity combined with their prime locations makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now . To give you an idea The offplan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $ 1M Ive only paid the 5 % down payment 2 % first installment so far in total about $ 120k I could already sell for a $ 70k $ 85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat . If youd like to do a bit of research yourself look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island for example from last year like Mamsha Gardens The Row then look at the current resale prices theyre listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT . This will give you an idea of how fast offplan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat . Since im mostly explaining offplan investments here and also since theres of course a lot more information about offplan the secondary market UAE real estate in general for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further feel free to ask Im happy to answer"

      "selftext": "In mid-2025, Western media was flooded with headlines like: ‘China will fall ten years behind without Nvidia chips,’ ‘H200 is the AI key Beijing cannot replicate,’ and ‘U.S. chip bans will strangle China’s AI ambitions.’ Wall Street analysts predicted Nvidia would continue to dominate the global AI market with over 95% market share, and that China had ‘no choice’ but to accept Washington’s terms. Reality turned out very differently. On January 13, 2026, the Trump administration, after months of hardline sanctions, reversed course and allowed Nvidia to export H200 chips to China under a series of conditions: third-party inspections, a cap limiting China to at most 50% of the volume sold to the U.S., a ban on military use, and an additional 25% surcharge collected by the U.S. government. But just one day later (January 14), Chinese customs announced a suspension of H200 imports, leaving thousands of Nvidia’s expensive chips stuck at ports. This ‘drama’ was not random. It is a lesson Washington is now being forced to learn the hard way: the more sanctions intensify, the more determined China becomes to achieve self-reliance. And they are making progress Liu Ying, a researcher at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies, made a remark that has forced Western analysts to rethink: ‘Looking back, the tariffs imposed by the United States on countries like China have actually promoted the diversification of our international trade and international cooperation, and have become a driving force behind China’s technological independence.’ China’s trade with ASEAN has surged, surpassing the U.S. to become its largest trading partner. Trade with the EU and with Belt and Road countries has seen double-digit growth. Trade with the U.S. has fallen by nearly 20%, yet China’s GDP still grew 5.2% in 2025. In semiconductors, this ‘catalyst effect’ is even more obvious. In 2024, Nvidia held 66% of China’s AI chip market. By early 2026, according to Bernstein forecasts, that share is expected to collapse to just 8%, while domestic Chinese firms (Huawei, Cambricon, Moore Threads, Iluvatar CoreX, etc.) are projected to take roughly 80% of the market. Zhang Jianzhong, CEO of Moore Threads, said confidently at the Huashan product launch: ‘Our new products meet the needs of domestic developers. There will be no need to wait for advanced foreign products anymore.’ Which is why sanctions against China were never a smart move. In reality, sanctions only accelerate China’s development.",

Trade with the EU and with Belt and Road countries has seen doubledigit growth . Trade with the U.S. has fallen by nearly 20 % yet China ’ s GDP still grew 5.2 % in 2025 . In semiconductors this ‘ catalyst effect ’ is even more obvious . In 2024 Nvidia held 66 % of China ’ s AI chip market . By early 2026 according to Bernstein forecasts that share is expected to collapse to just 8 % while domestic Chinese firms Huawei Cambricon Moore Threads Iluvatar CoreX etc . are projected to take roughly 80 % of the market . Zhang Jianzhong CEO of Moore Threads said confidently at the Huashan product launch ‘ Our new products meet the needs of domestic developers . There will be no_need to wait for advanced foreign products anymore. ’ Which is why sanctions against China were never_a smart move . In reality sanctions only accelerate China ’ s development ."

      "title": "Weak dollar and Trump's sabre rattling sees Gold soar past Goldman Sachs' 2026 price target of $5500 in just one month",
      "selftext": "From [The Guardian](#selection-1451.0-1523.194): The surge in the gold price is showing no sign of abating, as bullion continues to soar. Gold has jumped over the $5,500 an ounce level this morning, just three days after hitting $5,000 for the first time, taking its gains so far this year to almost 30% (!). It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets, looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar, which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency’s year‑to‑date softness. That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement, boosting gold’s attractiveness. As Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, explains: “That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher, as the price keeps climbing, and given renewed impetus by Trump’s comments on the dollar. This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats, as it reinforces their thesis. “Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum, something comes along to rescue it. So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar, the future for gold looks bright indeed.” Concerns around the independence of America’s central bank are also lifting gold. Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night, it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year. That could weaken the dollar further, and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price. The rise in precious metals prices is “breathtaking and profoundly scary”, warns Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings Institute. He writes: “The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum. “At the same time, we’re seeing government bond markets in high-debt countries like Japan under severe pressure, even as there’s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger. We’re at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt. Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “safe haven” bid as part of this phenomenon.”",

      "selftext_processed": "From The Guardianselection1451.01523.194 The surge in the gold price is showing no_sign of abating as bullion continues to soar . Gold has jumped over the $ 5500 an ounce level this morning just three days after hitting $ 5000 for the first time taking its gains so far this year to almost 30 % . It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty . Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency ’ s year‑to‑date softness . That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement boosting gold ’ s attractiveness . As Chris Beauchamp Chief Market Analyst at IG explains “ That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher as the price keeps climbing and given renewed impetus by Trump ’ s comments on the dollar . This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats as it reinforces their thesis . “ Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum something comes along to rescue it . So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar the future for gold looks bright indeed. ” Concerns around the independence of America ’ s central bank are also lifting gold . Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year . That could weaken the dollar further and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price . The rise in precious metals prices is “ breathtaking and profoundly scary ” warns Robin Brooks senior fellow at Brookings Institute . He writes “ The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum . “ At the same time we ’ re seeing government bond markets in highdebt countries like Japan under severe pressure even as there ’ s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden Norway and Switzerland . Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger . We ’ re at the start of a global debt crisis with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away outofcontrol debt . Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “ safe haven ” bid as part of this phenomenon . ”"

That’s red flag for me. It’s the universal sign that even the biggest whales are genuinely terrified. Usually, I've trusted that central banks will pull some new rabbit out of a hat, but right now they seem trapped between two impossible choices: let the currency collapse or let the entire debt system explode. I’ve never felt this level of uncertainty before and honestly, it’s pretty haunting. How you guys are doing and what u think about this? Hop on gold/silver train at ATH? go for BTC?",

It ’ s the universal sign that even the biggest whales are genuinely terrified . Usually Ive trusted that central banks will pull some new rabbit out of a hat but right now they seem trapped between two impossible choices let the currency collapse or let the entire debt system explode . I ’ ve never_felt this level of uncertainty before and honestly it ’ s pretty haunting . How you guys are doing and what u think about this Hop on goldsilver train at ATH go for BTC"

      "selftext": "Hello, I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing. I am tackling it 3 ways. 1. Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $100 when creating a new account and depositing $100. Not sure if I chose it or not, but they put the $100+$100 in some mixed tech stock. Google, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. From then until now the $200 grew to $268.12. 2. To dabble in Crypto mining, I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash. Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit, but it seems to be hanging in there. They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC, ie, about $21. I am probably losing money due to electricity cost, but they are heating my house :) I intend to move them to my off-grid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment, basically free electricity. It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost, but that is already money down the drain. 3. I took advantage of a Rakuten $150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $200 within a month. I just bought $210 worth of BTC which had a $3.10 fee. Will have to wait for the $150 CB. On the surface, my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something. I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys, but it is a start. I suspect my 36a of off-grid property in AZ was my best purchase. Are you guys on team crypto, or team stocks, or perhaps team real estate? I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made, and I couldn't pass up the CB on the Kraken account, but not sure where I should move the money? Thoughts? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing . I am tackling it 3 ways . 1 . Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $ 100 when creating a new account and depositing $ 100 . Not_sure if I chose it or not_but they put the $ 100 $ 100 in some mixed tech stock . Google Apple Nvidia Amazon and Microsoft . From then until now the $ 200 grew to $ 268.12 . 2 . To dabble in Crypto mining I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash . Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit but it seems to be hanging in there . They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC ie about $ 21 . I am probably losing money due to electricity cost but they are heating my house I intend to move them to my offgrid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment basically free electricity . It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost but that is already money down the drain . 3 . I took advantage of a Rakuten $ 150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $ 200 within a month . I just bought $ 210 worth of BTC which had a $ 3.10 fee . Will have to wait for the $ 150 CB . On the surface my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something . I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys but it is a start . I suspect my 36a of offgrid property in AZ was my best purchase . Are you guys on team crypto or team stocks or perhaps team real estate I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made and I couldnt pass up the CB on the Kraken account but not_sure where I should move the money Thoughts Thanks"

I'm a late starter obviously, but I'm committed to contributing $200 biweekly for now until my salary increases, or household costs come down. I was playing around for a while with another TFSA on the side with Wealthsimple, just $50 biweekly, buying and researching ETFS, bonds, and individual stocks, and just learning more in general. It was supposed to be my fun savings account, but I just can't afford that extra $50 biweekly unfortunately, so I've just committed to my one with RBC for now until it grows to a bigger number, and also so I don't have to think about it for now and just focus on saving more liquidity. I'm wondering if I should increase my RBC TFSA to medium-high risk for now, seeing as I still have a long time in the investment horizon, and then lower it back to low-medium risk when I'm older in my 40-50s, and even just transfer it all to my own portfolio on Wealthsimple one day to save even further on MER.",

Im a late starter obviously but Im committed to contributing $ 200 biweekly for now until my salary increases or household costs come down . I was playing around for a while with another TFSA on the side with Wealthsimple just $ 50 biweekly buying and researching ETFS bonds and individual stocks and just learning more in general . It was supposed to be my fun savings account but I just cant afford that extra $ 50 biweekly unfortunately so Ive just committed to my one with RBC for now until it grows to a bigger number and also so I dont have to think about it for now and just focus on saving more liquidity . Im wondering if I should increase my RBC TFSA to mediumhigh risk for now seeing as I still have a long time in the investment horizon and then lower it back to lowmedium risk when Im older in my 4050s and even just transfer it all to my own portfolio on Wealthsimple one day to save even further on MER ."

DBS has you covered! here's the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with \"equity research filetype:pdf\" on google. scroll a bit down, and you'll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock. [for example, just searching up \"CVX equity reseach filetype:pdf\" got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron]( 2. once you're there, press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at. using the chevron example, you change it from [ to [ by just by changing that last part at the end (make sure to capitalize it!) i have no idea what type of [security pre-cautions]( DBS has employed, but nearly every mega-cap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see. for example... **mag 7 coverage from DBS** Tesla - [ Meta - [ Apple - [ Google - [ Nvidia - [ Amazon - [ Microsoft - [ yep... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available. you know... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too. i honestly have no idea when they're going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not to bring up. if you've ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings... here's your shot. **edit: i've managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not only publish their analyst reports, but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a \"report\" analysts shit out when they need to justify upgrading or downgrading. all you need to do is search \"industry dbs filetype:pdf\"** technology outlook: [ 2026 outlook: [ weekly macro insights from their chief economist (link auto-downloads the pdf): [google

      "selftext_processed": "hola fella regards . ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it without having spend the nearly $ 100k that most sellside shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports DBS has you covered heres the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with equity research filetypepdf on google . scroll a bit down and youll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock . for example just searching up CVX equity reseach filetypepdf got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron 2. once youre there press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at . using the chevron example you change it from to by just by changing that last part at the end make sure to capitalize it i have no_idea what type of security precautions DBS has employed but nearly every megacap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see . for example ... mag 7 coverage from DBS Tesla Meta Apple Google Nvidia Amazon Microsoft yep ... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available . you know ... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too . i honestly have no_idea when theyre going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not_to bring up . if youve ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings ... heres your shot . edit ive managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not_only publish their analyst reports but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a

      "title": "OII - Subsea Robotics, Artic Supremacy, and the S Korean Retail Connection",
      "selftext": "OII has historically been an oil services company, but internally it has been making a much under-appreciated shift to an autonomy, robotics, and defense company. For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers. ased on recent news, my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is: (a) US Navy build-out given that China ship-building capacity vastly out-strips the the US at this point, and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world (note, this was the reason Venezuela mattered...Panama isthmus... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters. (b) Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle, where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad. So bottom line is - US is completely dominant in Space, Missiles, and Air - but sea is more dicey than anything else. I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive. So back to OII...compare is to OIH (oil services companies) and it trades basically in tandem with that. It also has an oil services multiple of \\~1x ev / sales and 5x ev / ebidtda. However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment. Here is some of what they are capable of. [ Now to the interesting part: The March DoD Contract. In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company’s history. The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense. Note, this is a serious company, they make about 3b in rev a year. They don't play any games. In other words, there is no reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders. In Q1 2025, they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract. Bottom line, the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor (a \"part-maker\") to the lead company managing an entire military program - in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend. What's this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play? What are the comps here? Well, right now the only decent comp is Kraken. Which is now a 2b ev off of \\~20m in quarterly rev. Again OII is only 3b ev against \\~750m in quarterly revenue. Kraken is looking a 27x / sales vs 1x sales for OII. I am not here to talk shit about Kraken. I think the company is great and could continue to rip. My point is simply this - the market is very, very thirsty for subsea military tech. So thirsty, they seem to form cults around them. This brings me to my other major points - the S Korean retail interest. From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts.. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on. He rarely pitches new names, and when he does people sit up and listen. In this case, the OII post got about \\~200k views and very enthusiastic responses. After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum, my general heuristic is - when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible. In sum, if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda, this would would be 3x on the commons...which given the modest IV would translate to \\~20x on a many of the strikes. And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations - which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to, this could be bar none the trade of the year. Disclosure: I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40.",

      "selftext_processed": "OII has historically been an oil services company but internally it has been making a much underappreciated shift to an autonomy robotics and defense company . For subsea robotics they are considered the best compared to their peers . ased on recent news my understanding is the most urgent needs for the the US military to address is a US Navy buildout given that China shipbuilding capacity vastly outstrips the the US at this point and they have been they have been making inroads in gaining control over critical global sea infrastructure across the world note this was the reason Venezuela mattered ... Panama isthmus ... oil is simply a means of saying this military incursion will not_cost the taxpayer and it is also the reason why Greenland matters . b Reclaiming dominance in the Artic Circle where China has been mapping the seafloor like mad . So bottom line is US is completely dominant in Space Missiles and Air but sea is more dicey than anything else . I expect spend going forward here to be very aggressive . So back to OII ... compare is to OIH oil services companies and it trades basically in tandem with that . It also has an oil services multiple of 1x ev sales and 5x ev ebidtda . However what they call AdTech has long been the fastest growing segment . Here is some of what they are capable of . Now to the interesting part The March DoD Contract . In March 2025 they received a Maritime Mobility System that they simply list as largest initial contract value in the company ’ s history . The specific dollar amount for that award remains undisclosed due to its sensitive nature with the U.S. Department of Defense . Note this is a serious company they make about 3b in rev a year . They dont play any games . In other words there is no_reason for them to play coy and tease shareholders . In Q1 2025 they stated AdTech margins took a hit as they took on readiness costs for this new contract . Bottom line the company is making the shift from being a subcontractor a partmaker to the lead company managing an entire military program in one of the hottest and most urgent areas of DoD defense spend . Whats this worth if the market views it as a robotics and defense pure play What are the comps here Well right now the only decent comp is Kraken . Which is now a 2b ev off of 20m in quarterly rev . Again OII is only 3b ev against 750m in quarterly revenue . Kraken is looking a 27x sales vs 1x sales for OII . I am not_here to talk shit about Kraken . I think the company is great and could continue to rip . My point is simply this the market is very very thirsty for subsea military tech . So thirsty they seem to form cults around them . This brings me to my other major points the S Korean retail interest . From what I understand this is one of the most influential S Korean retail accounts .. Which is well deserved given the guy way beating the drum on RKLB consistently since early on . He rarely pitches new names and when he does people sit up and listen . In this case the OII post got about 200k views and very enthusiastic responses . After seeing what the S Koreans did to quantum my general heuristic is when they take an early interest in something I reach for the highest strikes possible . In sum if this was given a reasonable multiple of 3x sales and 15x ebidtda this would would be 3x on the commons ... which given the modest IV would translate to 20x on a many of the strikes . And if this were to run to unreasonable valuations which seems to be the case with the other subsea pure plays like Kraken and anything the S Korean retail takes a liking to this could be bar none the trade of the year . Disclosure I have call options from feb to july and strikes from 22.5 to 40 ."

      "title": "The Missing Link in the Semiconductor Supply Chain: Canatu",
      "selftext": "I’ve been researching a small Finnish company called **Canatu**, and it’s one of the most interesting investments I’ve come across in a while. It’s not a semiconductor company, not an AI company, and not a software business. It sits much deeper in the stack, at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on. ***Quick disclaimer:*** *this is a deep-tech, supply-chain-driven idea. It’s not a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics. If that’s not your thing, feel free to skip. Also, none of this is investment advice.* The core of the thesis is simple: advanced chips are now constrained by physics, not software. As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography, the limiting factor is no longer design, but materials. When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers, even microscopic weaknesses become billion-dollar problems. At the center of this process is the photomask, the blueprint of the chip. To protect it from contamination, EUV machines use an ultra-thin membrane called a pellicle. If a single dust particle hits the mask, yield can collapse instantly. Pellicles are therefore mandatory, but existing silicon-based pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases. This is where Canatu enters the picture. They’ve developed carbon-nanotube (CNT) pellicles that can withstand far higher heat, deform far less, and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions. As EUV systems transition toward High-NA EUV, those properties shift from nice to have to necessary. What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don’t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer. Instead, they’re trying to scale via a licensing + tool model: * Reactor sales (specialized production equipment) * Proprietary consumables (inputs needed to run the reactor) * Per-unit licensing fees (royalty for each pellicle produced) So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity, while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard. That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables, not permanent components. As EUV power rises, pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases. Even if High-NA EUV is a minority of wafer volume, it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate. From a market structure perspective, this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV. Think ARM rather than Intel, or Entegris rather than TSMC. If chips are made on ASML machines, something must sit between the photons and the mask, and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles. There are also real validation signals. Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST, a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung’s ecosystem. Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients (commonly speculated as Samsung + TSMC). Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly. One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV, because this is where the non-linear upside comes from. The key insight is that pellicle demand does not scale with wafer volume, but with exposure intensity. High-NA tools use higher source power, more EUV layers per wafer, and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles, which shortens their usable life. In practical terms, a High-NA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a Low-NA tool. When you combine a slow but steady increase in High-NA share with higher burn rates, you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption. Even under conservative assumptions, my model shows pellicle demand in leading-edge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as High-NA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade. This is still a small-cap (\\~€300M), listed on Nasdaq First North Finland, it is a SPAC, so some future dilution from warrants and earn-outs is expected. That said, I find the asymmetry compelling. This isn’t a bet on which AI company wins. It’s a bet that physics does not negotiate, and that when an industry hits hard material limits, small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable. I’m curious how others here view this kind of deep supply-chain infrastructure play, especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience. Happy to be challenged.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been researching a small Finnish company called Canatu and it ’ s one of the most interesting investments I ’ ve come across in a while . It ’ s not_a semiconductor company not_an AI company and not_a software business . It sits much deeper in the stack at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on . Quick disclaimer this is a deeptech supplychaindriven idea . It ’ s not_a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics . If that ’ s not_your thing feel free to skip . Also none of this is investment advice . The core of the thesis is simple advanced chips are now constrained by physics not_software . As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography the limiting factor is no_longer design but materials . When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers even microscopic weaknesses become billiondollar problems . At the center of this process is the photomask the blueprint of the chip . To protect it from contamination EUV machines use an ultrathin membrane called a pellicle . If a single dust particle hits the mask yield can collapse instantly . Pellicles are therefore mandatory but existing siliconbased pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases . This is where Canatu enters the picture . They ’ ve developed carbonnanotube CNT pellicles that can withstand far higher heat deform far less and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions . As EUV systems transition toward HighNA EUV those properties shift from nice to have to necessary . What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don ’ t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer . Instead they ’ re trying to scale via a licensing tool model Reactor sales specialized production equipment Proprietary consumables inputs needed to run the reactor Perunit licensing fees royalty for each pellicle produced So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard . That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables not_permanent components . As EUV power rises pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases . Even if HighNA EUV is a minority of wafer volume it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate . From a market structure perspective this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV . Think ARM rather than Intel or Entegris rather than TSMC . If chips are made on ASML machines something must sit between the photons and the mask and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles . There are also real validation signals . Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung ’ s ecosystem . Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients commonly speculated as Samsung TSMC . Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly . One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from LowNA to HighNA EUV because this is where the nonlinear upside comes from . The key insight is that pellicle demand does not_scale with wafer volume but with exposure intensity . HighNA tools use higher source power more EUV layers per wafer and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles which shortens their usable life . In practical terms a HighNA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a LowNA tool . When you combine a slow but steady increase in HighNA share with higher burn rates you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption . Even under conservative assumptions my model shows pellicle demand in leadingedge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as HighNA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade . This is still a smallcap €300M listed on Nasdaq First North Finland it is a SPAC so some future dilution from warrants and earnouts is expected . That said I find the asymmetry compelling . This isn ’ t a bet on which AI company wins . It ’ s a bet that physics does not_negotiate and that when an industry hits hard material limits small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable . I ’ m curious how others here view this kind of deep supplychain infrastructure play especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience . Happy to be challenged ."

      "selftext": "*Preface:* I am not looking for financial advice, I will continue to do my own research, I am mainly looking for new funds to explore and expand my perspectives on my strategy. I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments, even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor and/or the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in. I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction, so I am hoping that I can do that here. I’ll also say upfront: Bogleheads, I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult, but I am hoping to avoid that debate here. Thank you in advance. All of my money is now with Fidelity. I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far, especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees. **Current balances:** * Roth IRA: \\~$90k * 401k: \\~$95k * Taxable (TOD): \\~$18k **Current allocations:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 25% FDCPX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 65% FSELX * 25% FXAIX * 10% AGTHX (legacy holding from American Funds) I’m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy, but I’m starting to think more about diversification. I’m especially curious whether there are any non-tech or non-semiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong long-term returns. I know I want to replace FDCPX, since it’s also tech-heavy and overlaps with FSELX, I am just not sure with what yet. I’ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX, but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX, which appears more growth- and tech-concentrated. **Restructure plan as of now:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 15% FSENX * 10% FFFCX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 40% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 20% FSENX * 10% AGTHX * 5% FFFCX I’m interested in hearing how others think about this - not necessarily what to do, but how to think about it, although I am open to some suggestions.",

      "selftext_processed": "Preface I am not_looking for financial advice I will continue to do my own research I am mainly looking for new funds to explore and expand my perspectives on my strategy . I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor andor the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in . I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction so I am hoping that I can do that here . I ’ ll also say upfront Bogleheads I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult but I am hoping to avoid that debate here . Thank you in advance . All of my money is now with Fidelity . I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees . Current balances Roth IRA $ 90k 401k $ 95k Taxable TOD $ 18k Current allocations Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 25 % FDCPX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 65 % FSELX 25 % FXAIX 10 % AGTHX legacy holding from American Funds I ’ m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy but I ’ m starting to think more about diversification . I ’ m especially curious whether there are any nontech or nonsemiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong longterm returns . I know I want to replace FDCPX since it ’ s also techheavy and overlaps with FSELX I am just not_sure with what yet . I ’ ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX which appears more growth and techconcentrated . Restructure plan as of now Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 15 % FSENX 10 % FFFCX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 40 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 20 % FSENX 10 % AGTHX 5 % FFFCX I ’ m interested in hearing how others think about this not_necessarily what to do but how to think about it although I am open to some suggestions ."

      "selftext": "I’m newish to investing. I’m looking for something that I feel should exist but I can’t find it. I want to see what ETF component stocks affected today’s pricing change the most. Something like the top 10 positive contributors and the top 10 negative contributors by weight to that ETF. If, for instance, stock A is 5% of the ETF and it went up 8%, it would have contributed +0.4% to the fund’s performance. If stock B is 1% of the fund, and went down by 20%, it would have contributed -0.2%. So, if VOO is down, why? Did Nvidia drop a fair amount and everything else was stable, or did all the banks drop due to a regulation change, etc? I can find S&P 500 movers but, since they are not weighted, it doesn’t tell the story. Not to mention I am looking for this for any given ETF. Does this exist and my searches suck? Does this not exist because it’s solved another way?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building my portfolio for a few years now, but with the current sentiment around an AI bubble, I’m starting to feel over-leveraged in tech. Currently sitting on about $70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy. Portfolio Breakdown: • VOO: $30k (Taxable) • Tencent (TCEHY): $10k • Roth IRA: $20k (Broad market ETFs) • Misc: $10k in individual stocks The Concern: Between VOO’s heavy weighting in mag-seven/AI and my Tencent position, my exposure to a tech correction is significant. I’m trying to decide the best way to \"crash-proof\" without being an emotional seller. Specifically: 1. Stop-Losses vs. Hedging: Does anyone actually use limit sells/stop-losses for long-term holds like VOO, or is the risk of being \"stopped out\" during a flash dip too high? 2. The Tencent Position: It’s a large chunk of my individual holdings. Given the current macro environment, would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector? 3. Strategy: For those who think we are in a bubble, are you staying the course with the S&P 500, or are you moving toward a higher bond/cash position to buy a potential dip? Not looking to \"time the market\" perfectly, just want to ensure I'm not being reckless by holding through a potential 2000-style tech pop.",

Currently sitting on about $ 70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy . Portfolio Breakdown • VOO $ 30k Taxable • Tencent TCEHY $ 10k • Roth IRA $ 20k Broad market ETFs • Misc $ 10k in individual stocks The Concern Between VOO ’ s heavy weighting in magsevenAI and my Tencent position my exposure to a tech correction is significant . I ’ m trying to decide the best way to crashproof without being an emotional seller . Specifically 1 . StopLosses vs . Hedging Does anyone actually use limit sellsstoplosses for longterm holds like VOO or is the risk of being stopped out during a flash dip too high 2 . The Tencent Position It ’ s a large chunk of my individual holdings . Given the current macro environment would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector 3 . Strategy For those who think we are in a bubble are you staying the course with the SP 500 or are you moving toward a higher bondcash position to buy a potential dip Not_looking to time the market perfectly just want to ensure Im not_being reckless by holding through a potential 2000style tech pop ."

To train and run large-scale AI, you also need: \\- Infrastructure (data centers, networking, cooling) \\- Energy (significant power to run the systems) This means that the economic upside isn’t limited to the big tech names. Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues. AI is more then digital, it’s physical, capital-intensive, and energy-dependant. Do you think the real AI winners are the mega-caps everyone knows, or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies?",

To train and run largescale AI you also need Infrastructure data centers networking cooling Energy significant power to run the systems This means that the economic upside isn ’ t limited to the big tech names . Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues . AI is more then digital it ’ s physical capitalintensive and energydependant . Do you think the real AI winners are the megacaps everyone knows or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies"

      "selftext": "Selling VUG in taxable account to rebalance I’m 27 and have about $27,000 in a taxable brokerage account with Robinhood. I was investing 50/30/20 in VOO/VUG/VXUS, and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance. I would like to now aim for a 70/30 split in VOO/VXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth, especially with a looming tech bubble. My question is, should I: 1) sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOO/VXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15% capital gains bracket based on my standard income? 2) sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop, and keep investing in VTI going forward? 3) not touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOO/VXUS or VTI/VXUS moving forward? Best I can figure is about $150 in taxes from capital gains, which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that’s down $144. Is that all not worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me? Edit: I got my tax loss harvesting wrong, my gains from VUG are about $1000 so the -$144 from the stock does very little.",

      "selftext": "Back in early October, I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $637, most people said I was crazy, then ironically, that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later. Here we are three months later, and we are just about at that level again. So now what? With the recent batch of earnings, it does appear the market is building strength, but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build. Maybe we top out here, or maybe resistance breaks, only to produce a throw over, which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure. Other issues I’m seeing… # Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle. Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets. A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally. On the other hand, when the liquidity dries up, markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong. Many traders don’t look at liquidity at all, others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening, but that’s only part of the story. Another important tool is the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility, commonly referred to as RRP. This program allows large financial institutions, especially money market funds, to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities. Last year, markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system. Essentially, RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process. Take a look at RRP now… [ That cushion is now essentially gone. Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today. That is essentially nothing. When the tank is empty, it becomes concerning. The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone, and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward; this is generally negative for stocks. # Put/Call Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the put/call ratio. This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option. When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection. Being that this is a contrary an indicator, this often marks market bottoms. Low readings, generally below 0.55, signal complacency and excessive optimism, which tend to show up near market tops. Right now, the equity put call ratio is at .54, so yeah, it’s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon. # XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) vs. Consumer Staples (XLP). XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food, beverages, and household products. Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment. XLY represents more discretionary spending, including companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Home Depot. These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances. When XLY outperforms XLP, it signals a risk on environment. Consumers are spending freely, and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market. When XLP starts to outperform XLY, it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities. That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign, even if the broader market is still climbing. See Chart... [ We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary. That shift does not mean a selloff is about to happen. Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build. However, it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface. As of late January 2026, XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY. When you combine that with a put/call ratio hovering near complacent levels, it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising. Most people probably don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 9-11 is quickly approaching, but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around. You should digest this information however you wish. There’s no reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other, but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February, which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years, is simply good financial positioning.",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in early October I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $ 637 most people said I was crazy then ironically that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later . Here we are three months later and we are just about at that level again . So now what With the recent batch of earnings it does appear the market is building strength but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build . Maybe we top out here or maybe resistance breaks only to produce a throw over which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure . Other issues I ’ m seeing… Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle . Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets . A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally . On the other hand when the liquidity dries up markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong . Many traders don ’ t look at liquidity at all others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening but that ’ s only part of the story . Another important tool is the Federal Reserve ’ s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility commonly referred to as RRP . This program allows large financial institutions especially money market funds to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities . Last year markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system . Essentially RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process . Take a look at RRP now… That cushion is now essentially gone . Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $ 2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today . That is essentially nothing_When the tank is empty it becomes concerning . The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward this is generally negative for stocks . PutCall Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the putcall ratio . This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option . When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection . Being that this is a contrary an indicator this often marks market bottoms . Low readings generally below 0.55 signal complacency and excessive optimism which tend to show up near market tops . Right now the equity put call ratio is at .54 so yeah it ’ s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon . XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary XLY vs. Consumer Staples XLP . XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food beverages and household products . Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment . XLY represents more discretionary spending including companies like Amazon Tesla and Home Depot . These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances . When XLY outperforms XLP it signals a risk on environment . Consumers are spending freely and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market . When XLP starts to outperform XLY it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities . That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign even if the broader market is still climbing . See Chart ... We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary . That shift does not_mean a selloff is about to happen . Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build . However it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface . As of late January 2026 XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY . When you combine that with a putcall ratio hovering near complacent levels it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising . Most people probably don ’ t even know what I ’ m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 911 is quickly approaching but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around . You should digest this information however you wish . There ’ s no_reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years is simply good financial positioning ."

      "selftext": "January is almost over, which makes this a decent point to reflect on how 2026 investing goals are holding up after the initial planning phase. Many investors start the year with clear intentions, but after a few weeks in, market noise and real-life constraints tend to test those plans. Curious how this is playing out for others: * Are you still aligned with the goals you set at the start of the year? * Have you already adjusted your strategy based on new information or constraints? * Or did you realize some goals weren’t realistic and reset entirely? From an investing perspective, where is your current focus leaning? * increasing consistency / discipline * reducing risk or exposure * building cash or dry powder * simplifying portfolio structure * reassessing overall strategy There’s no single “correct” path, but early reflection often prevents bigger mistakes later in the year. Interested to hear how others are thinking about this now that January is nearly behind us.",

      "title": "The Block (SQ) stock risk assessment :",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10-Ks and other news. I usually run it on companies I’m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks. I recently ran it on Block (SQ) given the recent volatility and the \"AI pivot and Crypto\" narrative. While the stock has momentum, the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines. I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them. 1. The \"Value Destruction\" Gap (ROIC vs. WACC) This was the loudest signal. This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): \\\\\\~0.76% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): \\\\\\~8.21% Despite reporting accounting profits, the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now. Operational returns aren't covering the cost of capital. Usually, you see this in dying industries, not \"growth\" fintechs. Is this just temporary due to the restructuring, or is the core payments business losing efficiency? 2. Cash Flow Quality: Organic or Accounting Magic? Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible: jumping from 101M to 1.7B (2024). The Red Flag: The tool flagged that this wasn't driven purely by higher sales. It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital. Receivables dropped from $7.19B → $5.67B. Payables fell from $141M → $118M. Retained Earnings swung wildly from -528M to +2.3B. This suggests the cash flow boom is largely \"one-off\" balance sheet timing (squeezing customers/suppliers) rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power. 3. The $11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill: $11.4B Intangibles: $1.4B Total: \\\\\\~35% of Total Assets. With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI, and away from legacy integrations, the tool flagged a high risk of impairment. If the acquisitions that make up that $11B (like Afterpay) underperform, we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity. 4. Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction. Long-term debt jumped from $4.97B to $6.4B. Simultaneously, they spent \\\\\\~$1.17B on equity repayments/buybacks. Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76% seems like questionable capital allocation. Conclusion: The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency (ROIC) is surprisingly weak. For those tracking SQ: Do you view the ROIC/WACC spread as a dealbreaker, or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffs/restructuring fully take effect?",

While the stock has momentum the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines . I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them . 1 . The Value Destruction Gap ROIC vs. WACC This was the loudest signal . This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost ROIC Return on Invested Capital 0.76 % WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital 8.21 % Despite reporting accounting profits the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now . Operational returns arent covering the cost of capital . Usually you see this in dying industries not_growth fintechs . Is this just temporary due to the restructuring or is the core payments business losing efficiency 2 . Cash Flow Quality Organic or Accounting Magic Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible jumping from 101M to 1.7B 2024 . The Red Flag The tool flagged that this wasnt driven purely by higher sales . It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital . Receivables dropped from $ 7.19B → $ 5.67B . Payables fell from $ 141M → $ 118M . Retained Earnings swung wildly from 528M to 2.3B . This suggests the cash flow boom is largely oneoff balance sheet timing squeezing customerssuppliers rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power . 3 . The $ 11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill $ 11.4B Intangibles $ 1.4B Total 35 % of Total Assets . With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI and away from legacy integrations the tool flagged a high risk of impairment . If the acquisitions that make up that $ 11B like Afterpay underperform we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity . 4 . Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction . Longterm debt jumped from $ 4.97B to $ 6.4B . Simultaneously they spent $ 1.17B on equity repaymentsbuybacks . Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76 % seems like questionable capital allocation . Conclusion The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency ROIC is surprisingly weak . For those tracking SQ Do you view the ROICWACC spread as a dealbreaker or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffsrestructuring fully take effect"

The CapEx from AI is what is made Wallstreet nervous and is weighing on their reported profit, but that should to be priced in with the fall below 600 last year. (although this might raise concerns for some). I think once revenue is posted, investors will be put at ease. The standout number is a staggering 20% increase in quarterly revenue YoY and it is what catches my eye that the fall from last quarter's CapEx made META actually undervalued. With a solid EPS, they won't miss due to a one time tax, all the analysts are coming in with price targets around 800 or above for META as well. To me, all this reads as a company ready to reclaim its proper valuation (currently undervalued). With some good guidance from Zuck, I am setting a personal price target/option exit at $720.

      "title": "Why the current state of the US Dollar is making me uncomfortable",
      "selftext": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession. The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy, evidenced by a 15% depreciation against the Euro since the term began. This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1% and rising geopolitical friction with the EU, which risks a selloff of US Treasuries. My thesis suggests two likely, yet negative, outcomes: **The Path of Non-Intervention** If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked, we risk a surge in commodity prices (already underway), leading to cost-push inflation. While oil supply may mitigate some shocks, a severe spike could threaten the solvency of import-dependent nations. Furthermore, this dynamic encourages \"currency wars,\" where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive. This erosion of trust could destroy international trade, ultimately leading to stagflation and recession. **The Path of Delayed Intervention** If the US government eventually intervenes, it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late. This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures, similar to the \"Volcker Shock\" hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation. Alternatively, they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity. Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable. I'm struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar, I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade, I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy. I am seeking feedback on this assessment: Is this thesis economically sound, or am I overestimating the risks? I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the US's narrative might make sense.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession . The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy evidenced by a 15 % depreciation against the Euro since the term began . This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1 % and rising geopolitical friction with the EU which risks a selloff of US Treasuries . My thesis suggests two likely yet negative outcomes The Path of NonIntervention If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked we risk a surge in commodity prices already underway leading to costpush inflation . While oil supply may mitigate some shocks a severe spike could threaten the solvency of importdependent nations . Furthermore this dynamic encourages currency wars where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive . This erosion of trust could destroy international trade ultimately leading to stagflation and recession . The Path of Delayed Intervention If the US government eventually intervenes it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late . This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures similar to the Volcker Shock hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation . Alternatively they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity . Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable . Im struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy . I am seeking feedback on this assessment Is this thesis economically sound or am I overestimating the risks I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the USs narrative might make sense ."

      "selftext": "I have traded mostly stocks, ETFs and Options last year (around 200 executed orders in 2025) with a reasonable level of success (in a bull market anyone is a hero). Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early. I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy: # Overview: * Goal: 20%/year target return * Time horizon: 5 years * Max Drawdown: 25% # Additional constrains: * No single trade above 1% of portfolio total * Per-Ticker Limits: 10% single stock/20% single ETF * Asset type concentration limits: Stocks: 35%/ETFs: 45%/Options: 20% # Sector Allocations (soft limits): * Information Technology: 35% * Energy: 5% * Large Blend: 30% (mostly for indexed ETFs - VOO, etc...) * Other sectors: 30% # How I plan on implement the rules: 1. All assets held must have a stop-loss/trailing stop-loss set at 15%-20% of either current price or entry price (use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value) 2. Option count against underlying ticker concentration - *100 Shares of NVDA + 1 short Put NVDA Contract = 200 share commitment.* 3. If total stock allocation is met, use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20% limit As I'm investing across a range of account types (401K Traditional and Brokerage, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, HSA), there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them. It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage, while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage. I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional. I don't understand Options enough to operate multi-leg strategies so I don't play with them. # Current portfolio: Current stocks held in descending order of value: NVDA, PLTR, NOW, SMCI, CALM, GOOG, IREN, ADBE, OKTA, FISV, SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value: IWB, VOO, MGK, SMH Current open option contracts: Long LEAPS on the following underlying: NVO, NVDA, PLTR, NOK, KLAR, KVUE/A few Covered Calls on SMH, NOW, IREN, OKTA # Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits, I would like to get feedback on the overall framework. Specific questions: \\- Should I tighten up the stop-loss limit on Stocks/ETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stop-loss limits for LEAPS/Options - keeping the 25% drawdown total? \\- Should I consider stashing 5% os total invested in corporate bonds (ETF along the lines of IGIB) as dry powder to buy significant dips? \\- Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made? \\- Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "I have traded mostly stocks ETFs and Options last year around 200 executed orders in 2025 with a reasonable level of success in a bull market anyone is a hero . Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early . I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy Overview Goal 20 % year target return Time horizon 5 years Max Drawdown 25 % Additional constrains No_single trade above 1 % of portfolio total PerTicker Limits 10 % single stock20 % single ETF Asset type concentration limits Stocks 35 % ETFs 45 % Options 20 % Sector Allocations soft limits Information Technology 35 % Energy 5 % Large Blend 30 % mostly for indexed ETFs VOO etc ... Other sectors 30 % How I plan on implement the rules 1 . All assets held must have a stoplosstrailing stoploss set at 15 % 20 % of either current price or entry price use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value 2 . Option count against underlying ticker concentration 100 Shares of NVDA 1 short Put NVDA Contract 200 share commitment . 3 . If total stock allocation is met use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20 % limit As Im investing across a range of account types 401K Traditional and Brokerage Roth IRA Taxable Brokerage HSA there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them . It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage . I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional . I dont understand Options enough to operate multileg strategies so I dont play with them . Current portfolio Current stocks held in descending order of value NVDA PLTR NOW SMCI CALM GOOG IREN ADBE OKTA FISV SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value IWB VOO MGK SMH Current open option contracts Long LEAPS on the following underlying NVO NVDA PLTR NOK KLAR KVUEA few Covered Calls on SMH NOW IREN OKTA Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits I would like to get feedback on the overall framework . Specific questions Should I tighten up the stoploss limit on StocksETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stoploss limits for LEAPSOptions keeping the 25 % drawdown total Should I consider stashing 5 % os total invested in corporate bonds ETF along the lines of IGIB as dry powder to buy significant dips Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience Thanks"

Lets just wait and see, remember you lost nothing until you decide to sell it\" Her: \"Weird\" (Then of course proceeds to play Roblox for hours with at least 3 of her other friends) Anyway, pretty certain i failed on that lesson, but at least planted a seed, oh and her VOO is up 13%, so a lesson was hopefully learned there as well.",

Without getting in those conversations index funds versus individual companies we also bought 1 share of the main company she is familiar with Roblox at $ 130 .... ..... and have since watched it decline 44 % . Her Why dad Me Well It supposedly dropped due to the kids using it less Her But dad every single person i know plays Roblox and everyone is addicted to it . Insert friends name here even SPENDS REAL MONEY on it Me I know that so can not_really explain it but let us just hope your friends start to spend more money on it haha . Lets just wait and see remember you lost nothing_until you decide to sell it Her Weird Then of course proceeds to play Roblox for hours with at least 3 of her other friends Anyway pretty certain i failed on that lesson but at least planted a seed oh and her VOO is up 13 % so a lesson was hopefully learned there as well ."

The latest quarterly results revealed a 46% year-over-year increase in free cash flow for the third quarter of 2025. Its net income fell 13% due to a $260 million one-off expense from the revaluation of an investment that was accounted for using the equity method. Constellation has a strong balance sheet with $2.8 billion in cash reserves. It is trading at 17.1 times free cash flow (FCF), a valuation last seen in September 2014. All the overvaluation of the stock has vanished, and the stock is heavily discounted considering a 27% FCF growth in the nine months of 2025. what do you think?",

While I still have some investments left with US brokers, I'm becoming a Iittle concerned about those, in regards to a much more sudden downward trend than anticipated, and - based on some specialized analysis sites - not to stop, but rather to further accelerate. Thoughts?~~ ~~Edit: maybe I'm not clear. The concern is on the value_in_dollar of US investments, not in the cause of $ tumbling like a baby on the stairs. The so called US market gains are re-evaluated downwards, in a fai/lling currency. IDVY and UBS MSCI ETFs, for example, are at the opposite end, with what I was able to salvage moving to those in the EU, during 2025.~~ ~~Edit 2: so companies become \"more valuable\" on worthless currency. 15% value lost in one year, ongoing political turmoil and incompetent leadership, but things are going just great.~~ Edit 3: great news. The US president just cleared up the issue: “No, I think it’s great,” Trump told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday when asked if he was worried about losses in the dollar that have dragged the world’s premier reserve currency to its weakest level in nearly four years. ***“I think the value of the dollar — look at the business we’re doing. The dollar’s doing great.”*** Never mind original post. /s Edit 4: the amount of bozos who are commenting here, while taking a break from [/r/conservative]( is amazing. 🤣",

While I still have some investments left with US brokers Im becoming a Iittle concerned about those in regards to a much more sudden downward trend than anticipated and based on some specialized analysis sites not_to stop but rather to further accelerate . Thoughts Edit maybe Im not_clear . The concern is on the value_in_dollar of US investments not_in the cause of $ tumbling like a baby on the stairs . The so called US market gains are reevaluated downwards in a failling currency . IDVY and UBS MSCI ETFs for example are at the opposite end with what I was able to salvage moving to those in the EU during 2025 . Edit 2 so companies become more valuable on worthless currency . 15 % value lost in one year ongoing political turmoil and incompetent leadership but things are going just great . Edit 3 great news . The US president just cleared up the issue “ No I think it ’ s great ” Trump told reporters in Iowa on Tuesday when asked if he was worried about losses in the dollar that have dragged the world ’ s premier reserve currency to its weakest level in nearly four years . “ I think the value of the dollar — look at the business we ’ re doing . The dollar ’ s doing great. ” Never_mind original post . s Edit 4 the amount of bozos who are commenting here while taking a break from rconservative is amazing . 🤣"

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during stress periods. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress, depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested?",

      "selftext": "While any specific thoughts on the individual stock (CENX/Century Aluminum) are welcome, I'm also/more broadly interested in how folks handle your unexpected wins that wildly exceed your expectations especially in the realm of small caps where you readily realize you just got lucky. FWIW, my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio -- I am no pro, nor any kind of day trader and mostly, I stick with large/mega caps. Still, I always told myself \"If you can't keep pace with the S&P, you've just got an expensive hobby\". Over 6 years now - I've held my own or better, thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL. Anyway, I don't usually bother with small caps - but \\~3 years ago, I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 2021/2022 infrastructure/manufacturing bills. CENX was one of the names mentioned. I read more - they had some aggressive expansion plans, including some new tech/methods. I did - as I always try to do - pored over the 10-K/10-Qs and thought the finances looked solid. Bought in further in 2024 - quite clear no matter who won the election, such public investment wasn't going away. I wouldn't ask this sort of question about large caps, but small caps... oy. Not a charts guy, but short% creeping towards 20%. CENX missed earnings throughout 2025, but still had an unbelievable year price-wise. Sector averages on P/E, now even growth? Don't look good. And worst of all? \"Materials\" is just not a sector I'm familiar with. My *gut* \\- every ounce of it - says take the money and run... I'm now, total cash basis - up nearly 500%, long on all positions. What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money. However, my gut isn't always very smart. And I'm really just a \"buy-and-hold\" guy. AND - as the title says, I believe in \"cut your weeds, not your flowers\". Like I said, any specific thoughts on it are welcome -- but more broadly, ***especially*** from more seasoned investors. How and when do you decide that even your \"winners\" have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to \"safer\" investments? Or - do you not? Even crashing out - the position here wouldn't hurt me in the grand scheme.",

      "selftext_processed": "While any specific thoughts on the individual stock CENXCentury Aluminum are welcome Im alsomore broadly interested in how folks handle your unexpected wins that wildly exceed your expectations especially in the realm of small caps where you readily realize you just got lucky . FWIW my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio I am no_pro nor any kind of day trader and mostly I stick with largemega caps . Still I always told myself If you cant keep pace with the SP youve just got an expensive hobby . Over 6 years now Ive held my own or better thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL . Anyway I dont usually bother with small caps but 3 years ago I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 20212022 infrastructuremanufacturing bills . CENX was one of the names mentioned . I read more they had some aggressive expansion plans including some new techmethods . I did as I always try to do pored over the 10K10Qs and thought the finances looked solid . Bought in further in 2024 quite clear no_matter who won the election such public investment wasnt going away . I wouldnt ask this sort of question about large caps but small caps ... oy . Not_a charts guy but short % creeping towards 20 % . CENX missed earnings throughout 2025 but still had an unbelievable year pricewise . Sector averages on PE now even growth Dont look good . And worst of all Materials is just not_a sector Im familiar with . My gut every ounce of it says take the money and run ... Im now total cash basis up nearly 500 % long on all positions . What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money . However my gut isnt always very smart . And Im really just a buyandhold guy . AND as the title says I believe in cut your weeds not_your flowers . Like I said any specific thoughts on it are welcome but more broadly especially from more seasoned investors . How and when do you decide that even your winners have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to safer investments Or do you not_Even crashing out the position here wouldnt hurt me in the grand scheme ."

      "selftext": "Back in May of last year when all the tariff stuff was going on I KNEW eventually everything would be going back up. I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever, I said we will never see these lows again. However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $35 down to $30 in 2 days, a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures. Had about $600,000 (I am not even rich, I just had won a lot in sports betting, put it in the market and made even more) and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $29.75. For that amount of futures it is $210,000 for every dollar silver moved, had it gone back up to just $35 it was 2 days ago I would up $1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years, I thought would get to $50 or so and make a killing..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $28 and dropped all the way to $27.54 a low that will never be seen again. At that point I was down $460,000 and all but wiped out = a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD. About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $30.02 for a $50,000 profit. I had no choice, I couldn't take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out, my dreams of holding for the long term was over. I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $100+. I knew it was going back up (i thought maybe $50, never though $100), I knew I wanted to hold it forever. If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $14 million dollars on the 41 contracts. But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up. I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $100 Million dollars on this trade. And that puts me as the #1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub. I know it would happen, I made the trade, and I still lost all my money Have a good day",

I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever I said we will never_see these lows again . However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $ 35 down to $ 30 in 2 days a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures . Had about $ 600000 I am not_even rich I just had won a lot in sports betting put it in the market and made even more and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $ 29.75 . For that amount of futures it is $ 210000 for every dollar silver moved had it gone back up to just $ 35 it was 2 days ago I would up $ 1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years I thought would get to $ 50 or so and make a killing ..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $ 28 and dropped all the way to $ 27.54 a low that will never_be seen again . At that point I was down $ 460000 and all but wiped out a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD . About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not_even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $ 30.02 for a $ 50000 profit . I had no_choice I couldnt take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out my dreams of holding for the long term was over . I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $ 100 . I knew it was going back up i thought maybe $ 50 never_though $ 100 I knew I wanted to hold it forever . If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $ 14 million dollars on the 41 contracts . But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up . I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $ 100 Million dollars on this trade . And that puts me as the 1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub . I know it would happen I made the trade and I still lost all my money Have a good day"

      "selftext": "Hey all, So, just a bit about myself & my investing journey: I'm from Hong Kong & was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were \"gambling\", I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with & had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset. I never started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 & even then, I was a very conservative investor & only invested about US$130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank (HSBC) - I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didn't know how to open an investment account & was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account. (What a waste of an opportunity.) Later that year, I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing (At one point, he wanted to go all in on one stock.) As I was risk averse, I never attempted to try picking stocks with my own money & as it turned out, using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor, my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time - I looked into BYD, NIO, PLTR, MARA, DDD, OCGN, GME. Fast forward 5 years & my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts & reading investing books. I've managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month & the more financial content I consume, the more I realize that I'm more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker. I still haven't started picking stocks & I can't help but beat myself up for not taking the risk back then. The hindsight bias has been brutal & taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return could've been but anyway, would've, could've, should've, I understand Hindsight is 20/20. I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head: * Am I bad at taking risks? * How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner? (Was I too harsh on myself?) * Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking & the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in? * How do I learn from the experience & most importantly, moving forward, how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey & rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias I've been struggling with for some time now? I would love all your feedback & opinions on this & would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share. (It would definitely help a lot!)",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey all So just a bit about myself my investing journey Im from Hong Kong was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad Poor Dad . Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were gambling I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset . I never_started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 even then I was a very conservative investor only invested about US $ 130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank HSBC I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didnt know how to open an investment account was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account . What a waste of an opportunity . Later that year I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing At one point he wanted to go all in on one stock . As I was risk averse I never_attempted to try picking stocks with my own money as it turned out using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time I looked into BYD NIO PLTR MARA DDD OCGN GME . Fast forward 5 years my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts reading investing books . Ive managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month the more financial content I consume the more I realize that Im more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker . I still havent started picking stocks I cant help but beat myself up for not_taking the risk back then . The hindsight bias has been brutal taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return couldve been but anyway wouldve couldve shouldve I understand Hindsight is 2020 . I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head Am I bad at taking risks How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner Was I too harsh on myself Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in How do I learn from the experience most importantly moving forward how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias Ive been struggling with for some time now I would love all your feedback opinions on this would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share . It would definitely help a lot"

      "selftext": "India's oil minister says US-India talks are \"very advanced,\" eyeing a quick sign-off. But Trump's crew is slamming 50% tariffs on Indian goods (punishing Russian oil buys) and criticizing the new EU-India \"mother of all deals.\" Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds? Bearish vibes strong. Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats. Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports: the U.S. has already hammered India with 50% duties on certain goods, while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EU-India FTA as \"financing war against themselves\" through indirect Russia ties, and Trump's broader threats, like 100% tariffs on Canada and 25% on South Korea, could easily escalate the mess. Meanwhile, the EU-India power move, a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6% of goods and boosting EU exports to India, significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts. This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.-China friction even further, putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows. If it lands, it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade (currently \\~$200B), giving U.S. firms better access to India's market amid China decoupling. But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India \"immediate price advantages,\" making U.S. negotiations tougher. what's your take? Is the deal a done thing, or will tariffs kill it?",

But Trumps crew is slamming 50 % tariffs on Indian goods punishing Russian oil buys and criticizing the new EUIndia mother of all deals . Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds Bearish vibes strong . Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats . Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports the U.S. has already hammered India with 50 % duties on certain goods while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EUIndia FTA as financing war against themselves through indirect Russia ties and Trumps broader threats like 100 % tariffs on Canada and 25 % on South Korea could easily escalate the mess . Meanwhile the EUIndia power move a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6 % of goods and boosting EU exports to India significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts . This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.China friction even further putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows . If it lands it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade currently $ 200B giving U.S. firms better access to Indias market amid China decoupling . But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India immediate price advantages making U.S. negotiations tougher . whats your take Is the deal a done thing or will tariffs kill it"

It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults. >The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09% in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage, far below Wall Street's expectations. >This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana, CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12% before the bell. >CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027. >UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $17.75, compared with analysts' average estimate of $17.74, according to data compiled by LSEG. >The company has struggled with higher costs across government-backed ⁠plans for over two years, driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services, specialty drugs and home-health ​services. >For the year, adjusted medical care ratio - the percentage of premiums spent on medical care - was 88.9% compared with 85.5% in 2024. Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1% ⁠for 2025. >The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding, changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends, the company said. >On ⁠an adjusted basis, UnitedHealth earned a fourth-quarter profit of $2.11 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.10, ‌according to data compiled by LSEG.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source UnitedHealth on Tuesday forecast 2026 adjusted profit slightly above analysts estimates in a sign that medical costcontrol measures under CEO Stephen ​Hemsley were beginning to reap results . Hemsley who returned as CEO in May to restore ‌investor and consumer trust in the healthcare behemoth has been working to steer the company out of a ‌difficult period that included the murder of a top executive a surge in medical costs a federal probe and Americans anger at insurance industry practices . The company has been aiming for a return to growth in 2026 but expects a challenging recovery in its Medicaid business for ⁠lowerincome Americans due to a ‌mismatch between payment rates and costs for medical services . It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults . The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09 % in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage far below Wall Streets expectations . This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12 % before the bell . CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April . If the current proposal holds the rate increase would result in more than $ 700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027 . UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $ 17.75 compared with analysts average estimate of $ 17.74 according to data compiled by LSEG . The company has struggled with higher costs across governmentbacked ⁠plans for over two years driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services specialty drugs and homehealth ​services . For the year adjusted medical care ratio the percentage of premiums spent on medical care was 88.9 % compared with 85.5 % in 2024 . Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1 % ⁠for 2025 . The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends the company said . On ⁠an adjusted basis UnitedHealth earned a fourthquarter profit of $ 2.11 per share compared with analysts average estimate of $ 2.10 ‌according to data compiled by LSEG ."
