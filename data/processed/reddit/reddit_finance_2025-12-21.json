Any idea on if selling my shares and purchasing long term 15 $ out of the money calls on the same stock is considered a wash sale"

      "selftext": "I could have chosen a way better entry for this bearish trade if I had waited just a day longer. Hopped on on this INTC put after it pumped a ridiculous amount due to rumors of future partnership with AAPL. My justification was that sentiment based pumps usually fail to hold, especially if it's Intel. The first day or two was a little disheartening, but it didn't go too deep in the red since the option had about 3 months left. Because the theta was negligible I decided to hold on to it for a few weeks. Soon enough, the reversal happened and the position gradually slipped into green territory. The exit spot couldn't be more perfect though. About 3:30 pm on Wednesday when bearish ai sentiment was in full swing. Looks like the bearish trend reverses right after my exit (except for a wick below 36 the next day).",

My justification was that sentiment based pumps usually fail to hold especially if its Intel . The first day or two was a little disheartening but it didnt go too deep in the red since the option had about 3 months left . Because the theta was negligible I decided to hold on to it for a few weeks . Soon enough the reversal happened and the position gradually slipped into green territory . The exit spot couldnt be more perfect though . About 330 pm on Wednesday when bearish ai sentiment was in full swing . Looks like the bearish trend reverses right after my exit except for a wick below 36 the next day ."

      "selftext": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as I'm reading the posts, the majority are already sitting on $500k, $1.5 million or more. Great! I'm happy for them but to the average person who doesn't make over $100k a year, how can one achieve this? It's never too late to start investing, I fully understand the concept. Are ETFs the answer? I read something that said at the age of 40, I would need to invest $4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably. If I put $4k a month into investing I'd be living on the street and the family would go hungry. Is the move to gamble on a penny stock? I'm just genuinely curious to see what others would do. We can't turn back the clock and start investing young. What's the play? Thank you *Edit- Reading through the comments, there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts. I'm thinking that outside of an RRSP (I'm in Canada), possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada. I will continue to read the comments and take some time to learn about some things being mentioned.",

      "title": "PCT $120k YOLO - I’ve been early before",
      "selftext": "This one will likely go over this sub’s collective head, but I’d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years. I’ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently (6 stocks now account for 80% of my port) and $PCT became one of my large long term bets (was a smaller position before) after the recent selloff, after what was a positive earnings call, that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff + shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock. IMO this should hopefully be my best most “boring” multi bagger in my long term portfolio. For those unfamiliar, PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin, that is essentially as good as virgin plastic. Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years, but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton, Ohio plant. That plant is the “proof” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product. Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta, GA and the 3 other planned international plants (more planned for the future). PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online, those plants are already spoken for. Making big enterprise decisions don’t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves. I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with P&G, so this is not just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked. I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side. Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they’re not going to want to place orders until they are certain it’s officially designated as a “recycled” material. Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term. Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not enough supply to meet their demand. Thus, these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $.80/lb. This means that PCT will not only be able to meet a supply/demand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is in-line with what these companies are spending on credits already. PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board, Val Mars, who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling. MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose. Any future partnerships with MARS aside, upon joining the board, Val was quoted saying “It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life. As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth”. From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder, this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar (ATT executive) joined their board and was a big source of credibility/validity to the market. The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo. When proven out, which should hopefully not be too long, all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling. Some future potential valuation thoughts: After the Augusta plant is operational, they could be doing as much as $1/lb in EBITDA. If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 25-30x. That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 (Ironton, Augusta, Thailand, Antwerp), PCT is potentially a $25/30 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 20-30 bln lbs per year. TLDR: One of the old school SPACS that’s actually a real company, but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast aside/low volume ignored. They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon. If they execute their vision I can see this being a 10-20X from the current $1.5B MC valuation within the next 3-5ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 25-50X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned. They’re a green, US company, so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well. I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn’t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well. Best of luck out there regards 10,500 shares 40 x 3/26 calls “Think left and think right, think low and think high, oh the thinks you can think up if only you try” - Dr Seuss",

      "selftext_processed": "This one will likely go over this sub ’ s collective head but I ’ d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years . I ’ ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently 6 stocks now account for 80 % of my port and $ PCT became one of my large long term bets was a smaller position before after the recent selloff after what was a positive earnings call that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock . IMO this should hopefully be my best most “ boring ” multi bagger in my long term portfolio . For those unfamiliar PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin that is essentially as good as virgin plastic . Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton Ohio plant . That plant is the “ proof ” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product . Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta GA and the 3 other planned international plants more planned for the future . PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online those plants are already spoken for . Making big enterprise decisions don ’ t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves . I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with PG so this is not_just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked . I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side . Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they ’ re not_going to want to place orders until they are certain it ’ s officially designated as a “ recycled ” material . Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term . Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not_enough supply to meet their demand . Thus these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $ .80lb . This means that PCT will not_only be able to meet a supplydemand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is inline with what these companies are spending on credits already . PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board Val Mars who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling . MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose . Any future partnerships with MARS aside upon joining the board Val was quoted saying “ It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life . As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth ” . From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar ATT executive joined their board and was a big source of credibilityvalidity to the market . The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo . When proven out which should hopefully not_be too long all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling . Some future potential valuation thoughts After the Augusta plant is operational they could be doing as much as $ 1lb in EBITDA . If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 2530x . That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 Ironton Augusta Thailand Antwerp PCT is potentially a $ 2530 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 2030 bln lbs per year . TLDR One of the old school SPACS that ’ s actually a real company but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast asidelow volume ignored . They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon . If they execute their vision I can see this being a 1020X from the current $ 1.5B MC valuation within the next 35ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 2550X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned . They ’ re a green US company so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well . I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn ’ t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well . Best of luck out there regards 10500 shares 40 x 326 calls “ Think left and think right think low and think high oh the thinks you can think up if only you try ” Dr Seuss"

My question is how should I approach entering the market right now? Should I continue to DCA, lump sum it, or some hybrid approach? My worry is a drastic market pullback.

At the moment I only have 22k in VUAG and 10k in VWRP but plan to go 100% VWRP going forward as there's already 60% overlap towards US. I'm based in the UK, investing in a Stocks ISA with trading 212 and have currently maxed out my ISA allowance this year. As I'm also invested into a Lifetime ISA, I'm therefore only limited to 16k per year towards Stocks but wondered if my portfolio is good for long term growth & returns or if I should add individual stocks to get higher returns? At the moment I've got a \"set and forget\" approach - ideally aiming for an earlier retirement at 55-60 years old but have started reading & listening to more things stock market related.",

      "selftext": "TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. # Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. # Methods **Data Processing Steps:** 1. Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) 2. Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3. Returns calculated as percentage changes: r\\_t = (P\\_t / P\\_(t-1) - 1) × 100 4. Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5. Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization # Results **Key Findings:** * RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) * Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature * RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) * This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts [Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.]( [Cross-correlation function revealing peak correlation at -49-day lag, indicating RS3 bonds leadS&P 500 by 49 days.]( [30-day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive early-warning system.]( The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship **strengthened significantly post-2022**, potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior. [90-day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time.]( Both markets exhibit fat-tailed distributions, with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails. This amplification of sentiment signals, combined with the 49-day lead time, creates a potentially valuable early warning system. [Distribution of daily returns showing RS3’s fat-tailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator.]( # Trading Strategy Based on these trends, the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data: **BUY Signal (Increase S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average increases by ≥3% * Action: Begin accumulating S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 * Success Rate: 63.3% (based on historical backtesting) **SELL Signal (Reduce S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average decreases by ≥3% * Action: Begin reducing S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to decline around Day 49 * Success Rate: 39.1% (inverse - signals to avoid market) **HOLD Signal:** * When: RS3 bond moves less than ±3% over 30 days * Action: Maintain current allocation * Rationale: Insufficient signal strength # Software and Environment **Core Tools:** * R 4.3.0 * R Markdown * XeLaTeX * Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance **R Packages:** * quantmod * tidyverse * jsonlite * lubridate * zoo * ggplot2 * gridExtra * httr * knitr * kableExtra * scales",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR RuneScape bond prices might predict SP 500 movements 7 weeks in advance r0.43 p0.001 . Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets . This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the worlds most elaborate coincidence . Further research needed . Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and SP 500 performance between Dec. 2020 Dec. 2025 . The data suggests something unexpected virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes . RS3 bond price movements consistently lead SP 500 changes by approximately 49 days suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets . Methods Data Processing Steps 1 . Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds via WeirdGloop API and SP 500 via quantmod 2 . Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3 . Returns calculated as percentage changes r_t P_t P_t1 1 × 100 4 . Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5 . Normalization performed using minmax scaling for visualization Results Key Findings RS3 bond price movements consistently precede SP 500 changes by 49 days r 0.428 p 0.001 Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022 suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the SP 500 daily SD 2.35 % vs 1.09 % This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive earlywarning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading SP 500 movements by approximately49 days . Crosscorrelation function revealing peak correlation at 49day lag indicating RS3 bonds leadSP 500 by 49 days . 30day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive earlywarning system . The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship strengthened significantly post2022 potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior . 90day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time . Both markets exhibit fattailed distributions with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails . This amplification of sentiment signals combined with the 49day lead time creates a potentially valuable early warning system . Distribution of daily returns showing RS3 ’ s fattailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator . Trading Strategy Based on these trends the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data BUY Signal Increase SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average increases by ≥3 % Action Begin accumulating SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 Success Rate 63.3 % based on historical backtesting SELL Signal Reduce SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average decreases by ≥3 % Action Begin reducing SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to decline around Day 49 Success Rate 39.1 % inverse signals to avoid market HOLD Signal When RS3 bond moves less than ±3 % over 30 days Action Maintain current allocation Rationale Insufficient signal strength Software and Environment Core Tools R 4.3.0 R Markdown XeLaTeX Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance R Packages quantmod tidyverse jsonlite lubridate zoo ggplot2 gridExtra httr knitr kableExtra scales"

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been comparing two very different sectors: Microsoft ($MSFT) vs Procter & Gamble ($PG). Both are strong companies, but the risk/reward and growth narratives are very different. Microsoft highlights: • Cloud growth continues with Azure • AI integration could accelerate revenue across Office, search, and enterprise solutions • Forward P/E ~30x, strong margins, massive cash flow • Risks: Competition in AI/Cloud, macro slowdown Procter & Gamble highlights: • Steady revenue from consumer staples • Inflation-resistant products and strong pricing power • Forward P/E ~25x, lower growth but stable cash flow • Risks: Slower growth, sensitivity to commodity costs My take: Tech ($MSFT) offers more upside with AI tailwinds but comes with higher volatility. Consumer staples ($PG) are defensive, lower risk, but growth is limited. A balanced portfolio might include both, but I’m curious what this community thinks about positioning for 2026.",

      "selftext": "Moderna still trades like a “pandemic leftover,” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story. A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time, and the market hasn’t fully caught up. 1. Pharma valuations are elevated, and M&A appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs. With valuations stretched across legacy pharma, innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive. Moderna has scalable tech, validated regulatory pathways, and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if M&A ramps in 2026. 2. COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play, but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu. Combined COVID/flu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land. 3. Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology. Early results were strong, phase 3 studies are underway, and oncology could become a major revenue driver. If approvals come through, this alone forces a valuation rethink. 4. Global regulators are moving independently. A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe, the UK, Australia, Canada, and Japan/Korea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA. These regions are shifting toward more science-first healthcare policies. For a global company like Moderna, that means faster paths to market, diversified approval risk, and earlier revenue realization. 5. Global investment in next-gen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness, mRNA technology, and precision medicine. Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives. My take: When you stack all this together, the $200 thesis doesn’t sound far-fetched. The market still prices Moderna like it has one product. The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise. On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative, and short interest has been sticky for months. If any combination of oncology data, seasonal vaccine stability, or accelerated ex-US approvals hits at the same time, pessimism could unwind quickly. Not predicting fireworks, but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land. Curious what everyone thinks: Which catalyst hits first? Oncology readouts? Seasonal vaccine clarity? Faster ex-US approvals?",

      "selftext_processed": "Moderna still trades like a “ pandemic leftover ” but the fundamentals and global environment tell a much different story . A lot of major catalysts are starting to stack at the same time and the market hasn ’ t fully caught up . 1 . Pharma valuations are elevated and MA appetite is rising Big pharma is sitting on cash and facing steep patent cliffs . With valuations stretched across legacy pharma innovative biotech platforms look increasingly attractive . Moderna has scalable tech validated regulatory pathways and a global footprint which makes it a logical strategic target if MA ramps in 2026 . 2 . COVID and flu demand is stabilizing into a predictable seasonal model The market still prices Moderna like a declining pandemic play but COVID is sliding into a steady seasonal pattern similar to flu . Combined COVIDflu vaccines have the potential to generate recurring annual revenue once results land . 3 . Cancer vaccine development keeps gaining momentum The individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine program is one of the most watched programs in oncology . Early results were strong phase 3 studies are underway and oncology could become a major revenue driver . If approvals come through this alone forces a valuation rethink . 4 . Global regulators are moving independently . A huge underappreciated catalyst Europe the UK Australia Canada and JapanKorea are increasingly making their own regulatory calls instead of waiting on the FDA . These regions are shifting toward more sciencefirst healthcare policies . For a global company like Moderna that means faster paths to market diversified approval risk and earlier revenue realization . 5 . Global investment in nextgen biotech platforms Governments are putting real money behind pandemic preparedness mRNA technology and precision medicine . Moderna sits right at the center of those initiatives . My take When you stack all this together the $ 200 thesis doesn ’ t sound farfetched . The market still prices Moderna like it has one product . The pipeline and regulatory landscape suggest otherwise . On the short interest side… Sentiment has been overwhelmingly negative and short interest has been sticky for months . If any combination of oncology data seasonal vaccine stability or accelerated exUS approvals hits at the same time pessimism could unwind quickly . Not_predicting fireworks but the setup is there for a meaningful sentiment reversal if catalysts land . Curious what everyone thinks Which catalyst hits first Oncology readouts Seasonal vaccine clarity Faster exUS approvals"

      "selftext": "This may be dumb and too simple, but I can’t understand putting say $10k on a football game with a point spread you have to beat and risking 100% of that investment. Oftentimes to win less than 100% return. I can invest in an individual stock and set a stop loss at say 10% and only lose $1000, not $10,000. I’m mostly invested in index ETFs but sometimes invest in stocks (literally bought RKLB a couple weeks ago at $47 after hearing about it at a party lol) and always set a trailing stop loss of 10% or so. It’s like if I bet on the Seahawks and they went down 24-0 at halftime, it’s the equivalent of taking a 10% loss instead of losing it all. So don’t get why people bet on sports as it’s terrible odds. And there’s tons of people with gambling problems who have lost it all. Maybe it’s more fun people think they know more about football than stocks which is fair. And I acknowledge you can get extremely leveraged and put no risk mitigation strategies in stocks, but at least they’re there and easily implemented. I dunno, just a random thought before Xmas. Let me have all the reasons I’m wrong lol.",

Oftentimes to win less than 100 % return . I can invest in an individual stock and set a stop loss at say 10 % and only lose $ 1000 not_ $ 10000 . I ’ m mostly invested in index ETFs but sometimes invest in stocks literally bought RKLB a couple weeks ago at $ 47 after hearing about it at a party lol and always set a trailing stop loss of 10 % or so . It ’ s like if I bet on the Seahawks and they went down 240 at halftime it ’ s the equivalent of taking a 10 % loss instead of losing it all . So don ’ t get why people bet on sports as it ’ s terrible odds . And there ’ s tons of people with gambling problems who have lost it all . Maybe it ’ s more fun people think they know more about football than stocks which is fair . And I acknowledge you can get extremely leveraged and put no_risk mitigation strategies in stocks but at least they ’ re there and easily implemented . I dunno just a random thought before Xmas .

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching $UBER and believe the stock is significantly oversold due to excessive fear that autonomous vehicles will soon destroy the ride-hailing business. This mirrors the situation with $GOOG earlier this year, when panic over ChatGPT and generative AI led to a sharp sell-off on concerns that search market share would vanish overnight. In reality, Google integrated AI into its products, preserved its moat, and the stock recovered as the threat proved premature. A similar dynamic is at play with Uber. The prevailing narrative assumes robotaxis will scale rapidly and obsolete human drivers, collapsing Uber’s commission model. However, widespread autonomous adoption faces major regulatory, safety, and cost barriers, making meaningful disruption likely 5–10 years away. Uber’s powerful network effects remain intact in the meantime, and the company is proactively partnering with AV leaders like Waymo while positioning its app as the primary interface for both human and autonomous rides. A major risk for all rideshare companies is lack of customer loyalty. The vast majority of ride share users have multiple apps and will use the option that meets the right mix of affordability and convenience at that given moment. I see this as a major advantage to Uber since they are the most widespread and have the most robust infrastructure to be able to provide the most low cost and convenient option. I recently traveled to multiple countries in South America and Uber was everywhere and cheaper than all alternatives. Additional growth drivers include continued expansion in Uber Eats with improving margins, scaling advertising and freight segments, and sustained profitability progress. At current valuations, the growth runway appears attractive if AV timelines extend even modestly. I’m long $UBER and adding on dips. Open to counterpoints on AV adoption speed or other risks.",

      "selftext": "Both NVDA and AMD peaked on October 29th and have since pulled back: - NVDA: Down ~17% from $212 to ~$175 - AMD: Down ~21% from $267 to ~$211 Both are showing oversold signals. But they're very different bets. **The quick comparison:** | Metric | NVDA | AMD | |--------|------|-----| | Forward P/E | 25x | ~42x | | Gross Margin | 75% | 54% | | Data Center Revenue | $51B/quarter | $4.3B/quarter | | AI Market Share | 80-90% | ~10% | | YTD Return | +39% | +99% | | RSI | ~33 (oversold) | ~39 (approaching) | **The case for NVDA:** - Dominant position (80-90% market share) - CUDA moat - developers are locked in - Forward P/E of 25x is actually reasonable for 50%+ growth - Better margins = more pricing power - RSI in oversold territory **The case for AMD:** - OpenAI partnership validates their chips for enterprise AI - Faster revenue growth - If they capture even 20% market share, stock doubles - Already outperformed NVDA 2.5x this year **The concerns:** - NVDA: Customer concentration, China export limits, competition catching up - AMD: ~40x adjusted P/E (GAAP inflated by Xilinx amortization) requires flawless execution, CUDA switching costs are real, still 10x smaller in data center revenue **My take:** At current prices, NVDA looks like better risk/reward. You're paying 25x forward earnings for the dominant player during a technical pullback. AMD is a great company at a rich valuation. The OpenAI deal is huge, but ~40x adjusted P/E prices in a lot of optimism. I'd want a deeper pullback to $180-195 before getting aggressive. If holding both: 70/30 NVDA/AMD makes sense. What's your take - is AMD's growth worth the premium, or is NVDA the safer bet here?",

      "selftext": "The stock market is seeing a lot of chop in the more popular sectors like A.I. despite earnings beats. In a prediction market - you wouldnt make much by predicting an obvious beat, or an obviously profitable year. But you can make enough now to outpeform the sp500 or even investing in those companies directly. For example, the old school of thought was, if a company is profitable and its financials are clean, its stock would suredly rise. But this isnt how the stock market works anymore. Teslas balance sheet looked way worse than fords yet as fords stock price went down, tesla skyrocketed. Now the same is holding true for many other stocks as well, and this is all thanks to hedging and excess options activity, turning the market into a giant casino instead of an instrument of debt as was intended. Thus, the rise of prediction markets. Take blackberry for example, double earnings beat and the stock loses substantial value immediately due to over leveraging - no fault of the company or shareholders. Meanwhile, a bullish player in the prediction market walked away with an actual profit by betting the company would beat earnings. While one is a marginalized loss (the stock) and the other is total loss, the position sizing eliminates this discrepancy. A shareholder of blackberry loses 13% on a double beat - that 13% lost had the same profitibality as the entire investment in the prediction market 3-fold. Which brings me to my next point - diversification. Eventually someone will work out the math and create a firm based entirely on prediction markets using the same diversified/model based portfolios which exist in the stock market, betting on 100's of companies to be profitable or not YOY. This is going to be so toxic for the economy becouse it takes money out of the instrument of debt and puts it into a market where the only 2 winners are the broker and the contract holders compared to the stock market where the third winner is the company whos equity increases with higher participancy. Unfortunatley, with the amount of leveraging, insider trading, and nonsensical market moves happening in the stock market, a future of prediction market dominance is all but guaranteed.",

      "selftext_processed": "The stock market is seeing a lot of chop in the more popular sectors like A.I . despite earnings beats . In a prediction market you wouldnt make much by predicting an obvious beat or an obviously profitable year . But you can make enough now to outpeform the sp500 or even investing in those companies directly . For example the old school of thought was if a company is profitable and its financials are clean its stock would suredly rise . But this isnt how the stock market works anymore . Teslas balance sheet looked way worse than fords yet as fords stock price went down tesla skyrocketed . Now the same is holding true for many other stocks as well and this is all thanks to hedging and excess options activity turning the market into a giant casino instead of an instrument of debt as was intended . Thus the rise of prediction markets . Take blackberry for example double earnings beat and the stock loses substantial value immediately due to over leveraging no_fault of the company or shareholders . Meanwhile a bullish player in the prediction market walked away with an actual profit by betting the company would beat earnings . While one is a marginalized loss the stock and the other is total loss the position sizing eliminates this discrepancy . A shareholder of blackberry loses 13 % on a double beat that 13 % lost had the same profitibality as the entire investment in the prediction market 3fold . Which brings me to my next point diversification . Eventually someone will work out the math and create a firm based entirely on prediction markets using the same diversifiedmodel based portfolios which exist in the stock market betting on 100s of companies to be profitable or not_YOY . This is going to be so toxic for the economy becouse it takes money out of the instrument of debt and puts it into a market where the only 2 winners are the broker and the contract holders compared to the stock market where the third winner is the company whos equity increases with higher participancy . Unfortunatley with the amount of leveraging insider trading and nonsensical market moves happening in the stock market a future of prediction market dominance is all but guaranteed ."

      "selftext": "I wanted to try trading futures on Boeing (BA) and NVIDIA (NVDA) yesterday on Bitget. Boeing futures aren’t available there yet, but while digging deeper into BA, what stood out was how concerning the underlying credit picture looks compared to the equity narrative. Boeing’s total debt has reached roughly $53.3 billion, with a significant maturity wall approaching: about $4.3 billion due in 2025 and another $8 billion in 2026. Moody’s recently downgraded Boeing’s senior unsecured debt, citing concerns that free cash flow may fall short of covering these obligations, forcing the company to rely on refinancing or additional capital raising. [ In the bond market, several Boeing issues are starting to trade at levels more commonly associated with stressed periods. The 4.875% notes due May 2025 are yielding near levels last seen during past episodes of credit strain, while longer-dated bonds like the 5.805% 2050s have shown modest spread widening in recent trades. Boeing has secured a $3 billion credit facility to support liquidity, but this comes against the backdrop of long-term debt that has ballooned from under $10 billion a decade ago. While S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings currently maintain stable outlooks at BBB-, the lowest investment-grade tier, the scale of upcoming maturities raises questions about execution risk in a higher-for-longer rate environment. Leverage remains elevated, with funds from operations to debt projected around 20% next year, a level that leaves limited margin for error if deliveries slow or cash generation disappoints. *Edit:* S&P revised its outlook to stable in October, pointing to improving aircraft production. Moody’s downgrade, however, highlights a more cautious view on the timing and durability of Boeing’s cash flow recovery.",

      "selftext_processed": "I wanted to try trading futures on Boeing BA and NVIDIA NVDA yesterday on Bitget . Boeing futures aren ’ t available there yet but while digging deeper into BA what stood out was how concerning the underlying credit picture looks compared to the equity narrative . Boeing ’ s total debt has reached roughly $ 53.3 billion with a significant maturity wall approaching about $ 4.3 billion due in 2025 and another $ 8 billion in 2026 . Moody ’ s recently downgraded Boeing ’ s senior unsecured debt citing concerns that free cash flow may fall short of covering these obligations forcing the company to rely on refinancing or additional capital raising . In the bond market several Boeing issues are starting to trade at levels more commonly associated with stressed periods . The 4.875 % notes due May 2025 are yielding near levels last seen during past episodes of credit strain while longerdated bonds like the 5.805 % 2050s have shown modest spread widening in recent trades . Boeing has secured a $ 3 billion credit facility to support liquidity but this comes against the backdrop of longterm debt that has ballooned from under $ 10 billion a decade ago . While SP Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings currently maintain stable outlooks at BBB the lowest investmentgrade tier the scale of upcoming maturities raises questions about execution risk in a higherforlonger rate environment . Leverage remains elevated with funds from operations to debt projected around 20 % next year a level that leaves limited margin for error if deliveries slow or cash generation disappoints . Edit SP revised its outlook to stable in October pointing to improving aircraft production . Moody ’ s downgrade however highlights a more cautious view on the timing and durability of Boeing ’ s cash flow recovery ."

      "selftext": "**My basic non-AI write up** I've been looking at reducing tech exposure considering recent jitters and been sifting through stocks worth strong value propositions in infrastructure, finance and tech. Viagra stood out for me. Here is my rationale. Vistra stock is an energy play recently trading at a \\\\\\~20% discount from ATH, currently trading $160-170 from $219. Analyst targets range from Low (217) to High (256). Mean target $233 (implied 40% upside) Forward PE is quite reasonable. Trailing PE is v. high, with last quarter EPS miss due to non-operational accounting event. Year-on-Year increases in Revenue, Net Income, Net Profit Margin, annual EPS, EBITDA. ROC at 11%, above average, indicating successful reinvestment and growth prospects. Significant acquisitions this year: 7 natural gas plants, ongoing gas and solar build outs. Recently finalised 20-year contract/power supply agreement set to begin 2027. Amazon & Microsoft partnered solar build outs in progress. Lowering interest rates landscape acts as a tailwind to allow for cheaper debt and build out loan serviceability. Energy demand is set to increase in 2026 and onwards with increasing electrification (vehicular, technology, AI/data). Institutional investment is increasing AND recent, notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to \\\\\\~10,935,188 shares (buying an additional \\\\\\~2,074,364 shares, increasing portfolio holding by 23% at an approximated cost basis of $170-180 per share) in Q3 2025. Technical analysis shows solid support levels at $166, $160, big base at $150, based on Fibonacci retracements, and Bollinger bands. No foolproof sign of full bottom/floor, however recent bouncing off $160 line is confidence inspiring. \\--- Let's discuss folks! **Update:** **I did some digging when someone elsewhere mentioned Nancy Pelosi buying VST calls. Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14, 2025, with underlying cost basis approximately $166. There is a chance she sold out at the $200 peak. But there is no disclosure of those positions being sold (which require disclosure) = technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $166**",

      "selftext_processed": "My basic nonAI write up Ive been looking at reducing tech exposure considering recent jitters and been sifting through stocks worth strong value propositions in infrastructure finance and tech . Viagra stood out for me . Here is my rationale . Vistra stock is an energy play recently trading at a 20 % discount from ATH currently trading $ 160170 from $ 219 . Analyst targets range from Low 217 to High 256 . Mean target $ 233 implied 40 % upside Forward PE is quite reasonable . Trailing PE is v. high with last quarter EPS miss due to nonoperational accounting event . YearonYear increases in Revenue Net Income Net Profit Margin annual EPS EBITDA . ROC at 11 % above average indicating successful reinvestment and growth prospects . Significant acquisitions this year 7 natural gas plants ongoing gas and solar build outs . Recently finalised 20year contractpower supply agreement set to begin 2027 . Amazon Microsoft partnered solar build outs in progress . Lowering interest rates landscape acts as a tailwind to allow for cheaper debt and build out loan serviceability . Energy demand is set to increase in 2026 and onwards with increasing electrification vehicular technology AIdata . Institutional investment is increasing AND recent notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to 10935188 shares buying an additional 2074364 shares increasing portfolio holding by 23 % at an approximated cost basis of $ 170180 per share in Q3 2025 . Technical analysis shows solid support levels at $ 166 $ 160 big base at $ 150 based on Fibonacci retracements and Bollinger bands . No_foolproof sign of full bottomfloor however recent bouncing off $ 160 line is confidence inspiring . Lets discuss folks Update I did some digging when someone elsewhere mentioned Nancy Pelosi buying VST calls . Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $ 50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14 2025 with underlying cost basis approximately $ 166 . There is a chance she sold out at the $ 200 peak . But there is no_disclosure of those positions being sold which require disclosure technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $ 166"

      "selftext": "Need some advice. I’m more of a trader in how I treat my portfolio. I’m constantly looking to make moves with approx. 50% of the portfolio. The other 50% is is Amazon with a cost average of $211. A few days ago I bought some core weave (about 7% worth of portfolio). I’m already up over 20% on it, and I know that this stock is highly volatile. Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $40 and sold it all at like $43.. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn’t know a whole lot about their business. And then I watch it run all the way up to $185 and missed out on all of those potential gains. So my question is this, should I take the profits now with the 20%+ gain in only a few days? Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $100 and keeps running from there.. possibly retests the highs of $185. Full disclaimer, I did sell about 15% pf the shares near the highs today, so this question is for the reminding 85% which I still own. Thanks in advance.",

      "selftext_processed": "Need some advice . I ’ m more of a trader in how I treat my portfolio . I ’ m constantly looking to make moves with approx . 50 % of the portfolio . The other 50 % is is Amazon with a cost average of $ 211 . A few days ago I bought some core weave about 7 % worth of portfolio . I ’ m already up over 20 % on it and I know that this stock is highly volatile . Shortly after the ipo I bought at around $ 40 and sold it all at like $ 43 .. was happy to make a few bucks and at the time I didn ’ t know a whole lot about their business . And then I watch it run all the way up to $ 185 and missed out on all of those potential gains . So my question is this should I take the profits now with the 20 % gain in only a few days Or should I wait this one out in case it runs back up over $ 100 and keeps running from there .. possibly retests the highs of $ 185 . Full disclaimer I did sell about 15 % pf the shares near the highs today so this question is for the reminding 85 % which I still own . Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "Oracle’s CDS recently jumped to 153 basis points, and with that $108 billion debt and negative $18 billion cash flow, ORCL stock investors are freaking out. What if this isn’t just a misjudge of financial? Larry Ellison, America’s second richest person with a $393 billion net worth, isn’t the type to mess up on financing. With decades running Oracle and political connections he’s too smart for that. I feel like it’s a calculated move. It might tie into the Genesis program. Oracle’s got amazing tech, optimized GPUs and resilient RAC databases, making it a perfect fit to team up with OpenAI as the feds’ go to AI backbone. That CDS 153 basis point spike? Maybe it’s not distress; maybe it’s a signal for a bailout to lock in U.S. AI dominance over rivals like China. And comparing this to old CDS numbers may not make sense anymore. AI’s changed the game with all this debt funding, so past levels just may not be comparable. But who knows? Do you think Ellison’s working this behind closed doors with the government to turn market panic into a strategic win? Disclaimer: NFA. Yes, I hold ORCL.",

With decades running Oracle and political connections he ’ s too smart for that . I feel like it ’ s a calculated move . It might tie into the Genesis program . Oracle ’ s got amazing tech optimized GPUs and resilient RAC databases making it a perfect fit to team up with OpenAI as the feds ’ go to AI backbone . That CDS 153 basis point spike Maybe it ’ s not_distress maybe it ’ s a signal for a bailout to lock in U.S. AI dominance over rivals like China . And comparing this to old CDS numbers may not_make sense anymore . AI ’ s changed the game with all this debt funding so past levels just may not_be comparable .

      "selftext": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs, i.e. UPRO (3x leveraged S&P500). I’ve been investing for 3 years now. My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOO/VT. I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA, along with seemingly steady employment, and 50% savings rate/cash flow. Due to my young age and very long time horizon (20-40 years), I’m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young. I’m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio, perhaps around 5-15%. I’ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility drag/decay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run. Over this last year I’ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times: [Investing with Leverage (Borrowing to Invest, Leveraged ETFs)]( I’ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio. I’m well aware that we are in an “interesting” market to say the least. One that is very volatile and wouldn’t be surprising to experience a 10-15% correction within the next 2 years (which would be a 30-45% correction in 3x leverage). I’m completely comfortable with this and doesn’t intimidate my conviction in the market. With all that said, I’m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs - If you own shares in one, what has your experience been, would you recommend it? - Due to potential returns, is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage? - Is it asinine/very stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10+ years due to the volatility drag/decay? Or any other thoughts comments, thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "25M seeking perspectives on leveraged ETFs i.e . UPRO 3x leveraged SP500 . I ’ ve been investing for 3 years now . My strategy involves Dollar Cost Averaging into low cost broad ETFs like VOOVT . I have a strong rainy day fund of 1 year expenses in cash in HYSA along with seemingly steady employment and 50 % savings ratecash flow . Due to my young age and very long time horizon 2040 years I ’ m very comfortable taking slightly more risk in my portfolio while I am young . I ’ m interested in adding some leverage to my portfolio perhaps around 515 % . I ’ ve been reading about leveraged ETFs and I understand the risks as well as the downsides like volatility dragdecay experienced on volatile assets in leveraged ETFs over the long run . Over this last year I ’ ve probably watched this video by Ben Felix about 5 times Investing with Leverage Borrowing to Invest Leveraged ETFs I ’ ve also consulted LLMs as well as blogs from on this topic and it has really made me want to consider adding a slight amount of leverage to my portfolio . I ’ m well aware that we are in an “ interesting ” market to say the least . One that is very volatile and wouldn ’ t be surprising to experience a 1015 % correction within the next 2 years which would be a 3045 % correction in 3x leverage . I ’ m completely comfortable with this and doesn ’ t intimidate my conviction in the market . With all that said I ’ m curious to ask the community about their opinions on Leveraged ETFs If you own shares in one what has your experience been would you recommend it Due to potential returns is it better to add this position in a tax advantaged ROTH IRA vs a traditional brokerage Is it asininevery stupid to hold a leveraged ETF position for 10 years due to the volatility dragdecay Or any other thoughts comments thanks"

      "selftext": "Hi, I’m looking for some input on a small satellite allocation within an otherwise simple, long-term portfolio (core is a broad global ETF with ongoing DCA). My satellites currently include Google (GOOG), Nvidia (NVDA), and Broadcom (AVGO), but together they only make up a small % of my total portfolio. Given that limited size, I’m wondering: Does it make more sense to concentrate on 1–2 names instead of holding all three? For a 10–15 year horizon, which would you prioritize: Google (diversified cash machine + AI optionality), or Nvidia (AI leader, higher growth but more cyclicality/valuation risk)? Where does Broadcom fit for long-term conviction? This isn’t about short-term trading, just optimizing a long-term satellite sleeve while the core keeps compounding. Curious to hear your thoughts. Thanks EDIT: maybe I should add AMAZON....?",

      "selftext": "WILMINGTON, Delaware, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Delaware's Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package from Tesla, which was once valued at $56 billion. Two years ago, a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement, calling it “incredible.” The ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delaware's reputation as a business-friendly jurisdiction. This compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new, larger compensation plan in November. The ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018, when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the world's most valuable companies. The 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met. Tesla estimated the plan's potential value at $56 billion in 2018, but given the stock's surge, its value had soared to roughly $120 billion by early November. These options represent about 9% of Tesla's outstanding shares. Musk never exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan, the board was sued by Richard Tornetta, an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock. In 2024, after a five-day trial, Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan. She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded. Musk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Tesla's lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere. A handful of large companies like Dropbox, Roblox, The Trade Desk, and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas. Nevertheless, Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies. Tesla's board warned that Musk the world's richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesn't get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands. In November, shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles, a robotaxi network, and humanoid robot sales. Tesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan. The Austin-based company has now incorporated in Texas, enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3% of the company's shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law. Such a stake would be worth approximately $30 billion, and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares.",

      "selftext_processed": "WILMINGTON Delaware Dec 19 Reuters Delawares Supreme Court on Friday reinstated Elon Musks 2018 compensation package from Tesla which was once valued at $ 56 billion . Two years ago a lower court had struck down the compensation agreement calling it “ incredible. ” The ruling overturns a previous decision that had drawn fierce opposition from Musk and damaged Delawares reputation as a businessfriendly jurisdiction . This compensation package was the highest to date until Tesla shareholders approved a new larger compensation plan in November . The ruling means Musk can finally receive compensation for his work since 2018 when he transformed Tesla from a struggling startup into one of the worlds most valuable companies . The 2018 compensation agreement granted Musk options to purchase approximately 304 million Tesla shares at a deeply discounted price if the company achieved a series of milestone targets all of which Tesla ultimately met . Tesla estimated the plans potential value at $ 56 billion in 2018 but given the stocks surge its value had soared to roughly $ 120 billion by early November . These options represent about 9 % of Teslas outstanding shares . Musk never_exercised his stock options because shortly after shareholders approved the 2018 compensation plan the board was sued by Richard Tornetta an investor who held only 9 shares of Tesla stock . In 2024 after a fiveday trial Delaware Judge Catherine McCormick ruled that Tesla directors had conflicts of interest and concealed key facts when shareholders voted to approve the plan . She ordered the 2018 restructuring plan to be rescinded . Musk accused the Delaware judge of being a radical hostile to tech founders and urged companies to follow Teslas lead by relocating their corporate registrations elsewhere . A handful of large companies like Dropbox Roblox The Trade Desk and Coinbase have moved their legal registrations to Nevada or Texas . Nevertheless Delaware remains the most popular legal domicile for U.S. public companies . Teslas board warned that Musk the worlds richest man and leader of rocket company SpaceX and AI startup xAI could leave the electric vehicle company if he doesnt get the pay raise and increased voting rights he demands . In November shareholders approved a new compensation plan that could be worth up to $ 878 billion if Tesla achieves its goals for autonomous vehicles a robotaxi network and humanoid robot sales . Tesla has taken steps to reduce the risk that shareholders could legally block the 2025 plan . The Austinbased company has now incorporated in Texas enabling Tesla to require any investor or group of investors to hold 3 % of the companys shares before filing a lawsuit alleging violations of corporate law . Such a stake would be worth approximately $ 30 billion and Musk is the only individual holding that many shares ."

      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about Microsoft, Google, and Nvidia joining the government's \"Genesis Project.\" And yes, it's truly historic to see 24 giants, including Google, Amazon, and OpenAI, signing a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Energy (DOE). But if you only focus on these trillion-dollar giants, you're missing out on opportunities for tenfold returns. The White House has just fast-tracked an AI-driven science platform. We're talking about using AI to solve problems in nuclear fusion, grid modernization, and biotechnology at a speed never before seen by humanity. This isn't just a policy; it's a massive capital injection into AI infrastructure. The Overlooked Winners: While headlines focus on MSFT and NVDA, the real \"generational outperformance\" is hidden in the energy and infrastructure sectors. CRWV just jumped 19% after being added to the index, but there are two other specialized infrastructure stocks that are still trading at a significant discount because the market hasn't yet connected them to this initiative. The Intersection of Nuclear Energy and AI: The Genesis executive order explicitly mentions energy dominance. There's a specific microcap company that provides cooling technology to the Department of Energy's supercomputing labs involved in this mission. Core strategy: The market is currently only seeing this as positive news for large manufacturers, but the supply chain of the Genesis platform is where the real squeeze will occur in the first quarter of 2026. Over the past 48 hours, I cross-referenced the Department of Energy's supplier list with recent patent applications related to the U.S. scientific security platform. I have identified three stock tickers that are highly likely to be the primary beneficiaries of the first wave of federal contracts. WULF best fits the Trump administration's nuclear energy/AI logic, and VRT is the most solid supply chain stock If you're serious about AI/energy trades in 2026, I'd be happy to share this research and exchange ideas on where smart money is flowing before the anticipated surge in the first quarter.",

      "title": "Preferred Stock Trade for Potential 10-20% Return",
      "selftext": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on. It centers around Albemarle's mandatory convertible preferred stock ALB-A. This preferred stock pays a roughly 6% dividend, which is decent, but nothing crazy. Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar. '27. This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in. This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline. By my math, one could lock in a 10-20% return as long as ALB doesn't drop below $100 from its current $147. Here's how it works: 1. Buy 263 shares of ALB-A today for $16,100 2. Sell an ALB call option for Jan. '27 with a $100 strike price for $6,300 3. Collect $1,192 in ALB-A dividends between now and conversion 4. Reinvest the $6,300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $250 5. Either close out the positions in Jan. '27 or roll the call option to Mar. '27 after the conversion has happened 6. Conversion happens in Mar. 27 when you'll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here? If the share price is above $130, you'd make just under 10%. If the share price falls to $100, you'd make around 20%. The biggest risk is it falls to around $73 or below, at which point you'd start losing money. Ultimately no downside risk until ALB falls more than 50%, and potential returns of 10-20% as long as it doesn't fall more than 30%. Now, could it fall more than 50%? Absolutely. In fact it was around that range as recently as August, but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support. What else haven't I considered?",

      "selftext_processed": "I came across an interesting trade that I wanted to get thoughts on . It centers around Albemarles mandatory convertible preferred stock ALBA . This preferred stock pays a roughly 6 % dividend which is decent but nothing_crazy . Where it gets interesting is knowing that this preferred stock will convert to ALB in Mar . 27 . This preferred stock essentially has a mandatory put option built in . This presents an opportunity to sell an ALB call option on a similar timeline . By my math one could lock in a 1020 % return as long as ALB doesnt drop below $ 100 from its current $ 147 . Heres how it works 1 . Buy 263 shares of ALBA today for $ 16100 2 . Sell an ALB call option for Jan. 27 with a $ 100 strike price for $ 6300 3 . Collect $ 1192 in ALBA dividends between now and conversion 4 . Reinvest the $ 6300 in something safe like SGOV for an additional $ 250 5 . Either close out the positions in Jan. 27 or roll the call option to Mar . 27 after the conversion has happened 6 . Conversion happens in Mar . 27 when youll get between 100 and 120 shares roughly So what are the potential outcomes here If the share price is above $ 130 youd make just under 10 % . If the share price falls to $ 100 youd make around 20 % . The biggest risk is it falls to around $ 73 or below at which point youd start losing money . Ultimately no_downside risk until ALB falls more than 50 % and potential returns of 1020 % as long as it doesnt fall more than 30 % . Now could it fall more than 50 % Absolutely . In fact it was around that range as recently as August but I believe demand for lithium will provide price support . What else havent I considered"

      "title": "Is Cover Corp (5253) a smart long-term bet, or am I blinded by sentiment?",
      "selftext": "Hello, Sentiment investment Cover Corp (5253) started my journey with investing. Im looking for some opinions on this investment, and proposition of diversification. I read many mentions about buy and hold, so on 10 year horizon investing in cover corp does make sense to me. The company that as I see it: * Investing in infrastructure - cover invcests in Music Label, Trading card game, Holoearth * Holoearth- is a VR platform which aims to sell digital merchandise and concerts on their own platform and allows to reduce involvement of Youtube, or spwn etc for big profitable events * company owns big and modern 3d studio with motion tracking technologies, these are for concerts, but could probably be used for making games and cinematics * Management -the CEO (Yagoo, yoichi wada...) and other directors have history with companies like Sony, Sanrio, Square Enix, korean entertainment platforms and more proving experience and connections are there. * Historical growth: company saw massive growth durign covid, im not sure if that growth is sustainable, but it aligns with Japan as whole plans and goals for expansion of their entertainment overseas. Direct competition to cover is company Anycolor (5032), this company is much more profitable which leads to their shares being valued 3-4 times more. However they focus on immediate gains and shareholder returns with no comparable investments * Solving problems: 2025 Us shipping cost and tariffs hurt their income, if what i read is correct cover is moving toward a model where they send bulk shipments to the US rather than individual packages * missing prognoses- the company according to what I read and looked up on youtube analysis hasnt always meet their financial forecasts, because of their big investments. Is investing alot a weaknes or strenght in this industry? * Pricin: the company share is currently low * Competition: Japan as whole competes for Oversea market, Korea is likely big competitor with its animations being more and mroe popular, music, etc. Im also making this post to get suggestions and opinions on diversifications- I already opened small savings plans with Invesco MSCI World (A40G12), Vanguard FTSE All-World (A1JX52), and VanEck Rare Earths (A3CRL9) and was looking at defence, but not all shares that caught my eye are available in my app so this is my list im eyeing: 1. **Koei Tecmo (3635):** I like their stability, high cash reserves, and the fact that they are very disciplined (almost like a fund manager that also makes games). 2. **Defense Strategy:** I'm interested in the \"Poland-Korea\" defense axis. Since individual Korean shares aren't in my app, I'm looking at: * **iShares MSCI Korea UCITS ETF** * **Future of European Defence Screened UCITS ETF** * **iShares Global Aerospace & Defence UCITS ETF** Am i overvaluating Cover corp because of sentiment? Is Metaverse \"holoearth\" viable goal for entertainment industry for comapny that does multiple concerts each year? regarding defense- do you think these specialized incestments are already priced in by the market after governments put more gdp into military in eu now? or is it safe long term sector given the world situation? Thanks for advice. =)",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello Sentiment investment Cover Corp 5253 started my journey with investing . Im looking for some opinions on this investment and proposition of diversification . I read many mentions about buy and hold so on 10 year horizon investing in cover corp does make sense to me . The company that as I see it Investing in infrastructure cover invcests in Music Label Trading card game Holoearth Holoearth is a VR platform which aims to sell digital merchandise and concerts on their own platform and allows to reduce involvement of Youtube or spwn etc for big profitable events company owns big and modern 3d studio with motion tracking technologies these are for concerts but could probably be used for making games and cinematics Management the CEO Yagoo yoichi wada ... and other directors have history with companies like Sony Sanrio Square Enix korean entertainment platforms and more proving experience and connections are there . Historical growth company saw massive growth durign covid im not_sure if that growth is sustainable but it aligns with Japan as whole plans and goals for expansion of their entertainment overseas . Direct competition to cover is company Anycolor 5032 this company is much more profitable which leads to their shares being valued 34 times more . However they focus on immediate gains and shareholder returns with no_comparable investments Solving problems 2025 Us shipping cost and tariffs hurt their income if what i read is correct cover is moving toward a model where they send bulk shipments to the US rather than individual packages missing prognoses the company according to what I read and looked up on youtube analysis hasnt always meet their financial forecasts because of their big investments . Is investing alot a weaknes or strenght in this industry Pricin the company share is currently low Competition Japan as whole competes for Oversea market Korea is likely big competitor with its animations being more and mroe popular music etc . Im also making this post to get suggestions and opinions on diversifications I already opened small savings plans with Invesco MSCI World A40G12 Vanguard FTSE AllWorld A1JX52 and VanEck Rare Earths A3CRL9 and was looking at defence but not_all shares that caught my eye are available in my app so this is my list im eyeing 1 . Koei Tecmo 3635 I like their stability high cash reserves and the fact that they are very disciplined almost like a fund manager that also makes games . 2 . Defense Strategy Im interested in the PolandKorea defense axis . Since individual Korean shares arent in my app Im looking at iShares MSCI Korea UCITS ETF Future of European Defence Screened UCITS ETF iShares Global Aerospace Defence UCITS ETF Am i overvaluating Cover corp because of sentiment Is Metaverse holoearth viable goal for entertainment industry for comapny that does multiple concerts each year regarding defense do you think these specialized incestments are already priced in by the market after governments put more gdp into military in eu now or is it safe long term sector given the world situation Thanks for advice ."

      "selftext": "Just something I've been musing about. The purpose of stocks, to me understanding, is to support/fund a company in the hopes it does well and said stock becomes more valuable. However, as we all know, that's not how it works in practice. People can become millionaires by simply buying low and selling hi, all of a couple clicks of work. If you're rich enough or coordinated enough you can pump and dump like Gamestop. Doesn't seem fair, right? Not to mention how easy the system in to abuse. But if stocks could only be sold to the company you bought it from that would no longer be the case, right? I know this isn't something anyone here wants, but humor me plz. If congress passed a law saying stocks can only be purchased from the company and can only be sold back to the company, who are required to buy it back, would this create more issues than it would solve? Would it even work to for the purposes of investing in a companies future growth?",

The purpose of stocks to me understanding is to supportfund a company in the hopes it does well and said stock becomes more valuable . However as we all know thats not_how it works in practice . People can become millionaires by simply buying low and selling hi all of a couple clicks of work . If youre rich enough or coordinated enough you can pump and dump like Gamestop . Doesnt seem fair right Not_to mention how easy the system in to abuse . But if stocks could only be sold to the company you bought it from that would no_longer be the case right I know this isnt something anyone here wants but humor me plz . If congress passed a law saying stocks can only be purchased from the company and can only be sold back to the company who are required to buy it back would this create more issues than it would solve Would it even work to for the purposes of investing in a companies future growth"

Issue usually is that your stock needs to be part of an exchange fund in order to participate, so options here are limited. The thread about [\"enhanced direct indexing\"]( sparked my interest as well, but seems a little less straight forward since it seems to rely on taking a loan to buy a wide set of stocks via Direct Indexing, and then waiting for some of them to be \"losses\" that you can sell as you slowly unwind your loans and pull out of your concentrated position. Does anyone have other sources? [Fidelity's generic article]( seems to not really know of much beyond what we discussed already.",

While Tesla's fundamentals remain unchanged, I believe the easiest phase of its price appreciation has passed. Long-term themes like autonomous driving and robotics remain intact, but at current levels, the short-term risk/reward ratio feels less favorable. I won't chase the price at these levels. Either hold existing positions or wait for better entry points. How are you currently managing your Tesla holdings? Are you holding existing positions or waiting for a pullback?",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’m looking for some advice and guidance as I’m fairly new to investing outside of ETFs. Up until now, I’ve mainly stuck with ETFs because they feel simpler, more diversified, and easier to understand as a beginner. Lately though, I’ve been thinking about branching out into individual companies, but I’m finding the process a bit overwhelming. There seems to be a huge sea of options when it comes to stocks, across different industries, markets, and levels of risk. With so many companies to choose from, I’m curious how you all narrow things down and decide which ones are worth researching further. Do you start by looking at industries you’re already familiar with, or do you screen based on financial metrics like revenue growth, profitability, or valuation ratios? I’m also interested in learning what your research process looks like before you actually invest. For example, how much weight do you put on a company’s financial statements versus things like management quality, competitive advantages, or long-term growth potential? Are there specific tools, websites, or resources you rely on to help with analysis? Finally, I’d love to know how you manage risk when investing in individual stocks, especially compared to ETFs. Any tips, common mistakes to avoid, or lessons learned from your own experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance for any insights you’re willing to share.",

The Passive Bubble: We’ve seen record inflows into VOO and VTI this month. It’s reached a point where the \"buy the dip\" bot is the only one left trading. The Institutional Exit: While retail is high on \"Santa\" sentiment, look at the volume on the mega-caps like ORCL and tech giants. The smart money is quietly rotating into \"junk\" bonds and undervalued Real Estate. The January Cliff: Tax-loss harvesting ends in 10 days. The moment the calendar flips to 2026, the \"perfect\" charts we see now are going to hit a wall of sell orders that no AI can predict. The Question: Are we actually seeing a recovery, or is this just the world’s biggest liquidity trap before the Q1 reality check?",

Micron's massive profits capped off a stellar year for the chipmaker. Though its achievements were often overshadowed by giants like Nvidia and AMD, Micron's stock performance significantly outpaced both rivals in 2025. Year to date, Micron shares have surged nearly 200%, compared to Nvidia's 28% gain and AMD's 65% increase. What's your target price for MU?",

Its next move will be dictated by market forces alone. The Nasdaq opened higher yesterday and continued consolidating around 23,000, while Nasdaq futures posted two consecutive gains. The Christmas rally may be quietly approaching. * NVDA: Buy on dips, await bullish reversal. * MSFT: Trading within a range; consider going long only after it returns to 490. * AMZN: First stop-loss level at 220, second stop-loss level at 210. * AAPL: Look to 276. Only a break above 276 signals an upward trend. * GOOG: Faces resistance at 305. Look for a rebound near 310 to turn bullish; otherwise, remain bearish. * META: Wait for a pullback near 660 to confirm new support before going long. * TSLA: Facing strong resistance at 490, unable to boost valuation. Holders may consider liquidating positions to enjoy the holidays. Not a Musk supporter? Avoid chasing the price higher here.",

      "title": "The USD-JPY 140/170 Tail Risk: Why a Yen Carry Trade Unwind Will Fuel a Global Financial Meltdown",
      "selftext": "For thirty years, the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy: the Japanese Yen. It was the \"infinite money glitch,\" a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history. But yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not just raise rates; they shattered the glass floor. With the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield finally piercing the 2.02% threshold, the \"Great Liquidity Era\" has officially met its end. As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape, I need you to understand that we are not just looking at a currency fluctuation. We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade. If you are not watching the Yen, you are flying blind into a hurricane. # I. The Architecture of the Glitch: 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990, Japan has been a laboratory for \"Extraordinary Monetary Policy.\" To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation, the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). By pinning JGB yields near zero, the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth. This birthed the Yen Carry Trade: investors borrow JPY at near-zero rates, sell it for USD, and buy high-yielding US Treasuries or high-growth Nasdaq tech. This was not just a trade; it was a systemic short-volatility bet. As long as Japan stayed \"frozen,\" the world had a \"BOJ Put.\" However, that era of artificial stability created a massive build-up of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge. # II. The Mathematics of the Shock: Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates. In the halls of institutional finance, **we care about Velocity ($dy/dt$**). The absolute yield matters for long-term solvency, but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival. The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return ($E\\_r$): **Expected Return = Leverage \\* \\[ (Asset Yield - Japanese Funding Rate) + Currency Drift - Volatility Premium \\]** **Variable Breakdown** * **Leverage (L):** This is your Multiplier. Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash. They are typically levered 3x to 10x. This variable acts as a force multiplier, magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or, increasingly, for worse. * **Asset Yield:** Your Target Return. This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen, typically the US 10-Year Treasury yield or the S&P 500 earnings yield. * **Japanese Funding Rate:** Your Cost of Carry. This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen. As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5%, this cost eats directly into your profit margin, narrowing the \"spread.\" * **Currency Drift:** The Exchange Rate Delta. This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen. If the Yen appreciates, you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency. Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains. * **Volatility/Fear Premium:** The Risk Tax. This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added risk-premium required to hold the trade. When markets get jittery, this value spikes, often making the trade mathematically unviable for risk-managed funds before they even lose money on the interest rates. When JGB yields \"gap\" higher in a matter of days, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) models of every major bank go \"code red.\" This triggers an explosion in the $\\\\sigma\\_{fx}$ variable, causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse. The trade does not just stop; it unwinds. A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans, creating the Feedback Loop of Doom. # III. The Bridge to 2.5%: From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a \"Volatility Shock,\" which is a violent, short-term liquidation, a breach of the 2.5% JGB level represents something far more dangerous: a Passive Structural Breach. If USD/JPY reaches 170, the BOJ’s hand is forced. The cost of imported energy creates an \"Inflationary Breach\" that threatens social stability. To defend the currency, the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5%. Once yields pass 2.5%, the carry trade does not \"crash\" due to panic. Instead, it evaporates due to math. At 2.5%, the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero. Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a risk-free return in their own currency, creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets cannot replace. # IV. The Mechanics of the Unwind: The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds, it does not happen in a vacuum. It triggers a mechanical, cross-asset contagion. This is the \"Gravity\" phase of the cycle. 1. **The Treasury Sell-Off (The Initial Trigger):** As Japanese yields approach the 2.5% \"Death Zone,\" Japanese banks and insurers stop buying. To shore up domestic balance sheets, they begin selling their US holdings. This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit. * **The Result:** US 10-year yields spike toward 5.5% or 6.0%. 2. **The Equity Market Margin Call:** Most of the \"borrowed\" Yen is parked in high-beta growth stocks and crypto. As US Treasury yields spike, the discount rate for these equities rises, causing their valuations to compress. * **The Feedback Loop:** Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders. To pay back their JPY loans, they must sell more stocks. This selling forces them to buy back Yen, which makes the Yen stronger, making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back. 3. **The Liquidity Vacuum:** Because the Fed and BOJ are \"boxed in,\" there is no buyer of last resort. Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable. In this phase, the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0, and everything sells off at once. # V. The Boxed-In Reality: The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence. For decades, the US Federal Reserve acted as the world's ultimate Volatility Suppressor. Whenever the system shook, the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable. But today, the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction (MAD) framework. The BOJ is boxed in by the Yen's survival. If they do not raise rates, the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyper-inflation. If they do raise rates, they trigger a global margin call. The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall. With US inflation remaining sticky, the Fed has lost its dampening powers. They can no longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation. The \"Volatility Suppressor\" has been unplugged. # VI. Conclusion: The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct, catastrophic outcomes, but they both terminate at the same point: the liquidation of global leverage. 1. **The 140 Tail (Deflationary Spiral):** A sudden, violent surge in the Yen to 140. This is the \"fast-death\" scenario, which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world’s equities to pay back JPY loans. 2. **The 170 Tail (The Inflationary Breach):** This is the most likely path. As the Yen bleeds out to 170, the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5% to stop the hemorrhage. This causes the Passive Breach, which is the \"slow-death\" scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets, causing a relentless sell-off in Treasuries and equities. The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable. For the first time in the modern era, the Fed cannot print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency. Across the entire vector of assets, including equities, crypto, and private credit, the VaR is exploding. Volatility is no longer being dampened; it is being amplified. **The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent.** The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo. The detonator has been triggered, the fuse is burning, and 170 is the point of no return.",

      "selftext_processed": "For thirty years the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy the Japanese Yen . It was the infinite money glitch a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history . But yesterday the Bank of Japan BOJ did not_just raise rates they shattered the glass floor . With the 10year Japanese Government Bond JGB yield finally piercing the 2.02 % threshold the Great Liquidity Era has officially met its end . As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape I need you to understand that we are not_just looking at a currency fluctuation . We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade . If you are not_watching the Yen you are flying blind into a hurricane . I . The Architecture of the Glitch 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990 Japan has been a laboratory for Extraordinary Monetary Policy . To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing QE and Yield Curve Control YCC . By pinning JGB yields near zero the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth . This birthed the Yen Carry Trade investors borrow JPY at nearzero rates sell it for USD and buy highyielding US Treasuries or highgrowth Nasdaq tech . This was not_just a trade it was a systemic shortvolatility bet . As long as Japan stayed frozen the world had a BOJ Put . However that era of artificial stability created a massive buildup of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge . II . The Mathematics of the Shock Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates . In the halls of institutional finance we care about Velocity $ dydt $ . The absolute yield matters for longterm solvency but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival . The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return $ E_r $ Expected Return Leverage Asset Yield Japanese Funding Rate Currency Drift Volatility Premium Variable Breakdown Leverage L This is your Multiplier . Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash . They are typically levered 3x to 10x . This variable acts as a force multiplier magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or increasingly for worse . Asset Yield Your Target Return . This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen typically the US 10Year Treasury yield or the SP 500 earnings yield . Japanese Funding Rate Your Cost of Carry . This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen . As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5 % this cost eats directly into your profit margin narrowing the spread . Currency Drift The Exchange Rate Delta . This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen . If the Yen appreciates you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency . Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains . VolatilityFear Premium The Risk Tax . This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added riskpremium required to hold the trade . When markets get jittery this value spikes often making the trade mathematically unviable for riskmanaged funds before they even lose money on the interest rates . When JGB yields gap higher in a matter of days the ValueatRisk VaR models of every major bank go code red . This triggers an explosion in the $ sigma_fx $ variable causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse . The trade does not_just stop it unwinds . A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans creating the Feedback Loop of Doom . III . The Bridge to 2.5 % From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a Volatility Shock which is a violent shortterm liquidation a breach of the 2.5 % JGB level represents something far more dangerous a Passive Structural Breach . If USDJPY reaches 170 the BOJ ’ s hand is forced . The cost of imported energy creates an Inflationary Breach that threatens social stability . To defend the currency the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5 % . Once yields pass 2.5 % the carry trade does not_crash due to panic . Instead it evaporates due to math . At 2.5 % the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero . Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a riskfree return in their own currency creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets can not replace . IV . The Mechanics of the Unwind The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds it does not_happen in a vacuum . It triggers a mechanical crossasset contagion . This is the Gravity phase of the cycle . 1 . The Treasury SellOff The Initial Trigger As Japanese yields approach the 2.5 % Death Zone Japanese banks and insurers stop buying . To shore up domestic balance sheets they begin selling their US holdings . This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit . The Result US 10year yields spike toward 5.5 % or 6.0 % . 2 . The Equity Market Margin Call Most of the borrowed Yen is parked in highbeta growth stocks and crypto . As US Treasury yields spike the discount rate for these equities rises causing their valuations to compress . The Feedback Loop Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders . To pay back their JPY loans they must sell more stocks . This selling forces them to buy back Yen which makes the Yen stronger making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back . 3 . The Liquidity Vacuum Because the Fed and BOJ are boxed in there is no_buyer of last resort . Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable . In this phase the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0 and everything sells off at once . V. The BoxedIn Reality The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence . For decades the US Federal Reserve acted as the worlds ultimate Volatility Suppressor . Whenever the system shook the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable . But today the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction MAD framework . The BOJ is boxed in by the Yens survival . If they do not_raise rates the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyperinflation . If they do raise rates they trigger a global margin call . The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall . With US inflation remaining sticky the Fed has lost its dampening powers . They can no_longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation . The Volatility Suppressor has been unplugged . VI . Conclusion The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct catastrophic outcomes but they both terminate at the same point the liquidation of global leverage . 1 . The 140 Tail Deflationary Spiral A sudden violent surge in the Yen to 140 . This is the fastdeath scenario which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world ’ s equities to pay back JPY loans . 2 . The 170 Tail The Inflationary Breach This is the most likely path . As the Yen bleeds out to 170 the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5 % to stop the hemorrhage . This causes the Passive Breach which is the slowdeath scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets causing a relentless selloff in Treasuries and equities . The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable . For the first time in the modern era the Fed can not print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency . Across the entire vector of assets including equities crypto and private credit the VaR is exploding . Volatility is no_longer being dampened it is being amplified . The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent . The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo . The detonator has been triggered the fuse is burning and 170 is the point of no_return ."

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic .

      "selftext": "I have a few shares of AMD, but the recent dip in Broadcom seems attractive. But both have relatively high P/E ratios. Broadcom’s debt is far larger than AMD's. AMD's goal is to gain market share from Nvidia. But Google's TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD. Therefore, I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future. Considering those facts, would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMD's shares?",

AMDs goal is to gain market share from Nvidia . But Googles TPU performance shows that big techs can rely on their own custom chips rather than buying from Nvidia or AMD . Therefore I am guessing big techs will use more and more of their own custom chips in future . Considering those facts would it be a good idea to buy Broadcom by selling all of AMDs shares"

      "selftext": "I’m a market analyst, and I wanted to share how I currently think about silver not as a trade idea, but as a portfolio component in the current macro environment. From my perspective, silver’s strength this year reflects more than just speculative interest. Several structural factors are converging: 1) Macro backdrop: Falling interest rates and rising fiscal deficits have renewed interest in real assets as stores of value. 2) Investment demand: Both institutional and retail flows into silver ETFs have accelerated, suggesting broader participation rather than isolated speculation. 3) Industrial demand: Silver is increasingly tied to long-term trends such as solar energy, electric vehicles, and data centres areas with secular growth. 4) Supply dynamics: Physical market tightness, particularly in London, has limited available supply, with constraints expected to persist. What makes silver interesting to me is its dual nature part monetary metal, part industrial input. That combination gives it a different risk-return profile than gold or purely cyclical commodities. This isn’t a recommendation to buy or sell just my analytical framework.",

      "selftext": "# edit: This post was deleted by reddit's \"bad url\" filter (gay) **TLDR: Dell caught with it's pants down, RAM drought too painful. Dell fuk.** **Who tf is Gom\\_KBull and Why should I listen?** Back in April when SOXL was trading at 8-11 range, I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was [screenshot ]( June and [screenshot ]( July I've sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November, ending in a 3 bagger... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bull-run. Back in November 10, i've put out a [warning ]( shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over. This is about all I have as far as credibility (so far). # # The RAM Shortage Preface *Alot of this section is basic knowledge, you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage.* In case you've been living under a rock, the price of RAM has been going parabolic. This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators. So the RAM farmers said \"oh shit, fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM\" **There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth: Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron.** **DRAM supply ⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️** But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is: **DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️, DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️** [Exhibit A]( [Exhibit]( B What does this mean? EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed, especially areas that are NOT directly exposed to AI profitability. Everything tech related NEEDS memory, but as long as you're not using HBMs you're going to the second-priority lane. Among the roadkill in this RAM storm, the juiciest looks like Dell. # What is Dell's profitability and exposure looking in this quarter? DELL's revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025. One part is ISG (Infrastructure Solutions Group). This side is from providing AI-related solutions, focusing on infrastructure (hello datacenters). The other half is CSG, everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop, or hardware... this is CSG side. Dell's CSG side of the business is completely fucked (at least for 2026). *Why?* Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating. Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage ( i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit, but they are front page if you google \"Lenovo Hoarding\"), other PC and smartphone companies (MSFT/AAPL and the like) have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply. Not to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game... MUCH more than DELL is. *Does Dell have this security or anything similar?* **NOPE.** Up until 2025, Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength. Now in late 2025 to all of 2026... its their **Achilles' tendon**. The COO (Jeff Clark) of Dell stated >*“We’re in a very unique time. It’s unprecedented. We have not seen costs move at the rate that we’ve seen. And by the way, it’s not unique to DRAM, it’s NAND. It is hard drives, leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network,” he told analysts. “I’d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply, and as we wade our way through that, we’re going to lean on the things that we’ve always done.”* **This is corporate speak for** >*\"Oh shit oh shit oh shit. This wasn't supposed to happen. Oh god, we're so fuk\"* And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 10-30% to offset their costs. Here's the problem... ***WHO IS PAYING 20%+ more for Dell products?*** Think about it... would corporates (or even individuals) bite their tongue and pay >20% premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs? They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees, they are not in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCs/laptops. There will be customers (both corporate and individual) who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 2-3 years until prices stabilize (hopefully)... and that's IF they don't just look elsewhere. And personally, I believe Dell won't stop at a 30% increase. If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are, Dell will have no choice but to go farther beyond this. But what else CAN they do? They don't have a strategy or countermeasure. This is the last resort when you're supply chain fucks you. As for the ISG side, I admit Dell's operating margins are improving quarter over quarter... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling. In the big picture, their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability. Its not very profitable for them right now, but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in. # But what if this is already priced in? It is to a small extent I'll admit, my thesis still holds that Wall street does not fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February. **Add onto that, because we don't foresee RAM shortage letting up in 2026-2027, but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance.** # How do the Insiders feel? **According to Quiver Quant:** >Dell Technologies insiders have traded $DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months. Of those trades, **0 have been purchases** and **464 have been sales**. Here’s a breakdown of [recent trading of $DELL stock]( by insiders over the last 6 months: * [MICHAEL S DELL]( (Chief Executive Officer) has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16,253,968 shares for an estimated **$2,222,753,260**. * IV (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * V (GP), L.L.C. SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6,315,957 shares for an estimated **$864,817,529**. * [WILLIAM D GREEN]( has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272,736 shares for an estimated **$39,695,260**. * [ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN]( sold 79,806 shares for an estimated **$12,255,009** * [WILLIAM F SCANNELL]( (Pres., Glob. Sales & Cust. Ops) sold 91,230 shares for an estimated **$10,803,456** * [EGON DURBAN]( sold 71,000 shares for an estimated **$9,806,520 . . .** # External Considerations * **The fed already booted up QE** * *The fed started reserve management purchases (soft QE?) but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills. Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates, I don't see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way.* * **AI unwind** * This does not rely on the \"AI Bubble\" or \"AI sentiment souring.\" If AI is dying through the market, this will just be added headwind for Dell. * **What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter?** * Its already happening, and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain... moreso than others in its sector (likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones) * RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play. **Positions:** 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17, 2026 75 Put *And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February* *Since Dell's earnings is in February and Micron's earnings will be in March, i might flip my winnings(if any) between the 2 dates.*",

      "selftext_processed": "edit This post was deleted by reddits bad url filter gay TLDR Dell caught with its pants down RAM drought too painful . Dell fuk . Who tf is Gom_KBull and Why should I listen Back in April when SOXL was trading at 811 range I took out a loan and loaded up every single LEAP i could This was screenshot June and screenshot July Ive sold off all the LEAPs on these in early November ending in a 3 bagger ... although most of us profited big over that 6 month bullrun . Back in November 10 ive put out a warning shit didnt feel right anymore and the bull run was likely over . This is about all I have as far as credibility so far . The RAM Shortage Preface Alot of this section is basic knowledge you can skip if this you are already aware of the RAM shortage . In case youve been living under a rock the price of RAM has been going parabolic . This is because AI hyperscalers are offering b00k00 bucks to memory producers for their AI slop generators . So the RAM farmers said oh shit fuck DRAM lets make and sell a metric assload of HBM There are ONLY 3 major memory producers on planet earth Samsung SK Hynix Micron . DRAM supply ⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️ But the reality now and going forward into 2026 is DRAM supply ⬇️⬇️⬇️ DRAM price ⬆️⬆️⬆️ Exhibit A Exhibit B What does this mean EVERYTHING in tech is getting squeezed especially areas that are NOT_directly exposed to AI profitability . Everything tech related NEEDS memory but as long as youre not_using HBMs youre going to the secondpriority lane . Among the roadkill in this RAM storm the juiciest looks like Dell . What is Dells profitability and exposure looking in this quarter DELLs revenue stream essentially comes half and half for 2025 . One part is ISG Infrastructure Solutions Group . This side is from providing AIrelated solutions focusing on infrastructure hello datacenters . The other half is CSG everytime you see a shiddy DELL laptop or hardware ... this is CSG side . Dells CSG side of the business is completely fucked at least for 2026 . Why Because Dell is paying 4x for RAM and the cost is only accelerating . Lenovo is hoarding RAM to mitigate this damage i tried to link evidence but it got flagged by reddit but they are front page if you google Lenovo Hoarding other PC and smartphone companies MSFTAAPL and the like have long term contracts to LOCK IN prices for their supply . Not_to mention MSFT and AAPL are already heavily in the AI game ... MUCH more than DELL is . Does Dell have this security or anything similar NOPE . Up until 2025 Dell has been known to have short term supply arrangements as its key strength . Now in late 2025 to all of 2026 ... its their Achilles tendon . The COO Jeff Clark of Dell stated “ We ’ re in a very unique time . It ’ s unprecedented . We have not_seen costs move at the rate that we ’ ve seen . And by the way it ’ s not_unique to DRAM it ’ s NAND . It is hard drives leading edge nodes across the semiconductor network ” he told analysts . “ I ’ d categorize it as demand is way ahead of supply and as we wade our way through that we ’ re going to lean on the things that we ’ ve always done. ” This is corporate speak for Oh shit oh shit oh shit . This wasnt supposed to happen . Oh god were so fuk And Dell has also noted it plans to raise the prices of their products by 1030 % to offset their costs . Heres the problem ... WHO IS PAYING 20 % more for Dell products Think about it ... would corporates or even individuals bite their tongue and pay 20 % premium for shiddy Dell laptops and PCs They have already laid off tens of thousands of employees they are not_in a position to easily fork over cash at a premium for bulk PCslaptops . There will be customers both corporate and individual who are more than willing to just let their existing hardware tough it out for 23 years until prices stabilize hopefully ... and thats IF they dont just look elsewhere . And personally I believe Dell wont stop at a 30 % increase . If these RAM prices continue to rise as they are Dell will have no_choice but to go farther beyond this . But what else CAN they do They dont have a strategy or countermeasure . This is the last resort when youre supply chain fucks you . As for the ISG side I admit Dells operating margins are improving quarter over quarter ... but this wont do much to outshine the pain CSG side is feeling . In the big picture their ISG side has a very very small margin for profitability . Its not_very profitable for them right now but they HAVE TO do it to stay relevant in the AI heavy economic environment we are in . But what if this is already priced in It is to a small extent Ill admit my thesis still holds that Wall street does not_fully foresee the horror show that will unfold when DELL releases their numbers in February . Add onto that because we dont foresee RAM shortage letting up in 20262027 but instead being just as bad or worse for future quarters ... They will have to mention that in upcoming guidance . How do the Insiders feel According to Quiver Quant Dell Technologies insiders have traded $ DELL stock on the open market 464 times in the past 6 months . Of those trades 0 have been purchases and 464 have been sales . Here ’ s a breakdown of recent trading of $ DELL stock by insiders over the last 6 months MICHAEL S DELL Chief Executive Officer has made 0 purchases and 2 sales selling 16253968 shares for an estimated $ 2222753260 . IV GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . V GP L.L.C . SLTA has made 0 purchases and 221 sales selling 6315957 shares for an estimated $ 864817529 . WILLIAM D GREEN has made 0 purchases and 6 sales selling 272736 shares for an estimated $ 39695260 . ELLEN JAMISON KULLMAN sold 79806 shares for an estimated $ 12255009 WILLIAM F SCANNELL Pres . Glob . Sales Cust . Ops sold 91230 shares for an estimated $ 10803456 EGON DURBAN sold 71000 shares for an estimated $ 9806520 . . . External Considerations The fed already booted up QE The fed started reserve management purchases soft QE but its at a much smaller rate than before and only to short dated treasury bills . Beyond providing some health for smallcaps and unfucking the bond yield rates I dont see this affecting my play for Dell in any meaningful way . AI unwind This does not_rely on the AI Bubble or AI sentiment souring . If AI is dying through the market this will just be added headwind for Dell . What if the RAM Shortage Ends too soon to matter Its already happening and Dell is ALREADY feeling the pain ... moreso than others in its sector likely HPQ is going through the same but it doesnt seem to be have much meat left on the bones RAM production facilities are being built but will take years to start being operational to matter for this play . Positions 20x DELL Mar 20 2026 90 Put 80x DELL APR 17 2026 75 Put And I will be accumulating more as we get closer to their earnings in February Since Dells earnings is in February and Microns earnings will be in March i might flip my winningsif any between the 2 dates ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors >In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026. >“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote. >The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. >After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon. >ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner. >Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake >The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm. >Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.",

Today’s Executive Order (Dec 18, 2025) to move the sector to Schedule III changes that by removing IRS Section 280E. Under 280E, these companies were taxed on gross revenue because they couldn't deduct rent or payroll. This led to effective tax rates of 70-90%. By moving to a standard 21% corporate rate, the \"top tier\" of the $MSOS ETF will see profits increase exponentially. Furthermore, recent federal legislation just effectively banned 95% of hemp-derived THC competition (gas station Delta-8/9). The legal, regulated companies are getting their competition outlawed and their taxes slashed in the same month. **Disclosure:** I am long $MSOS and related U.S. operators.",

      "selftext": "Trump Media & Technology Group surged a staggering 40% today, with the intraday rally clearly not the work of “normal capital.” Honestly, seeing this move, my first thought wasn't fundamentals it was whether that blond guy was back in the game personally “stoking the fire.” A single word from him can instantly make the stock price defy gravity. The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels? I'm a bit conflicted myself: On one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic; On the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.” So I'd love to hear your thoughts Do you see any worthwhile opportunities here? Is this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

      "selftext": "I saw a piece of news about NVDA today and honestly, this kind of story is something only long-term shareholders would stop and think twice about. It’s not earnings. It’s not a price target. And it’s not even some kind of “explosive catalyst.” It was just this one line: NVDA will work with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to integrate an exploration platform connecting government, industry, and academia. If you’ve only been following NVDA for the past year, you’d probably think: “What does this have to do with the stock price?” But if you’ve held NVDA long enough, you know what really defines a company often isn’t in the headline. What is the DOE? It’s not there to fuel market hype. It oversees supercomputing, energy systems, materials science, nuclear research. When places like this choose a platform, they have a few traits: Slow Deliberate Once they adopt it, they rarely switch This isn’t just “selling GPUs” anymore. This is being woven into the foundational computing infrastructure of U.S. research and industry. Lately, I’ve seen way too much discussion about NVDA: “Isn’t the valuation too high?” “Is this a bubble?” “Should I trim my position?” Honestly, I’ve been through this before. 2017, 2020, 2023… people have said this every cycle. But when you look back, what has really held NVDA up isn’t sentiment, but the fact that “the world can’t do without it anymore.” Now it’s not just indispensable among cloud providers it’s becoming the default choice in government, research, and energy systems too. This isn’t the kind of news that makes the stock jump 10% tomorrow. This is the kind of news where: Five years from now, you’ll look back and realize the groundwork was already being laid today. Not saying you should buy. Not saying it won’t pull back. But as a long-term shareholder, one thing is becoming clearer to me: When a company starts getting embedded into national level systems, arguing about whether it’s “expensive” using ordinary tech stock logic… well, that feels like we’re not even on the same wavelength anymore. Just curious: How many people here have held NVDA for more than 3 years? What’s your first reaction when you see news like this?",

      "selftext": "I have some super underwater covered calls and was thinking about what's the best way to get out of them. I'm not sure if I just thought of something useful or if there's flaws. Here's my example: I bought ABC stock for $10 forever ago. I sold covered calls super early at a $20 strike and just keep rolling them, but there's really not much value in rolling anymore because the stock is on a mega run and is now $200. If I donate the underlying to charity, I get to write off $200 (which avoids $190 in capital gains). At the same time, I can take that $20 covered (naked now after donating the underlying) call and close it for a huge loss. Would this effectively allow me to almost get like a double deduction out of it? I get away from having to pay capital gains which is almost the full amount given the run up, and then now I also get to claim a huge loss on the call? Is there anything wrong with this strategy other than I am not getting any money out of it - but that's okay I'm willing to donate to charity. This seems to be much more tax efficient for me than just donating directly... someone help me either validate this or tell me what's wrong with the plan. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "Many folks have made a fortune with Bitcoin, NVDA, PLTR etc. Those who have the ability to see with some clarity as to what will happen to these risky assets are very fortunate. People like me heavily rely on youtubers and reddit content to get a sense of how things are going for any of these risky assets, and what are the potential risks. BTC falling by 80% has happened quite a few times in the past. Stocks like AMZN have also fell like that in the past. At least, with stocks, you know that valuation is high so the potential downside is very high. But with Bitcoin, we don't even know what can trigger a massive selloff other than the well known speculations like MSTR dying etc. Following are the only few ways to manage risks. 1. Buying leaps. They will be extremely expensive for risky assets. So part of the unrealized gain will be lost in protecting the asset which is a bit ironic :) 2. Sell covered calls. Some of these stocks are well known to skyrocket within a short period of time. With covered calls, all the major upside will be lost if the stock really takes off like never before. A bunch of idiots on Youtube kept yelling \"overvalued ... overvalued\" when NVDA was at $400 presplit. I sold all my 100 shares fearing that it will crash like Cisco did around the year 2000. I bet the covered call sellers would also have regretted that move quite a bit. 3. Simply exit the position, or at least take some profit and continue with reduced risk. Sadly, a good chunk of upside will be lost if it indeed manages to go up in the \"long run.\" :) Stocks like GOOGL are relatively less risky but BTC, PLTR etc are like landmines. They can explode anytime when lady luck steps on it, and it is making me very nervous day by day. We cannot have the cake and eat it too. Something's gotta give. Nevertheless I wanted to pick your brain as to how you manage your risk if you are hedging your portfolio in some way. Would really appreciate it if you can share some ideas.",

      "selftext_processed": "Many folks have made a fortune with Bitcoin NVDA PLTR etc . Those who have the ability to see with some clarity as to what will happen to these risky assets are very fortunate . People like me heavily rely on youtubers and reddit content to get a sense of how things are going for any of these risky assets and what are the potential risks . BTC falling by 80 % has happened quite a few times in the past . Stocks like AMZN have also fell like that in the past . At least with stocks you know that valuation is high so the potential downside is very high . But with Bitcoin we dont even know what can trigger a massive selloff other than the well known speculations like MSTR dying etc . Following are the only few ways to manage risks . 1 . Buying leaps . They will be extremely expensive for risky assets . So part of the unrealized gain will be lost in protecting the asset which is a bit ironic 2 . Sell covered calls . Some of these stocks are well known to skyrocket within a short period of time . With covered calls all the major upside will be lost if the stock really takes off like never_before . A bunch of idiots on Youtube kept yelling overvalued ... overvalued when NVDA was at $ 400 presplit . I sold all my 100 shares fearing that it will crash like Cisco did around the year 2000 . I bet the covered call sellers would also have regretted that move quite a bit . 3 . Simply exit the position or at least take some profit and continue with reduced risk . Sadly a good chunk of upside will be lost if it indeed manages to go up in the long run . Stocks like GOOGL are relatively less risky but BTC PLTR etc are like landmines . They can explode anytime when lady luck steps on it and it is making me very nervous day by day . We can not have the cake and eat it too . Somethings got ta give . Nevertheless I wanted to pick your brain as to how you manage your risk if you are hedging your portfolio in some way . Would really appreciate it if you can share some ideas ."

      "selftext": "TSMC is reportedly set to begin mass production of its 2nm process by the end of this year. Capacity at its two existing fabs has been fully booked, prompting the company to build additional facilities. It plans to invest $28.6 billion to meet demand. Major clients include Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and AMD, with Apple securing over half of the initial capacity. TSMC aims to increase monthly production to 100,000 wafers by the end of 2026. Morgan Stanley has also raised its target price, noting growth potential in revenue and margins for 2026, with gross margins projected to exceed 60%. Positives: Tight capacity and premium pricing for advanced nodes positively impact near-term revenue and pricing power; major clients queuing up confirms genuine demand. Risks: $28.6 billion in massive CapEx, extended delivery cycles, and long capital payback periods; significant risks if end-demand slows or inventory builds. Should one increase TSMC holdings now or wait for early 2026 order data?",

      "selftext": "Convenience is one of the few business models that stays powerful in any market. If you remove friction from a routine chore, usage tends to follow. That is the simplest way to understand the EzFill angle under NXXT. Per the EzFill website, the service brings fuel to your vehicle and is built around an app workflow: schedule in minutes, location pins, same day delivery options, and notifications when the job is done. What caught my eye is the stacking. It is not just fuel. The app also shows EZWash, which is basically the same idea applied to vehicle care. More convenience layers can mean more reasons for customers to stay inside one ecosystem rather than shop around each time. EzFill also states 4.8/5 app rating, 1M+ professional deliveries, and 10M+ gallons sold to date on its website. Those are execution claims worth verifying, but they frame this as a working operating business, not a concept pitch. If this is the entry point, the bigger question is whether convenience can drive repeat usage cheaply enough to support durable growth. Do your own research. Not financial advice.",

      "selftext": "Not trying to push a bull or bear narrative here just sharing how TSLA looks to me right now from a market + technical perspective. Price wise, TSLA is still holding near highs, but the structure feels very different compared to earlier runs. A few things that stand out: Clear overhead resistance Every push toward recent highs keeps getting sold into. Doesn’t feel like retail panic selling more like larger players trimming or hedging into strength. Strong looking support below (for now) There’s a pretty obvious high volume area underneath where buyers have stepped in multiple times. As long as that holds, this still looks more like high level consolidation than a full trend break. Volume isn’t convincing on bounces The rebounds lately feel more news driven than demand driven. Not seeing that clean, aggressive accumulation you’d want if this was about to rip higher. Because of that, this spot feels kind of uncomfortable for both sides: Chasing here feels late Shorting blindly feels risky as long as support holds Personally, I’m leaning light position / wait and see rather than pressing either direction. If it breaks down, it’ll probably be obvious. If it breaks out, I’d rather see confirmation than front-run it. Longer term, yeah everything still comes back to Robotaxi / FSD / AI narrative vs regulatory and execution risk. But short term, the tape feels like it’s asking a question, not giving an answer. So I’m genuinely curious: Do you see this as high level base building before another leg up? Or distribution after a big run? Or is TSLA basically a pure headline stock now where technicals don’t even matter? If you’re holding TSLA, how are you positioned right now adding, holding, trimming, or just watching? Interested to hear how people with different time horizons are thinking about this.",

Price wise TSLA is still holding near highs but the structure feels very different compared to earlier runs . A few things that stand out Clear overhead resistance Every push toward recent highs keeps getting sold into . Doesn ’ t feel like retail panic selling more like larger players trimming or hedging into strength . Strong looking support below for now There ’ s a pretty obvious high volume area underneath where buyers have stepped in multiple times . As long as that holds this still looks more like high level consolidation than a full trend break . Volume isn ’ t convincing on bounces The rebounds lately feel more news driven than demand driven . Not_seeing that clean aggressive accumulation you ’ d want if this was about to rip higher . Because of that this spot feels kind of uncomfortable for both sides Chasing here feels late Shorting blindly feels risky as long as support holds Personally I ’ m leaning light position wait and see rather than pressing either direction . If it breaks down it ’ ll probably be obvious . If it breaks out I ’ d rather see confirmation than frontrun it . Longer term yeah everything still comes back to Robotaxi FSD AI narrative vs regulatory and execution risk . But short term the tape feels like it ’ s asking a question not_giving an answer . So I ’ m genuinely curious Do you see this as high level base building before another leg up Or distribution after a big run Or is TSLA basically a pure headline stock now where technicals don ’ t even matter If you ’ re holding TSLA how are you positioned right now adding holding trimming or just watching Interested to hear how people with different time horizons are thinking about this ."

      "title": "Why I’m still bullish on Tesla despite the noise",
      "selftext": "Tesla has become one of the most controversial stocks on the market, but looking beyond the daily headlines, I still believe it possesses a strong long term growth trajectory. Admittedly, the automotive business faces pressures intense pricing competition, saturation in the Chinese market, and profit margins that are no longer what they once were. Yet the market often overemphasizes the vehicle segment while underestimating the new direction Tesla is pivoting toward. FSD capabilities are advancing slowly but substantially. While the timeline remains contentious, Tesla's data advantage is difficult to replicate. Even if autonomous driving achieves only incremental breakthroughs, its implied option value is significant. The Optimus project, though at an earlier stage, represents asymmetric upside potential not a factor already fully priced in by the market. Collectively, the value and potential embedded in these two technologies are limitless. I don't expect the stock price to rise in a straight line, and pullbacks along the way would be unsurprising. But when examining Tesla over a multi year cycle, I am currently more bullish than bearish especially compared to numerous AI concept stocks that have already priced in perfect expectations. Curious to hear your perspective on TSLA, Do you primarily view it as a traditional automaker, or as a platform with option value?",

      "selftext": "I came across a news article that said CPI unexpectedly cooled in November. Is a weakening labor market the main culprit? The Consumer Price Index(CPI)rose2.7%annually in November,below estimates at 3.1%. Investors cheered the news as it could encourage the Fed to lower rates. Retailers are seeing consumers trade down to cheaper products. What does it mean for investors? Going into 2026,investors seem to be hoping for a Goldilocks economy,one where the economy isn’t so weak that it leads to a recession,but isn’t strong enough to keep inflation elevated. Ideally,for the stock market,inflation would continue to cool off,which would help the average consumer and could persuade the Fed to cut rates.

This is why many risk-on assets have been hit pretty hard - or so that's the narrative I'm hearing off X and other places on Reddit. What if this is only the first rate hike? Everyone says the market has now priced in a 75 bps rate hike - this would get Japan's yield to 1.25%. However, this is well below the US overnight fed rate of 3.5 to 3.75%. What would happen to the US stock market and other assets if Japan were to implement a series of 25 to 75 bps rate hikes over the next 2-3 years, bringing their interest rates to 3.5% to match what the current perceived \"neutral\" rate is?",

      "selftext": "Reports indicate Google is advancing TorchTPU to enable PyTorch to run natively on TPUs, with Meta also providing support. The core significance is singular: reducing the cost of migration from NVDA and CUDA. In the short term, CUDA remains the de facto standard, and NVDA's position is difficult to shake. But this marks the first time we've seen a major player attempt to challenge it at the software ecosystem level, rather than just developing proprietary chips. For investors, which interpretation do you favor? Is this a potential crack in NVDA's long term moat? Or is it merely a bargaining tool for GOOGL and META to drive down prices and diversify supply chains? Would this lead you to adjust your long term positions in NVDA, GOOGL, or META?",

The core significance is singular reducing the cost of migration from NVDA and CUDA . In the short term CUDA remains the de facto standard and NVDAs position is difficult to shake . But this marks the first time weve seen a major player attempt to challenge it at the software ecosystem level rather than just developing proprietary chips . For investors which interpretation do you favor Is this a potential crack in NVDAs long term moat Or is it merely a bargaining tool for GOOGL and META to drive down prices and diversify supply chains Would this lead you to adjust your long term positions in NVDA GOOGL or META"

Recent inflation data has given tech stocks some breathing room, while Micron Technology’s strong earnings report added fuel to the rebound. Still, concerns remain about China’s aggressive push into AI infrastructure and semiconductors, which could challenge Nvidia’s long term positioning. * **Market Rebound**: The Nasdaq has bounced back thanks to favorable inflation numbers, creating a more positive environment for Nvidia and other tech names. * **Micron’s Impact**: Micron jumped 9.3% after earnings, which could help boost confidence across the sector, including Nvidia. * **China’s AI Push**: Heavy investment from China in AI and chip technology is a looming risk that Nvidia can’t ignore.

      "selftext": "I’m 18, UK based. Just took control of a £50k+ portfolio I built from savings and side hustles (flipping golf clubs, designer stuff, bit of luck). It’s been with the same firm my parents use. They’re about wealth preservation, not growth. Best year I got \\~16% while the S&P 500 did \\~25%. Fees are 1% + 0.5% platform. I don’t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me, which feels off. My aim is long term: save hard, compound, hit my financial goal at 45. With steady contributions and \\~7.5% returns after fees, it’s doable. Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive. Options: * 80% S&P 500 / 20% Nasdaq (higher growth, higher risk) * 70% S&P 500 / 30% global index + a few stocks (more diversified, less tech heavy) I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out. So: * Is all‑in S&P realistic for a UK investor long term? * Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify? * Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds? Not after hype, just grounded experiences. Cheers.",

      "selftext": "The latest Reuters report shows markets climbing as inflation data finally comes in \"cool,\" with Micron leading a massive tech rally. But looking past the green tickers, there’s a very human story here: 1 - The Pivot to Relief: For weeks, the sentiment was dominated by fear of a recession and high interest rates. Now, one \"good\" data point has the algorithms and the bulls acting like the path is perfectly clear again. 2 - The Micron Factor: Micron’s surge is being treated as the \"all clear\" for the tech sector. It’s fascinating how we pin our entire outlook for the global economy on the earnings of one semiconductor company. 3 - The \"Imperfect\" Truth: Inflation is easing, but the cost of living for actual humans is still at an all-time high. There is a widening gap between the \"perfect\" stock market gains and the \"imperfect\" reality of the average person’s wallet. The Human Question: Does this rally feel like a genuine recovery to you, or are we just caught in a cycle of reacting to the \"least bad\" news? Is anyone else nervous that we’re getting too comfortable with these sudden swings? Source -",

But looking past the green tickers there ’ s a very human story here 1 The Pivot to Relief For weeks the sentiment was dominated by fear of a recession and high interest rates . Now one good data point has the algorithms and the bulls acting like the path is perfectly clear again . 2 The Micron Factor Micron ’ s surge is being treated as the all clear for the tech sector . It ’ s fascinating how we pin our entire outlook for the global economy on the earnings of one semiconductor company . 3 The Imperfect Truth Inflation is easing but the cost of living for actual humans is still at an alltime high . There is a widening gap between the perfect stock market gains and the imperfect reality of the average person ’ s wallet . The Human Question Does this rally feel like a genuine recovery to you or are we just caught in a cycle of reacting to the least bad news Is anyone else nervous that we ’ re getting too comfortable with these sudden swings Source"

      "selftext": "Etsy has just announced a new $750 million share repurchase program, in addition to the \\~$200 million still available from the previous program. In total, the company now has close to $1 billion in potential buyback capacity over the coming quarters. The stock is becoming increasingly interesting, and I would have even liked to see it added in the future to Bitget’s tokenized stocks list with TSLA, QQQ, NVIDA for easier access. Here’s a breakdown of what this implies: # 1. What is a share repurchase? A company buys back its own shares on the market. This reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can mechanically improve EPS and support the stock price, even if operating results remain stable. # 2. Positive points highlighted by Etsy The outgoing CEO, Josh Silverman, states that he sees “significant value” in the stock and expresses confidence in the growth strategy led by the future CEO, Kruti Patel Goyal (who will take office on January 1, 2026). Etsy had around $1.6 billion in cash at the end of the last quarter, allowing these buybacks without sacrificing strategic investments (Etsy + Depop). The program is flexible, with no expiration date, and can be adjusted or stopped at any time. # 3. Risks and limitations Buybacks do not create intrinsic value if growth slows down (competitive pressure from Amazon, Shein, Temu, etc.). The stock has already shown strong volatility, with a significant correction after the post-COVID peak. The cash used for buybacks could also be allocated to acquisitions, R&D, or balance sheet strengthening, even though Etsy does not carry significant debt. Personally i thin It feels like the market is still partially underestimating Etsy: the platform maintains a strong niche (handmade, vintage), Depop targets Gen Z, and the new leadership seems ready to accelerate growth initiatives. A buyback program of this scale, potentially 15–20% of the current market cap, suggests that the board views the stock as undervalued. For now, the market reaction remains modest (+2.2% in premarket). Do you see Etsy as an undervalued long-term opportunity or more as a value trap? Are you tracking the stock or already positioned?

      "selftext": "Been refining my DCF process and wanted to share thoughts on terminal value assumptions because I think most retail investors get this part completely wrong. Using perpetual growth rates that are too optimistic obviously inflates intrinsic value calculations. For something like Dollar General right now with margin compression and Walmart competition, I'm using 1.5% terminal growth even though consensus would say 2.5%. Stock looks interesting around $85 but my DCF keeps spitting out fair value closer to $78 with realistic margin assumptions. Running models through valuesense has been helpful for sanity checking inputs against historical data. A 50 basis point difference in WACC completely changes whether something screens as undervalued or not. For retailers specifically, digging into same store sales trends before assuming growth normalization is essential. Companies that look cheapest on P/E often have the most questionable growth assumptions baked in.",

Using perpetual growth rates that are too optimistic obviously inflates intrinsic value calculations . For something like Dollar General right now with margin compression and Walmart competition Im using 1.5 % terminal growth even though consensus would say 2.5 % . Stock looks interesting around $ 85 but my DCF keeps spitting out fair value closer to $ 78 with realistic margin assumptions . Running models through valuesense has been helpful for sanity checking inputs against historical data . A 50 basis point difference in WACC completely changes whether something screens as undervalued or not_For retailers specifically digging into same store sales trends before assuming growth normalization is essential . Companies that look cheapest on PE often have the most questionable growth assumptions baked in ."

      "selftext": "You’ve all heard about the usual dangers of holding Bitcoin: losing your private keys, an exchange getting hacked, a 51% attack, a hard drive failure. Some even worry about extreme scenarios, like a massive solar storm wiping out digital infrastructure. But the real danger of holding Bitcoin is something far more fundamental. It isn’t technical, accidental, or catastrophic. It lies in the fact that what you are holding is a mirage, a ghost, a collective illusion. Bitcoin is presented as a financial instrument. It is described as money you hold in a digital wallet, a balance shown on a screen, and marketed as an alternative to banks. We all know Bitcoin is not tangible like gold or any other physical asset. When you buy Bitcoin, you receive no mass, no volume, nothing you can physically use. What you receive is a number: a balance. And if that balance truly represents something valuable, something revolutionary, something worth the enormous amount of electricity required to maintain the system, then it must allow you to extract something real. After all, at current prices, you must pay around $90,000 for that balance to increase by one. Yet the reality is that you can extract literally nothing from it. What is being sold is a mirage. Why? When you examine any traditional financial balance, you find that it represents someone else’s liability. For a balance to be legitimate, there must be an individual or institution that has taken on a liability. What the balance actually records is that liability. Without liability, a meaningful financial balance cannot exist, because it is precisely from this liability that balance holders extract value. When a liability is fulfilled, the holder receives real economic benefits. Let’s look at some concrete examples. The balance in a stock broker’s account represents the company’s liability. When the company distributes profits, conducts a share buyback, or liquidates its operations, it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance. The balance in a commodity broker’s account represents the liability of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder. That liability involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value, depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract. The balance in a bank account represents the bank’s liability toward the balance holder and, at the same time, the liability of the bank’s debtor toward the bank. This balance arises when a bank (commercial or central) approves a loan to an individual, company, or state. Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor, services, and goods. Because they are obligated to repay the loan, they must ultimately return goods, labor, and services to the balance holders, while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance. If the loan is not repaid, the bank seizes the debtor’s real estate, equipment, or vehicles and sells them at auction to balance holders. Thus, through the fulfillment of underlying liability, bank balance holders realize tangible benefits: goods, labor, services, tax relief, and physical assets. Bitcoin stands in stark contrast. In Bitcoin, there is no liability at all. There is no issuer, no debtor, and no institution that owes anything to the holder. The system consists of a protocol that assigns computational tasks, consumes energy, and, if those tasks are completed, records a number under an identifier in a distributed database. Users control cryptographic keys that allow them to move numbers between identifiers. And that is literally it. No claim is created. No liability is recorded. No future delivery of goods, services, or assets is required. The system appears as a financial balance, but it is merely a mechanism for reassigning numbers between identifiers. No holder can extract any economic benefit from it. All those sky-high prices, all the hype, all the discussion are built on an illusion. All promotion of Bitcoin as an “inflation hedge,” “scarce,” or “valuable” is a category error. Inflation arises from excessive or diluted liabilities. Since Bitcoin has no underlying liability, it cannot hedge against excessive or diluted liabilities. Scarcity refers to a limited amount of a resource, such as mass, volume, or a liability, not a rule about the maximum sum of numbers in a system. Value results from evaluating that resource. Paying for, or agreeing to, have a number assigned is not evaluation. It is simply paying a price. All promotion of Bitcoin serves a single purpose. It aims to attract the public to give up actual financial balances, balances that deliver tangible value, in exchange for numbers that deliver nothing. It is obvious why this is dangerous. Illusions, mirages, and hype, by their very nature, cannot last forever. Sooner or later, reality asserts itself. A system built on collective belief rather than liabilities, claims, or tangible value is destined to fail. When that collapse comes, all the resources poured into maintaining it, the electricity, the infrastructure, the opportunity cost of real assets surrendered, become sunk costs with no return. Holders who traded real financial claims will find there is simply nothing to extract. The danger is not theoretical; it is baked into the Bitcoin itself.",

      "selftext_processed": "You ’ ve all heard about the usual dangers of holding Bitcoin losing your private keys an exchange getting hacked a 51 % attack a hard drive failure . Some even worry about extreme scenarios like a massive solar storm wiping out digital infrastructure . But the real danger of holding Bitcoin is something far more fundamental . It isn ’ t technical accidental or catastrophic . It lies in the fact that what you are holding is a mirage a ghost a collective illusion . Bitcoin is presented as a financial instrument . It is described as money you hold in a digital wallet a balance shown on a screen and marketed as an alternative to banks . We all know Bitcoin is not_tangible like gold or any other physical asset . When you buy Bitcoin you receive no_mass no_volume nothing_you can physically use . What you receive is a number a balance . And if that balance truly represents something valuable something revolutionary something worth the enormous amount of electricity required to maintain the system then it must allow you to extract something real . After all at current prices you must pay around $ 90000 for that balance to increase by one . Yet the reality is that you can extract literally nothing_from it . What is being sold is a mirage . Why When you examine any traditional financial balance you find that it represents someone else ’ s liability . For a balance to be legitimate there must be an individual or institution that has taken on a liability . What the balance actually records is that liability . Without liability a meaningful financial balance can not exist because it is precisely from this liability that balance holders extract value . When a liability is fulfilled the holder receives real economic benefits . Let ’ s look at some concrete examples . The balance in a stock broker ’ s account represents the company ’ s liability . When the company distributes profits conducts a share buyback or liquidates its operations it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance . The balance in a commodity broker ’ s account represents the liability of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder . That liability involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract . The balance in a bank account represents the bank ’ s liability toward the balance holder and at the same time the liability of the bank ’ s debtor toward the bank . This balance arises when a bank commercial or central approves a loan to an individual company or state . Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor services and goods . Because they are obligated to repay the loan they must ultimately return goods labor and services to the balance holders while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance . If the loan is not_repaid the bank seizes the debtor ’ s real estate equipment or vehicles and sells them at auction to balance holders . Thus through the fulfillment of underlying liability bank balance holders realize tangible benefits goods labor services tax relief and physical assets . Bitcoin stands in stark contrast . In Bitcoin there is no_liability at all . There is no_issuer no_debtor and no_institution that owes anything to the holder . The system consists of a protocol that assigns computational tasks consumes energy and if those tasks are completed records a number under an identifier in a distributed database . Users control cryptographic keys that allow them to move numbers between identifiers . And that is literally it . No_claim is created . No_liability is recorded . No_future delivery of goods services or assets is required . The system appears as a financial balance but it is merely a mechanism for reassigning numbers between identifiers . No_holder can extract any economic benefit from it . All those skyhigh prices all the hype all the discussion are built on an illusion . All promotion of Bitcoin as an “ inflation hedge ” “ scarce ” or “ valuable ” is a category error . Inflation arises from excessive or diluted liabilities . Since Bitcoin has no_underlying liability it can not hedge against excessive or diluted liabilities . Scarcity refers to a limited amount of a resource such as mass volume or a liability not_a rule about the maximum sum of numbers in a system . Value results from evaluating that resource . Paying for or agreeing to have a number assigned is not_evaluation . It is simply paying a price . All promotion of Bitcoin serves a single purpose . It aims to attract the public to give up actual financial balances balances that deliver tangible value in exchange for numbers that deliver nothing_It is obvious why this is dangerous . Illusions mirages and hype by their very nature can not last forever . Sooner or later reality asserts itself . A system built on collective belief rather than liabilities claims or tangible value is destined to fail . When that collapse comes all the resources poured into maintaining it the electricity the infrastructure the opportunity cost of real assets surrendered become sunk costs with no_return . Holders who traded real financial claims will find there is simply nothing_to extract . The danger is not_theoretical it is baked into the Bitcoin itself ."

      "title": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale",
      "selftext": "Nvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

      "selftext": "Heavy post ahead!! There are some signs that we could be near the peak. My worries are growing -today was a huge warning, right after Friday, and we still have not yet seen a serious drop be priced in. Meaning, it's not unlikely the small haha down days may be just that - small.. They differ from the \"little bad news\" issues like Israel which quickly closed up, almost too fast. And that pattern became consistent after each episode. Up until now, it's been the same :sometimes seeing it on the daily progress, but don't be too greedy as the market has been prone to V bounce type rallies over and over again... We had been in that sort of \"market regeme\" for a while that may be shifting. Examining the market daily structure indicates a strong possibility, at least higher than average, of a lower high after a main high (see my attached nadsaq chart) we do not know if a massive tail sits below us, but if there is, it could pay heavily asymmetrically. Meaning like $10,000 may protect you from half a million in downside risk or more. But we don't need to nail each day. This is the opposite feel of how the market behaved post iran Israel, where we had no \"\" regime change \" so we overall could conclude the tape kept grinding higher in general. This chart was so similar to post covid and post tariffs and now, but it's like we could be at another inflection point. Much higher than the market believes. 1) debt default protection costs are rising , data centers being delayed. Capex is huge without a clear cut plan. Oracle literally may go bankrupt because if this. Banking risks and credit risks and products are directly exposed to Ai. The next wave of Ai will be MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE and require a Lot more hardware Than prior levels. I think a good analogy here with the circular deals are to fiber and communications in dot com bubble. The problem now, is if things go awry, we have the potential mix of a financial crisis aspect and Ai together. 2) this is arbitrary but I argue valid. Bitcoin surpassed 100k,is now well below thst (kind of like max pain for holders) while just now, some wealth advisors got the green light to sell it. That's a bit silly, as it's 1/10 its price when it really started catching On (let's say that's $10k) the technicals are poor, and when btc falls it pulls down risk assets. Aswath damordan discussed this on cnbc, but said he does own five of the seven mag 7 stocks. 3) ceos sounding extremely defensive. Recent interviews with Lisa su and Sam Altman really hit me as off. I respect Lisa greatly, but her tone was so defensive on a Bloomberg interview. 4) market technicals leading up to now. You can see this on the daily charts, as well as futures overnight. Sometimes, we're getting some insanely rapid, down moves. Sometimes very fast down moves at open as well. You yewterday Tues ended with a massive rally into the close thet kind of quickly... Fell apart like a bear market rally. I know there is also a key interest rate decision by the BOJ, which could throw a lot into the mix which few are actually reacting to PRIOR to the event when the tape still doesn't feel off. I'm feeling no reaction in the vix or tape yet and this leads me to one conclusion. Humans, as a species are extremely reactive, not extremely proactive. Think tsunami in Asia, earthquake sensors, we've known from history they've had huge quakes every hundred - 300 yesrs, and the last one being in the early - mid 1800s and we know this from history records. Meaning that if I genuinelly feel there's something off (sometimes I have, sometimes I briefly thought so but hadn't yet been able to confirm) like during the beginning of covid, this eerie feeling in the air - the market hadn't yet priced in the covid risks. I've been wrong so many times, but if bet equally each time it would've been net profitable :this has the exact same vibes I had prior to covid when David tepper was on the air saying he believes markets hadn't priced in this risk at all and himself was begging on a vix expansion two months after the virus. That would've been extremely profitable - tail risks.. Now Dr Burry has joined up on x too, if you want to look for his posts too.",

      "selftext_processed": "Heavy post ahead There are some signs that we could be near the peak . My worries are growing today was a huge warning right after Friday and we still have not_yet seen a serious drop be priced in . Meaning its not_unlikely the small haha down days may be just that small .. They differ from the little bad news issues like Israel which quickly closed up almost too fast . And that pattern became consistent after each episode . Up until now its been the same sometimes seeing it on the daily progress but dont be too greedy as the market has been prone to V bounce type rallies over and over again ... We had been in that sort of market regeme for a while that may be shifting . Examining the market daily structure indicates a strong possibility at least higher than average of a lower high after a main high see my attached nadsaq chart we do not_know if a massive tail sits below us but if there is it could pay heavily asymmetrically . Meaning like $ 10000 may protect you from half a million in downside risk or more . But we dont need to nail each day . This is the opposite feel of how the market behaved post iran Israel where we had no_ regime change so we overall could conclude the tape kept grinding higher in general . This chart was so similar to post covid and post tariffs and now but its like we could be at another inflection point . Much higher than the market believes . 1 debt default protection costs are rising data centers being delayed . Capex is huge without a clear cut plan . Oracle literally may go bankrupt because if this . Banking risks and credit risks and products are directly exposed to Ai . The next wave of Ai will be MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE and require a Lot more hardware Than prior levels . I think a good analogy here with the circular deals are to fiber and communications in dot com bubble . The problem now is if things go awry we have the potential mix of a financial crisis aspect and Ai together . 2 this is arbitrary but I argue valid . Bitcoin surpassed 100kis now well below thst kind of like max pain for holders while just now some wealth advisors got the green light to sell it . Thats a bit silly as its 110 its price when it really started catching On lets say thats $ 10k the technicals are poor and when btc falls it pulls down risk assets . Aswath damordan discussed this on cnbc but said he does own five of the seven mag 7 stocks . 3 ceos sounding extremely defensive . Recent interviews with Lisa su and Sam Altman really hit me as off . I respect Lisa greatly but her tone was so defensive on a Bloomberg interview . 4 market technicals leading up to now . You can see this on the daily charts as well as futures overnight . Sometimes were getting some insanely rapid down moves . Sometimes very fast down moves at open as well . You yewterday Tues ended with a massive rally into the close thet kind of quickly ... Fell apart like a bear market rally . I know there is also a key interest rate decision by the BOJ which could throw a lot into the mix which few are actually reacting to PRIOR to the event when the tape still doesnt feel off . Im feeling no_reaction in the vix or tape yet and this leads me to one conclusion . Humans as a species are extremely reactive not_extremely proactive . Think tsunami in Asia earthquake sensors weve known from history theyve had huge quakes every hundred 300 yesrs and the last one being in the early mid 1800s and we know this from history records . Meaning that if I genuinelly feel theres something off sometimes I have sometimes I briefly thought so but hadnt yet been able to confirm like during the beginning of covid this eerie feeling in the air the market hadnt yet priced in the covid risks . Ive been wrong so many times but if bet equally each time it wouldve been net profitable this has the exact same vibes I had prior to covid when David tepper was on the air saying he believes markets hadnt priced in this risk at all and himself was begging on a vix expansion two months after the virus . That wouldve been extremely profitable tail risks .. Now Dr Burry has joined up on x too if you want to look for his posts too ."

      "selftext": "I'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble. Anyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash. 1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time. 2. The S&P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed. 3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down. 4. The trailing P/E of the S&P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year. I'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down. Sources: [ [",

      "selftext_processed": "Im not_going to lie Im a little uneasy about this market . PE ratio is high . Unemployment rate is rising . Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4 . High beta stocks have gotten demolished . Buffets cash pile is at an ATH . Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify . The SP has returned over 20 % two years in a row followed by 15 % so far in 25 . Theres concerns over Oracles debt OpenAI making commitments they cant keep circular deals many people even believe were in a full on bubble . Anyway I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash . 1 . There have only been four years since 1938 where the SP 500 total return was 18 % or worse . 1974 2002 2008 and 2022 . So 487 years . Yes 18 % is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18 % . But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year you only lost 18 % or more over the next 12 months 4.6 % of the time . 2 . The SP 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995 . It was above 1.6 in 2016 . Above 1.5 in 2004 . And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s . It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed . 3 . The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times . Some notable stretches . 20092017 . 19911999 . 19821989 . 19471952 . So just because weve had three years of strong gains doesnt mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down . 4 . The trailing PE of the SP 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates . Namely Nvidia which has a 42x trailing PE but a 22.5x forward PE . Historically the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 34 % per year . Im not_saying there arent good reasons to be bearish . Im not_saying that 2026 is going to be a great year . Im not_even saying that you shouldnt reduce risk or that going to cash wont be the right move in hindsight . Im just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have . Earnings growth has been strong AI could really improve GDP over the next 510 years margins have been steadily increasing for a long time and interest rates are coming down . Sources"

If I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation.

Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed. Curious to hear from others.

      "title": "POET: The Photonic Solution to the SSD & RAM Shortage",
      "selftext": "We're all fully aware of what's going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD. [Kingston]( sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246% since early 2025 and says RAM/SSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down. [SK Hynix]( is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028, even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory. NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out, with double-digit price hikes locked in. On top of this, hyperscalers are only getting about [70% of the server DRAM they order]( even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50% in a single quarter. Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr. Evil prebooking [40% of the world's DRAM]( wafers with money that has yet to be seen. I say all this to say, HBM/DRAM/flash has become the new oil for AI, and everyone is fighting over the same barrels. What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn’t just how much memory you can buy, it’s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have, and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs, DRAM pools, and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce. In light of the RAM/SSD shortage, this has become a conversation about **finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands** This is where POET’s photonic engines come in: they don’t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD, but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway, letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBM/DRAM/flash. **So POET has two main products:** [The Optical Interposer]( \\- think of this as an “optical motherboard tile/chiplet.” [Starlight]( \\- an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light. Today’s optics usually look like this: * You’ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “gold box.” * Inside that box: lasers, modulators, drivers, receivers, lenses, fiber alignment, etc. * Every module is handheld, robot aligned, and tuned. Slow, expensive, power-hungry. POET’s interposer basically says fuck the gold box * They take silicon and III-V lasers and build everything into a flat wafer-scale platform. * Instead of doing micron-level alignment one module at a time, they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pick-and-place tools. * Fibers line up passively, so there's really no heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved * The parts on the interposer are configureable, so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer. think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it. To visualize, the interposer sits between the hot compute chips (GPUs/ASICs/NPUs) and the outside world (network, memory pools, storage) and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths. **Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer.** * Instead of putting hot, fragile lasers on the GPU/package, they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module. * That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute. **The benefits are:** * Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters (GB200, H100, etc.). * One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers. * Better reliability, easier maintenance, and lower $/bit because you share the light source across multiple links. **So together these two components work like this:** Starlight = shared light source Interposer = cheap, configurable, mass-produced optical engine tile that is easily scalable. This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product, as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer **So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution?** Most of the big incumbents (Broadcom, Coherent, Lumentum, etc.) are still: * Shipping discrete pluggable modules (400G/800G, etc.). * Using a lot of active alignment and labor-intensive packaging. * Typically putting lasers inside every module, which: * Wastes power * Adds heat right where you don’t want it * Doesn’t scale nicely to 1.6T / 3.2T and giant AI fabrics. **POET’s edge vs “generic” silicon photonics:** * Wafer-scale, passive alignment which lowers capex, lowers assembly cost, and is easier to ramp volume. * Allows hybrid integration: can mix and match best-of-breed lasers with silicon in one platform. * Remote lasers (Starlight) which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package. And if you're wondering if any of this technology has even been validated, look no further than Marvell Technologies, [who purchased one of POET's largest customers]( Celestial AI, for up to $5+ billion. Marvell's main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POET's Optical Interposer and uses POET’s Starlight as a remote laser source. In other words, a serious, blue-chip semi company and at least one hyperscaler ([AWS](#google_vignette)) have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it’s real enough to bet billions and multi-year roadmaps on. You don’t build a next-gen AI fabric around external lasers and wafer-scale photonics if you’re not confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams, BER targets, thermal budgets, and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale. The Marvell/Celestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying: “Yes, this class of photonic solution is how we’re going to attack the I/O wall.” Also, Celestial AI's CEO, [David Lazovsky]( was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAM/SSD shortage? POET obviously doesn’t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD, so the way they solve the shortage is indirect, but very real: they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own. Right now, hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation. They’re paying insane prices for HBM, DRAM, and enterprise SSDs, but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded. You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM, servers with their own DRAM, storage boxes full of flash, and the copper between them can’t move data fast enough. So to keep latency acceptable, the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place, sharding models, caching datasets on every node, and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn’t become a brick wall. That’s fine when RAM is cheap. It’s a killer when HBM/DRAM/flash prices are up 200% over the last month. On the power side, POET’s own FAQ for their 800G/1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators, wirebonds, and gearbox/DSP overhead, they can cut about **6–8 watts of power per module** versus conventional approaches at these speeds. Six to eight watts doesn’t sound like much until you remember you’re not deploying one module, you’re deploying thousands. At 10,000 modules across a big AI cluster, that’s **60–80 kW of power and cooling you’re not wasting just on the optics layer.** That “freed” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rack/power envelope. Then there’s cost. In their Starlight FAQ, POET flat-out says that for Celestial AI, the Starlight external light source is expected to be **up to 75% cheaper than comparable light sources on the market**, thanks to the Optical Interposer’s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly. Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory, which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource. There’s also a quiet supply angle baked in: their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way, and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “dramatic capacity increase” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers. In other words, they’re not just stretching HBM/DRAM/SSD; they’re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device. **Put that together in plain English: a single POET-based engine gives you terabit-class bandwidth in a tiny footprint, saves you several watts per port at 800G/1.6T, cuts your light source cost by as much as three-quarters, and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser. That’s what makes it a lever against the memory/SSD shortages. this results in:** * **GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on I/O.** * **You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency.** * **You can justify architecting shared memory pools and far-flash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable.** So in a world where HBM/DRAM/SSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance, POET’s pitch is basically: “Let us give you 1.6 Tbps-class optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash light-source cost by up to 75%, so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have.” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSD/RAM. **TL;DR** AI has turned HBM/DRAM/flash into the new oil. Prices are ripping, supply is pre-sold years out, and hyperscalers still can’t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAM/SSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs, DRAM pools, and storage. POET attacks that bottleneck: its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “gold box” optics with a wafer-scale, Lego-style optical tile, and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm, making high-bandwidth links cheaper, cooler, and easier to scale. That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabit-class bandwidth, cut power and light-source cost, and reduce stranded/duplicated data, so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBM/DRAM/SSD instead of just brute-forcing with more hardware. In a world where memory is scarce and pre-booked, POET doesn’t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte, and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the big-cap validation that this external-laser, photonic-fabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed. **Position:** Edit: Interesting Statement: “Dave Brown, Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS, commented on Marvell’s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement, stating: “At AWS, we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections, and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure. Building a scalable, high-performance, and power-efficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies. Celestial AI has made impressive progress, and we expect their combination with a large-scale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scale-up innovation for next-generation AI deployments.””",

      "selftext_processed": "Were all fully aware of whats going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD . Kingston sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246 % since early 2025 and says RAMSSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down . SK Hynix is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028 even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory . NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out with doubledigit price hikes locked in . On top of this hyperscalers are only getting about 70 % of the server DRAM they order even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50 % in a single quarter . Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr . Evil prebooking 40 % of the worlds DRAM wafers with money that has yet to be seen . I say all this to say HBMDRAMflash has become the new oil for AI and everyone is fighting over the same barrels . What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn ’ t just how much memory you can buy it ’ s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs DRAM pools and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce . In light of the RAMSSD shortage this has become a conversation about finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands This is where POET ’ s photonic engines come in they don ’ t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBMDRAMflash . So POET has two main products The Optical Interposer think of this as an “ optical motherboard tilechiplet. ” Starlight an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light . Today ’ s optics usually look like this You ’ ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “ gold box. ” Inside that box lasers modulators drivers receivers lenses fiber alignment etc . Every module is handheld robot aligned and tuned . Slow expensive powerhungry . POET ’ s interposer basically says fuck the gold box They take silicon and IIIV lasers and build everything into a flat waferscale platform . Instead of doing micronlevel alignment one module at a time they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pickandplace tools . Fibers line up passively so theres really no_heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved The parts on the interposer are configureable so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer . think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it . To visualize the interposer sits between the hot compute chips GPUsASICsNPUs and the outside world network memory pools storage and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths . Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer . Instead of putting hot fragile lasers on the GPUpackage they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module . That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute . The benefits are Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters GB200 H100 etc .. One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers . Better reliability easier maintenance and lower $ bit because you share the light source across multiple links . So together these two components work like this Starlight shared light source Interposer cheap configurable massproduced optical engine tile that is easily scalable . This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution Most of the big incumbents Broadcom Coherent Lumentum etc . are still Shipping discrete pluggable modules 400G800G etc .. Using a lot of active alignment and laborintensive packaging . Typically putting lasers inside every module which Wastes power Adds heat right where you don ’ t want it Doesn ’ t scale nicely to 1.6T 3.2T and giant AI fabrics . POET ’ s edge vs “ generic ” silicon photonics Waferscale passive alignment which lowers capex lowers assembly cost and is easier to ramp volume . Allows hybrid integration can mix and match bestofbreed lasers with silicon in one platform . Remote lasers Starlight which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package . And if youre wondering if any of this technology has even been validated look no_further than Marvell Technologies who purchased one of POETs largest customers Celestial AI for up to $ 5 billion . Marvells main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POETs Optical Interposer and uses POET ’ s Starlight as a remote laser source . In other words a serious bluechip semi company and at least one hyperscaler AWSgoogle_vignette have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it ’ s real enough to bet billions and multiyear roadmaps on . You don ’ t build a nextgen AI fabric around external lasers and waferscale photonics if you ’ re not_confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams BER targets thermal budgets and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale . The MarvellCelestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying “ Yes this class of photonic solution is how we ’ re going to attack the IO wall. ” Also Celestial AIs CEO David Lazovsky was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAMSSD shortage POET obviously doesn ’ t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD so the way they solve the shortage is indirect but very real they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own . Right now hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation . They ’ re paying insane prices for HBM DRAM and enterprise SSDs but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded . You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM servers with their own DRAM storage boxes full of flash and the copper between them can ’ t move data fast enough . So to keep latency acceptable the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place sharding models caching datasets on every node and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn ’ t become a brick wall . That ’ s fine when RAM is cheap . It ’ s a killer when HBMDRAMflash prices are up 200 % over the last month . On the power side POET ’ s own FAQ for their 800G1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators wirebonds and gearboxDSP overhead they can cut about 6–8 watts of power per module versus conventional approaches at these speeds . Six to eight watts doesn ’ t sound like much until you remember you ’ re not_deploying one module you ’ re deploying thousands . At 10000 modules across a big AI cluster that ’ s 60–80 kW of power and cooling you ’ re not_wasting just on the optics layer . That “ freed ” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rackpower envelope . Then there ’ s cost . In their Starlight FAQ POET flatout says that for Celestial AI the Starlight external light source is expected to be up to 75 % cheaper than comparable light sources on the market thanks to the Optical Interposer ’ s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly . Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource . There ’ s also a quiet supply angle baked in their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “ dramatic capacity increase ” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers . In other words they ’ re not_just stretching HBMDRAMSSD they ’ re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device . Put that together in plain English a single POETbased engine gives you terabitclass bandwidth in a tiny footprint saves you several watts per port at 800G1.6T cuts your light source cost by as much as threequarters and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser . That ’ s what makes it a lever against the memorySSD shortages . this results in GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on IO . You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency . You can justify architecting shared memory pools and farflash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable . So in a world where HBMDRAMSSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance POET ’ s pitch is basically “ Let us give you 1.6 Tbpsclass optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash lightsource cost by up to 75 % so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have. ” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSDRAM . TLDR AI has turned HBMDRAMflash into the new oil . Prices are ripping supply is presold years out and hyperscalers still can ’ t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAMSSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs DRAM pools and storage . POET attacks that bottleneck its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “ gold box ” optics with a waferscale Legostyle optical tile and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm making highbandwidth links cheaper cooler and easier to scale . That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabitclass bandwidth cut power and lightsource cost and reduce strandedduplicated data so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBMDRAMSSD instead of just bruteforcing with more hardware . In a world where memory is scarce and prebooked POET doesn ’ t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the bigcap validation that this externallaser photonicfabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed . Position Edit Interesting Statement “ Dave Brown Vice President of Compute and Machine Learning Services at AWS commented on Marvell ’ s acquisition of Celestial AI in their official announcement stating “ At AWS we aim to be at the forefront of major technology inflections and we believe optical interconnects will play an important role in the future of AI infrastructure . Building a scalable highperformance and powerefficient cloud starts with an approach built upon differentiated technologies . Celestial AI has made impressive progress and we expect their combination with a largescale semiconductor company like Marvell will help further accelerate optical scaleup innovation for nextgeneration AI deployments . ” ”"

      "selftext": "Well at least the near future anyway.. Carvana’s business is going in the garbage. That’s coming from a share holder and a customer 3 times. I’ve referred them to a few friends and my son as well and it’s getting extremely bad. In the beginning I bought a car for my wife, I was laid up from surgery and I wanted to suprise her with a vehicle. I did everything from my couch, the car came in 5 days, she loved it and still has it. The convienance of it was worth it alone. Now you’re lucky to get a car in under a month. That’s not exaggerating because some have waited so long they cancelled. The customer service is non existent, the reason for delays is non existent. They are literally so far behind you can’t get a car. Some would say well their sales are way up, what do you expect. These are vehicles people need and can easily get elsewhere. Take the convienance away and what do you have? A used car with a high interest rate and a dealer that can’t handle any service issues on top of it. Here in Connecticut alone, there’s been 2.5 million dollars settled in law suits already and that’s only the beginning. There’s twice as many complaints this wave and the Attorney General as submitting another gigantic law suit again. That’s just CT. I can’t imagine this company will survive if this is going on in all 50 states. It won’t be long. I’ve sold my shares and actually shorted the stock also with Puts . It was a good idea and with the right people it can be good but this has gotten too bad to fix. Mark my words.",

      "selftext": "Micron Technology (MU) shares rose over 6% in after hours trading on Wednesday after the memory chipmaker reported first quarter fiscal results and guidance that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations. For the fiscal quarter ending 27 November, Micron posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78, with revenue surging 57% year on year to $14.34 billion. Adjusted operating profit reached $6.42 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $8.41 billion a stark contrast to the $3.24 billion recorded in the same period last year. Analysts had previously forecast EPS of $3.95 and revenue of $12.95 billion. Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Micron, stated: ‘In our fiscal first quarter, Micron achieved record revenue with significant margin improvements across the company and all business segments.’ ‘Our outlook for the second quarter indicates significant record-setting levels for revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow, with business performance expected to strengthen further throughout fiscal 2026. Our technological leadership, differentiated product portfolio and robust operational execution position us as an indispensable enabler in the AI landscape, and we continue to invest to meet growing customer demand for memory and storage solutions.’ Looking ahead to the second quarter, Micron anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $8.22 and $8.62, with revenue projected at $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion. This compares to analysts' prior expectations of adjusted EPS of $4.78 and revenue of $14.3 billion.",

      "selftext": "The unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment. Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending. For those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average. Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average. Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. The current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal. If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above the moving average low). As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print. The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next. TL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 >4.7%, risk off. If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.",

      "selftext": "Been investing for years, but I went all in on options (mostly TSLA and CVNA puts) earlier this year. Big mistake. Wiped out almost my entire account. Down from $120k to $5k in a matter of weeks. Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem, so options aren’t a good idea for me. Went back to basics: aka penny stocks. I’ve got a lot of experience (good and bad) with small caps, and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD. Only issue is I didn’t have cash to play with. Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never taking out loans. So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me. This turned out to only be about $30k, which wasn’t enough, so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances. After a few months of this I maxed out around $80k in debt. I knew this was dumb, but fuck it! Somehow things panned out pretty well, and as of today I have finally broken even! What’s next: I’m going to keep rolling with this strategy, but will pair down the debt significantly. Mainly just the credit card debt, with a target around $20k debt, which at 25% utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again. Once I hit $500k, I’ll clear the debt fully. Takeaways: \\- Don’t short meme stocks \\- Short term options are not worth the risk \\- Learn from your mistakes and seek help \\- Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025, I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024. Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts. Shockingly, the lower fees didn’t help much. \\-------- EDIT ---------- Seeing a lot of people saying they're in a similar position to me, so just to be clear: **I got lucky, and risked blowing my account up beyond repair. If you're in a similar position, please seek help** through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist. If you've had similar losses, you're almost certainly also a gambling addict, and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been investing for years but I went all in on options mostly TSLA and CVNA puts earlier this year . Big mistake . Wiped out almost my entire account . Down from $ 120k to $ 5k in a matter of weeks . Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem so options aren ’ t a good idea for me . Went back to basics aka penny stocks . I ’ ve got a lot of experience good and bad with small caps and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD . Only issue is I didn ’ t have cash to play with . Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never_taking out loans . So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me . This turned out to only be about $ 30k which wasn ’ t enough so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances . After a few months of this I maxed out around $ 80k in debt . I knew this was dumb but fuck it Somehow things panned out pretty well and as of today I have finally broken even What ’ s next I ’ m going to keep rolling with this strategy but will pair down the debt significantly . Mainly just the credit card debt with a target around $ 20k debt which at 25 % utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again . Once I hit $ 500k I ’ ll clear the debt fully . Takeaways Don ’ t short meme stocks Short term options are not_worth the risk Learn from your mistakes and seek help Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025 I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024 . Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts . Shockingly the lower fees didn ’ t help much . EDIT Seeing a lot of people saying theyre in a similar position to me so just to be clear I got lucky and risked blowing my account up beyond repair . If youre in a similar position please seek help through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist . If youve had similar losses youre almost certainly also a gambling addict and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else ."

      "selftext": "I'd be curious to hear opinions on Wealthfront's recent IPO -- ticker WLTH. Not that it matters much, but my own background: The majority of my portfolio is pretty bog standard broad ETFs -- yes, the lion's share in a 401k with pretty boring allocations via your standard mix of blocks. I have a taxable investment account with Wealthfront *and* an individual account I use for individual equities. Why both? Well, I hit a jackpot in my individual account (bought into NVDA in 2020) and also had some other success stories... and ironically? I always told myself \"If you can't beat the robots, you're just spending money on a hobby\". 5+ years later - I'm still winning. So... that brings me to the individual stock in question. I'm a long-term, buy-and-hold guy. I **prefer** to invest in equities where I have some experience/knowledge of the underlying company. I bought into TOST at its trough a bit ago (\\~17) on the same front - profitable, but IPO out of the gate at \\~70. However, my brother is a restauranteur and through him, I've talked with plenty of others - and I felt it was really best-in-class, like their growth, and while not a huge win like NVDA? It's certainly paid off - and I continue to like it under \\~35. And... I've used Wealthfront - it's my primary HYSA nowadays (though not my only one, but my largest) and as noted, also have a taxable \"robo-ETF\" account with them. I've been a customer for nearly 7 years now -- and I *do* give them high marks. I really like the platform. I really like the ingenuity. As much as I don't avail myself? I also like them dipping into further fintech area. My baseline thoughts - On the plus side: \\- Fairly rare for an IPO to already be profitable. They are \\- The P/E looks fine - \\~15. \\- Still showing growth \\- Expanding offerings On the pause/minus side: \\- HIGHLY competitive space - when I chose Wealthfront? Nearly a coinflip between them and Betterment. Robinhood, a bazillion others -- HIGHLY competitive \\- Growth is tailing off - still growing, but no longer a multiplier. \\- Never had good luck with financials I don't believe in trying to \"time\" buys -- and as with nearly every IPO, they're bleeding off a bit. But... I like the company. Part of me wants to wait a few quarters and compare some 10-Qs... the other part says I like the company, like the financials, etc. Would love to hear other thoughts....",

It went public in September and the stock price is down 71%. It still trades at a $875M market cap and this makes no sense to me. This thing should be trading at no more than $250M. This is troublesome: \\- Its cash + accounts receivable balance as of Sep 2025 = $86M \\- It's net loss year-to-date as of Sep 2025 YTD = $92M \\- And it owes in current liabilities $113M as of Sep 2025 I don't know how this thing isn't already insolvent. The only thing it has going for it is that it has recurring annual revenue of $115M from its subscribers (although I've had two friends try to cancel their subscriptions and the process was painful for them). But the flip side of these subscribers is they are spending soooo much money to acquire and retain new subscribers. They spent $177M in sales and marketing YTD Sep 2025. This is insane! The unit economics don't work for this business, especially for a business that relies on 'hits'--getting a hit movie or series. I feel like this thing is going to $0.",

      "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid",
      "selftext": "Warner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value. Multiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Netflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share. Paramount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval. A Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment. Why Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix Warner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous. This has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion. Shortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump. An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.” In a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization. The letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.” Warner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer. “The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.” Although Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.",

      "selftext_processed": "Warner Bros . Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydances $ 108.4 billion hostile takeover bid stating the offer posed “ significant risks and costs ” to the company while Netflixs earlier proposal held greater value . Multiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros . Discovery which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series . On December 5 Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros . Discovery for $ 82.7 billion Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8 offering to acquire the entire media group for $ 30 per share in an allcash deal . Netflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros. HBO and its streaming and studio businesses including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television for $ 27.75 per share . Paramount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “ a superior allcash offer ” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros . Discovery . Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discoverys assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance parent company of CBS News would facilitate regulatory approval . A Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not_yet responded to requests for comment . Why Warner Bros . Discovery Favors Netflix Warner Bros . Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures offer stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable . The company also indicated its analysis found Netflixs proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous . This has also raised concerns about the $ 40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media . Warner Bros . Discovery responded by stating “ The Ellison family has made no_investment commitment of any kind. ” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index David Ellisons father Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is the worlds fifthrichest person with a net worth of $ 243 billion . Shortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dances financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid . Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner soninlaw of former U.S. President Donald Trump . An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dances acquisition proposal holds “ strong strategic merit ” it decided to withdraw due to “ significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October. ” In a letter to shareholders the Warner Bros . Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health higher credit ratings and greater market capitalization . The letter stated “ Netflixs merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $ 400 billion and an investmentgrade balance sheet. ” Warner Bros . Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dances credit rating “ is at or just one notch above ‘ junk ’ status with two major rating agencies ” while its market capitalization stands at $ 15 billion . Warner Bros . Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramounts plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer . “ The trusts assets and liabilities would not_be publicly disclosed and could change ” it wrote in its letter to shareholders . “ As the name implies revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time. ” Although Wednesdays shareholder letter indicated that Paramounts acquisition offer is not_favored by Warner Bros. board shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramounts bid for the entire company including cable assets such as CNN Discovery and TNT ."

      "selftext": "So, I came across some news on Zhito Finance. The global AI tech industry is booming, and almost all the infrastructure supporting it is growing fast. Major Wall Street players like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan are even restructuring their TMT (Tech, Media, and Telecom) investment banking teams. Goldman Sachs just released a field report on the AI computing power supply chain in Asia. They expect demand for AI server clusters to keep growing strongly through 2026. The demand for optical network equipment is also super high, and while DRAM storage chip supply is still growing slowly, demand is far outstripping supply. Now, Nvidia’s stock has been climbing like crazy, and the AI market demand is massive. It feels like a strong signal to jump in and make some quick gains. But my friends keep telling me the price is too high right now and I should be cautious. I don’t wanna miss this chance, though. What do you all think? I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice. Thanks a lot!",

      "selftext_processed": "So I came across some news on Zhito Finance . The global AI tech industry is booming and almost all the infrastructure supporting it is growing fast . Major Wall Street players like Goldman Sachs Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are even restructuring their TMT Tech Media and Telecom investment banking teams . Goldman Sachs just released a field report on the AI computing power supply chain in Asia . They expect demand for AI server clusters to keep growing strongly through 2026 . The demand for optical network equipment is also super high and while DRAM storage chip supply is still growing slowly demand is far outstripping supply . Now Nvidia ’ s stock has been climbing like crazy and the AI market demand is massive . It feels like a strong signal to jump in and make some quick gains . But my friends keep telling me the price is too high right now and I should be cautious . I don ’ t wan na miss this chance though . What do you all think I ’ d love to hear your thoughts and advice . Thanks a lot"

      "selftext": "Microcaps can move in a self reinforcing way because the shareholder base is small and liquidity is thin. A single expectation change can attract incremental volume, which changes visibility, which can change financing terms and media coverage. That loop does not require perfection. It only requires the market to believe the next few quarters look better than the last few. RIME has a few ingredients that make this dynamic possible. The company is around a $5M market cap, and it already shows up in institutional filings. Fintel compiled data lists Vanguard Group at about 20,010 shares and Geode Capital Management at about 19,606 shares, alongside index fund exposure through extended market funds (source type: 13F and NPORT filings as compiled by Fintel). Those are small positions, but they confirm the ticker sits inside institutional data systems. On the business side, SemiCab slides shown privately cite ARR rising from about $2.1M to roughly $15.0M over about 18 months, plus enterprise contracts sized above $5M per year and one above $8M per year (source: company presentation). If even part of that trajectory becomes visible in public filings, the valuation could reset from a low base. Do your own research.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching the Warner Bros situation, and it’s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals, except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war. The latest development is pretty straightforward. Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.]( Netflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid. What makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal. Paramount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper. WBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been watching the Warner Bros situation and it ’ s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war . The latest development is pretty straightforward . Jared Kushner ’ s PE firm Affinity Partners has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance ’ s hostile bid . From what ’ s been reported it was only about a $ 200M check in the grand scheme of things but it still mattered . It wasn ’ t a big piece of the financing but it was a politically connected name and that backing is now gone . News source if you ’ re interested Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy Pivot To Theaters . Netflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $ 27.75 per share or roughly $ 72B . Paramount Skydance countered with a $ 30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders . The reporting so far suggests WBD ’ s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid . What makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal . Paramount ’ s bid comes with big name backers but it also brings political baggage . The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper . WBD ’ s Q3 2025 release showed about $ 9.0B in revenue down excluding FX . The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks especially with the debt load still hanging over the company . That ’ s why Affinity walking away doesn ’ t really change how I read the situation . It hurts the optics of the hostile bid but it doesn ’ t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler ."

      "selftext": "SP500 dips whenever there's an earning call, and Micron earning call probably make all of us bleed again this week, especially with the RAM fuckery going on. GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410, along with all shelter miners. Crypto-adjacent securities are not surging because crypto is still limp. Now yen is getting stronger, dollar getting cheaper, and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities, and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next. Nomura and Mizuho (ADRs) NMR / MFG are incredibly undervalued, two of the three top-tier Japanese banks, and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates, and crafters of these new policies. They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first government-backed crypto stable yen, which basically means state-adjacent crypto finance from big lenders... the potential is quite huge. Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley, which still gets ignored. NMR’s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts. NMR’s dividend yield is higher than most so-called dividend princesses or whatever the name is. MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin, and NMR is the reason for that. They’ve been moving slowly in the ADRs, and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year. Price action alone (USD/JPY echange rate) is making this change, higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less. Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive, and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online, the deranged fantasy of getting cheap low-interest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests... will be not only a reality, but a practice.",

Now yen is getting stronger dollar getting cheaper and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next . Nomura and Mizuho ADRs NMR MFG are incredibly undervalued two of the three toptier Japanese banks and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates and crafters of these new policies . They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first governmentbacked crypto stable yen which basically means stateadjacent crypto finance from big lenders ... the potential is quite huge . Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley which still gets ignored . NMR ’ s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts . NMR ’ s dividend yield is higher than most socalled dividend princesses or whatever the name is . MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin and NMR is the reason for that . They ’ ve been moving slowly in the ADRs and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year .

      "selftext": "I’m currently managing a mid-7-figure portfolio that’s done well, but it’s basically a \"barbell\" right now: 1/3 cash and nearly 1/2 heavy tech concentration. With the Fed cutting and the 2026 outlook looking messy (deficits, tariffs, etc), I'm trying to move from passive holding into a more defensive macro setup. Current mess: - 43% Tech/Nasdaq (QQQ plus heavy single stock exposure in Mag 7) - 31% Cash (mostly SPAXX/Money Market at 5%) - 20% S&P 500 - 6% International (Total world) The Issues: 1. Cash drag: 31% in cash as rates drop to 3-3.5% is just asking for income erosion. 2. Overlap: Owning QQQ plus individual tech names is redundant. 3. China risk: My current international fund is weighed down by China, which I want out of for 2026. Proposed New Target: I’m planning to dump the Nasdaq index and broad international funds to clean up the overlap and China risk, then move the bulk of the cash into intermediate bonds and some \"real economy\" hedges. 33% - High Conviction Tech (Single names only): Retaining my highest conviction plays directly to avoid the \"fluff\" in QQQ. I see these as cash flow plays that are safer than the broader index. 20% - S&P 500 (IVV): My boring core. 18% - Intermediate Corp Bonds (VCIT): Moving the cash here to lock in ~4.8% yields and get some capital appreciation as the Fed continues to cut. Preferring corporates over treasuries for the extra cushion. 9% - Mid-Cap Value (VOE): This is my \"real economy\" play. Targets industrials/financials that should benefit from onshoring and a steeper yield curve. Helps me diversify away from the Mag 7. 8% - EM ex-China (VEXC): Swapping broad international for EM excluding China. I want the growth in India/Vietnam/Taiwan without the China drag. 7% - Cash (SPAXX): Just keeping some dry powder for emergencies/opportunities. 5% - Bitcoin (IBIT): Hedge against fiscal debasement/deficits. Questions for you guys: 1. Is moving that much cash into VCIT (Intermediate Corps) the right way to play the rate cycle, or is the credit risk too high if things get recessionary? 2. Is the Ex-China (VEXC) play actually effective for international growth, or should I just stick to developed markets? Appreciate any thoughts or sanity checks on this.",

Today it lost 62k and I’m so confused. Nasdaq was up at closing, S&P and Dow only down a bit. I understand everyone is concerned about the ai bubble etc but when I looked to see how the individual stocks (Microsoft, NVIdia, Apple etc) performed they were all mostly up or relatively low.

      "selftext": "Warner Bros. Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders. The market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. Also, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

      "selftext_processed": "Warner Bros . Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance ’ s hostile takeover bid with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday according to people familiar with the matter . Paramount ’ s proposal valued Warner Bros . Discovery at roughly $ 108 billion in an allcash offer or about $ 30 per share but board members have expressed concerns over the offer ’ s financing structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options . The board appears inclined to recommend the company ’ s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders . The market has reacted to the escalating deal drama with Warner Bros. Discovery ’ s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated . Investors are watching closely as Paramount ’ s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance and as other players like Netflix remain in contention . Also Jared Kushner ’ s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid . Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January but Warner Bros. Discovery ’ s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders"

      "selftext": "Before this post gets vamooshed for low effort posting, let me preface by saying I'm going to try my best not to make this the basic post the title suggests it is. I know there's a million threads about this. Statistically, unless you're retiring soon, putting everything into the market is better than trying to time it and holding cash, and waiting. That said, I am helping my father invest a sizeable amount of money in the market. He's always said that the markets are crazy overvalued, so he has kept his money invested in small local businesses. However, as he gets older, he wants to shift some funds into the market. Let's say he has a couple of million waiting to put into the market. Currently, it's sitting in SGOV. Would it be wise to start DCAing and holding cash for a crash, or should he allocate everything ASAP (into a broad market ETF)? Also, assume this would be money he could lose and still retire as he still has significant diversified local business equity. I know by asking this I'm contradicting what I said in the preface of this post, but for a while now, it's felt like another harsh correction is overdue. As a young investor myself, it's hard for me to piece together if things are really the same as always, or if anything is actually different this time. Especially with the current administration going guns blazing with economic and foreign policy. I'd love some more seasoned investors to share their input. On one side, P/E ratios suggest a bubble, but on the other hand, some say this is just the new kind of market we're living in. I don't expect a definitive answer (since I don't think anyone really knows), but I wanted to get some real people's opinions.",

      "selftext": "# ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday, December 19th, with massive forced selling incoming. The $3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) is rebalancing and must dump $30 million in RGTI shares and another $10 million in IONQ. This isn't speculation; it's a mechanical event. RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day, meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float. Calculation: RGTI is part of other ETFs also the one's circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19-Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities. Since most other ETFs are bond+stock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome, but the point remains - RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a P/E that's negative EPS < 0 and stock price too high # Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell, insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years. There have been **zero insider purchases since June 2022**. The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th. Most damning of all, **the CEO owns zero shares** in the company he runs. The people with all the information are showing zero confidence. Last sell was 7 days ago 9-Dec. This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals. RGTI has a $10 billion market cap but generated less than $2 million in revenue last quarter. It's burning through $43.6 million in cash every 9 months, propped up by selling shares to retail investors. The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality. This Friday, a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no fundamental support. The correction is going to be brutal. **Position: +100 RGTZ. Total of 350 RGTZ.** NFA...obvi.",

      "selftext_processed": "ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday December 19th with massive forced selling incoming . The $ 3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM is rebalancing and must dump $ 30 million in RGTI shares and another $ 10 million in IONQ . This isnt speculation its a mechanical event . RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float . Calculation RGTI is part of other ETFs also the ones circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities . Since most other ETFs are bondstock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome but the point remains RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a PE thats negative EPS 0 and stock price too high Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years . There have been zero insider purchases since June 2022 . The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th . Most damning of all the CEO owns zero shares in the company he runs . The people with all the information are showing zero confidence . Last sell was 7 days ago 9Dec . This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals . RGTI has a $ 10 billion market cap but generated less than $ 2 million in revenue last quarter . Its burning through $ 43.6 million in cash every 9 months propped up by selling shares to retail investors . The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality . This Friday a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no_fundamental support . The correction is going to be brutal . Position 100 RGTZ . Total of 350 RGTZ . NFA ... obvi ."

      "selftext": "Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers - This Is the Core Problem The Carry Trader: A Forced Seller When the yen spikes-typically after a BoJ hike-carry traders are instantly underwater. They’re not selling U.S. equities by choice; they’re selling because margin calls leave them no alternative. These are forced liquidations. Cash is needed immediately, so they hit the bid at any price. The Domestic Buyer: Optional and Patient Yes, U.S. rate cuts are supportive for equities over time. But domestic investors are not compelled to buy today. Watching markets fall amid a carry unwind, their instinct is to wait: “Let’s see where the bottom is.” The result? A surge of “sell-at-any-price” orders and a vacuum of “buy-now” demand. Liquidity disappears, an air pocket forms, and prices freefall. The 10x Multiplier Effect Carry trades are rarely 1:1 with cash. They’re highly leveraged, often 5x–10x. Unwinding a $1B carry position can require dumping $5B–$10B in assets-often U.S. tech-to repay funding. By contrast, a domestic buyer stepping in after a 25 bp rate cut is typically buying cash, 1:1. The math is brutal: it can take ten domestic buyers to absorb the damage from one carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is extreme. Convergence Is What Kills the Trade Remember: the carry trade is pure arbitrage. It exists only because of a wide rate divergence between the U.S. and Japan. Wide gap: feels like free money-everyone piles in. Gap closing (convergence): the free money vanishes. Crucially, U.S. rate cuts don’t relieve the pressure-they intensify it. Returns are squeezed on the U.S. side while funding costs rise as the BoJ tightens. This isn’t a gentle “meeting in the middle”; it’s a pincer movement.",

      "selftext": "I'm taking JOYY as one of my cases, it has footprint on SEA and Middle East. They operate like a tech holding company,, consumer facing apps that can generate cash flow with solutions for business and also for the business future growth. JOYY balance sheet performance is solid. The balance sheet looks unusually strong compared to where the stock trades today.. This allows the management to return capital to their shareholders in an aggressive way through dividends and share buybacks. JOYY offers shareholders yield nearly 9%, which looks every attractive as Treasury yield are expected to fall when Fed rate cuts. the company is positioning itself into AdTech and SaaS segments. a forward PE 12.5x, it shows JOYY as a mature growth app company. The consumer apps still appear to fund the rest of the business for now. in Q3, live stream enhanced $399 mil in revenue.. Also the company is trying to reduce its reliance on single revenue stream. As we can see in the market nowadays, the livestream has been declined, but theirr solution is scaling rapidly. Advertising revenue up to more than 29% YoY. BIGO Ads generated $103.9 million in revenue, up to over 33% YoY. What I’m still trying to figure out is whether BIGO Ads can really become a meaningful external ad network over time. in 2026, JOYY plan to expand into IOS. The company focused on Android users before, which aligned very well with earlier market strategy. But now the management is shifting into a higher quality traffic. IOS expansion is a good strategy to have higher ARPU users in North America and Europe. In their Q3, ad requests from SDK networks increased by 230% YoY. At the same time, JOYY invested in AI driven ad. These capabilities improve advertiser ROI and help with high value clients in the long run. The AdTech market is expected to grow in the future. In parallel, JOYY is building its ecommerce SaaS business. Overall if their BIGO can maintain 20-25% growth rate, their revenue mix could look different in the next few years. If that happens, a re-rating makes sense on paper, but execution here matters a lot.",

They operate like a tech holding company consumer facing apps that can generate cash flow with solutions for business and also for the business future growth . JOYY balance sheet performance is solid . The balance sheet looks unusually strong compared to where the stock trades today .. This allows the management to return capital to their shareholders in an aggressive way through dividends and share buybacks . JOYY offers shareholders yield nearly 9 % which looks every attractive as Treasury yield are expected to fall when Fed rate cuts . the company is positioning itself into AdTech and SaaS segments . a forward PE 12.5x it shows JOYY as a mature growth app company . The consumer apps still appear to fund the rest of the business for now . in Q3 live stream enhanced $ 399 mil in revenue .. Also the company is trying to reduce its reliance on single revenue stream . As we can see in the market nowadays the livestream has been declined but theirr solution is scaling rapidly . Advertising revenue up to more than 29 % YoY . BIGO Ads generated $ 103.9 million in revenue up to over 33 % YoY . What I ’ m still trying to figure out is whether BIGO Ads can really become a meaningful external ad network over time . in 2026 JOYY plan to expand into IOS . The company focused on Android users before which aligned very well with earlier market strategy . But now the management is shifting into a higher quality traffic . IOS expansion is a good strategy to have higher ARPU users in North America and Europe . In their Q3 ad requests from SDK networks increased by 230 % YoY .

      "selftext": "What stands out here is not one headline. It is repetition. Over the last stretch, Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary. Domperidone was approved, followed by doxycycline, and then Pravastatin. For a microcap pharma, clearing even one approval can take years. Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works, not a lucky break. Each of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand. That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue, not distant milestones. This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings, while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M. Despite that, SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range. That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not matter financially. Historically, chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution. Do your own research.",

      "title": "Not Every Small Biotech Is Pre-Revenue, This One Already Sells Product",
      "selftext": "There is a reflex reaction in small-cap trading where people hear the word biotech and immediately assume no revenue and constant dilution. That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM. Sunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M, yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales. That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range, many of which generate no commercial revenue at all. This revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary, not from speculative trial assets. The company has been expanding its product lineup, which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline. That does not remove risk, but it changes the conversation. When a stock trades as if the business does not exist, even basic awareness can shift sentiment. In low-float names, that shift does not require perfect fundamentals, only consistency and visibility.

That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM . Sunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales . That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range many of which generate no_commercial revenue at all . This revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary not_from speculative trial assets . The company has been expanding its product lineup which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline . That does not_remove risk but it changes the conversation . When a stock trades as if the business does not_exist even basic awareness can shift sentiment . In lowfloat names that shift does not_require perfect fundamentals only consistency and visibility .

      "selftext": "In January 2023, when market sentiment for crypto equities was very negative, I initiated a portfolio of a basket of beaten-down names. One such name was Coinbase Global ($COIN). I initiated a position buying 1,850 shares, mostly in the mid-$30s, when the stock price was implying worst-case scenarios. The original thesis was never about growth; it was about survivability and operational leverage. The volumes in crypto had cratered, there was a lot of regulatory risk, but Coinbase had a strong balance sheet, was rapidly cutting costs, and was the most well-regulated and friendly-way-of-entering-the-crypto-market in the U.S. Fast-forward to today, and it looks like a vastly different market. Prices and activity are strong, institutional participation has risen substantially, and the earnings power of Coinbase showed exactly what kind of operating leverage had fixed costs. It re-rated sharply from distressed prices. However, at current prices, rather than pricing survival, it’s pricing adoption and domination across the crypto space. Currently, trading commissions are generating most of the revenue, and this indicates a highly cyclical nature of the business despite improved subscription and service revenue. To be honest, I’m not as committed anymore. My gut is starting to lean toward exiting the trade rather than holding through another full cycle. The easy money was made when sentiment was broken; now it feels more like a risk vs reward decision. Anyyy counter arguments, facts or datapoints to change my mind...???",

      "selftext": "Waymo grew its lead in the robotaxi market in 2025, and is now operating, planning to launch a service or testing its vehicles in 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad. Amazon’s Zoox began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December. Robotaxis felt like science fiction just a decade ago, but this year, autonomous vehicles became a commonplace option for paying passengers across big cities in the U.S. and parts of Asia. Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominates the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go dominated in China. Some parents are now sending teens to schools and activities in Waymos, and women often praise the privacy of these AVs versus rides with strangers who drive for ride-hailing and traditional taxi services. Additionally, the company has begun testing vehicles in New York and Tokyo, two of the most dense cities in which Waymo has started driving. The company hasn’t yet specified service launch timelines for those markets. Waymo, in particular, has been so successful in its commercial expansion that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival’s achievements after previously criticizing the Google sister company. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk thanked Waymo for “paving the path here” when it comes to working out the regulatory approvals that allow robotaxi services to do business across much of the U.S. In 2026, Waymo plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. The company also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark Waymo’s first overseas service region. Waymo leads the 2025 robotaxi surge as Zoox expands and Tesla races to catch up",

Amazon ’ s Zoox began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods . Tesla launched a Robotaxibranded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of midDecember . Robotaxis felt like science fiction just a decade ago but this year autonomous vehicles became a commonplace option for paying passengers across big cities in the U.S. and parts of Asia . Alphabetowned Waymo kept expanding and dominates the robotaxi market in the U.S. though rivals Tesla and Amazonowned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025 . Meanwhile Baiduowned Apollo Go dominated in China . Some parents are now sending teens to schools and activities in Waymos and women often praise the privacy of these AVs versus rides with strangers who drive for ridehailing and traditional taxi services . Additionally the company has begun testing vehicles in New York and Tokyo two of the most dense cities in which Waymo has started driving . The company hasn ’ t yet specified service launch timelines for those markets . Waymo in particular has been so successful in its commercial expansion that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival ’ s achievements after previously criticizing the Google sister company . At Tesla ’ s annual meeting on Nov. 6 Musk thanked Waymo for “ paving the path here ” when it comes to working out the regulatory approvals that allow robotaxi services to do business across much of the U.S . In 2026 Waymo plans to open service in Dallas Denver Detroit Houston Las Vegas Miami Nashville Orlando San Antonio San Diego and Washington D.C . The company also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026 which will mark Waymo ’ s first overseas service region . Waymo leads the 2025 robotaxi surge as Zoox expands and Tesla races to catch up"

      "selftext": "I find myself with $100,000 USD in my bank account. I've never had this much money before. I'm 30 with very minimal investments. I'd like to best use this as my first big step towards eventual financial independence (hopefully). I have about $10,000 left in student debt (interest free). No other debt. I have a mid 700 credit score. I commonly see 3 similar investment methods that are recommended. 1. 100% VOO. Something about Jack Bogle saying US. stock are international because those companies operate internally. 2. VTI one and done. I believe 15% international exposure. 3. VOO and VXUS so you can rebalance if seen necessary. Far be it from me to believe I could determine a more optimized \"split\" than is offered in VTI. I'm fairly young. I can handle the volatility. I personally don't see the need to have bonds in my portfolio at the moment. Am I on the right track? Would you steer me towards one of these three options, or somewhere else entirely? Your input is much appreciated.",

      "title": "WW International Inc. - Expected to benefit from the GLP-1 trend",
      "selftext": "Hi guys, I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc. I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand I'm not allowed to share it here. For refernce, I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing, the niche I am trying to master are distressed / turnaround equties. I'm still relatively new to writing and valuation so I'd appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals. Shares currently trading at $24.28 per share, based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $35.52 per share and a price of $47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario. WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70% of their debt from \\~$1.6 billion to a manageable \\~$466 million. Leverage based on $145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x post-emergence to previously being at 11x. Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline, however their clinical segment is growing aggresively. They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x, I feel like with the reduced leverage, high growth in the clinical segment, and cash generation, WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $52.18 per share. They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which protects them from litigation risk. The GLP-1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal. Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies, and the FDA has issued warnings. Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 (pre-bankruptcy) seeing the company as a deep value opportunity. Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not meet the criteria for insolvency, making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders. Galloway believes that there was no exigency to WW’s bankruptcy filing, considering that the overwhelming majority of WW’s funded debt is not due until 2028 and 2029, and WW’s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest. There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga, check it out [here]( Get this, if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x, what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses. Additionally, in Bankruptcy law, there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC. In 99% of distress-for-control deals, the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement (RRA) in the bankruptcy proceedings. I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not find a RRA. Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91% control. It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights. The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround (1-2 years) rather than flipping it immediately (especially considering Galloway’s interest). There was a post on VIC on WW in June, when shares were trading at \\~$40, the writer's estimate was around \\~$65-$75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I would've missed or are incorrect. Thank you!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi guys I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc . I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand Im not_allowed to share it here . For refernce I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing the niche I am trying to master are distressed turnaround equties . Im still relatively new to writing and valuation so Id appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals . Shares currently trading at $ 24.28 per share based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $ 35.52 per share and a price of $ 47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario . WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70 % of their debt from $ 1.6 billion to a manageable $ 466 million . Leverage based on $ 145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x postemergence to previously being at 11x . Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline however their clinical segment is growing aggresively . They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x I feel like with the reduced leverage high growth in the clinical segment and cash generation WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $ 52.18 per share . They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk which protects them from litigation risk . The GLP1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal . Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies and the FDA has issued warnings . Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 prebankruptcy seeing the company as a deep value opportunity . Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not_meet the criteria for insolvency making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders . Galloway believes that there was no_exigency to WW ’ s bankruptcy filing considering that the overwhelming majority of WW ’ s funded debt is not_due until 2028 and 2029 and WW ’ s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest . There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga check it out here Get this if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses . Additionally in Bankruptcy law there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S1 registration statement with the SEC . In 99 % of distressforcontrol deals the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement RRA in the bankruptcy proceedings . I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not_find a RRA . Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91 % control . It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights . The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround 12 years rather than flipping it immediately especially considering Galloway ’ s interest . There was a post on VIC on WW in June when shares were trading at $ 40 the writers estimate was around $ 65 $ 75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I wouldve missed or are incorrect . Thank you"

      "title": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is",
      "selftext": "# Introduction The reported cuts to the Reality Labs’ budget have likely been overstated. First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out? If we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI. This metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue. Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950. Image: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think. # Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility. In 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’. Around 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world. And of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction. It is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns. # Two Scenarios To help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue. **Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend** Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future. As we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry. # Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success To support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation. # Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood. While I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting. When it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario. Image: Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. Given the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock. # Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do As with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front. If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe. # Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire. \\---------------------------------------- Check out my Substack for more valuations like this.",

      "selftext_processed": "Introduction The reported cuts to the Reality Labs ’ budget have likely been overstated . First it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect . Will it just be VR and the Metaverse or will augmented reality smart glasses be included Reports are of 10 % and 30 % cuts . Again how will this be spread out If we assume it is 30 % of the entirety of Reality Labs which I don ’ t believe . With expenses of $ 16 billion that would be over $ 4 billion in cuts . But remember Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $ 116 $ 118 billion in 2025 which will accelerate in 2026 . $ 4 billion is not_all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI . This metaverse cut is not_that big of a deal . What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas ’ willingness to cut it back if needed . Therefore I see two likely outcomes for Meta . One Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI or two AI will be a success and the high spend will continue . Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases I find Meta to be good value in either scenario . I get a weighted valuation of $ 950 . Image Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasnt able to add images you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them . Oh I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was autoblocking the post I think . Zuckerbergs Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg ’ s willingness to change should not_have come as a massive surprise . There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerbergs career where he has shown this flexibility . In 2008 he embraced advertising something he had long had doubts about brought in Cheryl Sandberg and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘ Adult in the room ’ . Around 2010 Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a webbased platform without the need for a dedicated app . When that was proven wrong they pivoted . Before long they had one of the most popular apps in the world . And of course more recently they went all in on the metaverse even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 . Then in the 2022 Q4 report they announced the ‘ year of efficiency ’ . I see last weeks reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction . It is this history that gives me and I believe some of the market faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not_generating the desired returns . Two Scenarios To help me value the company I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them . Scenario 1 AI returns do not_appear and cuts in CapEx are needed . Scenario 2 AI leads to increased revenue . Scenario 1 Cuts to AI spend Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business . Most analysts expect over 15 % growth in the next 12 months . In this scenario Im going to assume it ends there . Algorithms are as optimised as they can get there are no_more efficiencies to find and no_new AI revenue sources appear . Image DCF Model For Scenario 1 Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8 % which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5 % . This may seem high given a failed AI pivot but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media . Ad spend is still migrating to online the world especially outside the US is getting richer and there is no_reason to think that Meta will not_continue to grow for the foreseeable future . As we discussed in his history I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend . Barring any writedown this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books . I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current 40 % to a terminal margin of 49 % . And for the terminal reinvestment Im assuming a return on invested capital of 20 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together . I get a valuation of $ 861 . So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout there is a case for Meta to be good value . With that said it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation which could allow for an even more attractive entry . Scenario 2 AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model . I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI . I am modelling them to have 20 % growth trailing off to 15 % in 4 years and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5 % . Image DCF Model For Scenario 2 AI Moderate Success To support this growth I am continuing the high CapEx spend but with that said I am assuming that the costs are frontloaded and relative to revenue CapEx will actually fail . I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady with a terminal rate of 37 % . For the terminal reinvestment I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $ 1115 . Of course there is plenty of room in this AI moderate success scenario for more upside . I see this as a conservative valuation . Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model I like to get a weighted average between them which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood . While I believe AI will be transformational Im not_convinced Meta will be the one to build it . For that reason Im putting ‘ reduced CapEx ’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65 % weighting . When it comes to AI if a company wants to be successful it will need piles of money abundant sources of data and a willingness to go for it . Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that . I am putting a weighting of 35 % on the ‘ AI moderately successful ’ scenario . Image Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail . It is black or white but I do like to work in the grey middle so for my overall valuation I will be using this weighted average of $ 950 . Given the different potential outcomes it will be important to regularly update this model and my $ 950 valuation . For now I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock . Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his supervoting rights . And while in the past hes shown a willingness to change direction . A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person . If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him there is not_much we can do As with any international company there will be regulation and antitrust risk . From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban there is a constant risk on this front . If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be there is no_valuation model no_company and perhaps no_industry that is safe . Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not_the real story here . The real story is that once again Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed . The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net . If AI succeeds great shareholders will reap the rewards . If it fails Zuckerberg will cut his losses rightsize the company and continue to run the worlds largest social media empire .

      "selftext": "1. Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers This is the main issue * The Carry Trader: When the Yen spikes (because the BoJ hiked), these guys are underwater immediately. They aren’t selling U.S. stocks because they *want* to; they are selling because they are getting margin called. They are forced sellers. They need cash T-minus now. They hit the bid, regardless of the price. * The Domestic Buyer: Sure, U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks. But if you're a domestic investor, you aren't forced to buy *today*. You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think, \"I'll wait for the bottom.\" So you have a flood of \"sell at any price\" orders and a total lack of \"buy right now\" orders. That creates an air pocket, and prices freefall. 2. The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never 1:1 with cash. They are highly leveraged, often 5x or 10x. If a fund unwinds a $1B carry trade, they might have to dump $5B to $10B worth of assets (like U.S. Tech stocks) to pay back the loan. A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25% rate cut is likely buying with cash (1:1). Math: It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is insane. 3. Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play. It only exists because there is a massive gap (divergence) between U.S. and JP rates. * Wide Gap: Free money. Everyone piles in. * Gap Closing (Convergence): The free money is gone. The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader. It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side. It’s not a \"meeting in the middle,\" it’s a pincer movement. TL;DR: Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains. Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire. One group is much faster and more violent than the other.",

They hit the bid regardless of the price . The Domestic Buyer Sure U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks . But if youre a domestic investor you arent forced to buy today . You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think Ill wait for the bottom . So you have a flood of sell at any price orders and a total lack of buy right now orders .

      "selftext": "TLDR: Altria is a deep value buy. The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood. The market doesn't see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers (largely young, non smokers) from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result. If On!’s growth follows historical and grows near 60% CAGR it will account for more than 75% of the company's oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20% of Altria’s total revenue in 2029 (versus a negligible 3% total total volume in 2024). Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. The market has overlooked on! as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altria's earning reports, guidance, and financials, but it doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altria's portfolio the market is going to **re-rate** the stock. [DCF]( Altria Group (MO) has a significant moat in the US cig market (45.8% of US Cigarette Market, 59.3% of US Premium Cigarette Market, 37.5% of US Smokeless Tobacco Market), but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever. And Altria's revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent. Cigs' share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60% in 2024 down from 90% in 2000. Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets (Altria operates only in the US in which \\~19% of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs \\~25% of Europeans 15 or olders). Altria's US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver (they sold IQOS system to PMI -> IQOS is the future of vapes) is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers. But Altria does have a growth driver, on! Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50% 2020-2024. on! currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70%. Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28%-50% through 2034 ($250B+ Market). on! trails behind Zyn but still controls 30% market share in a near duopolistic environment. The market (and even Altria itself) is completely ignoring on! because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altria's portfolio. on!’s numbers are buried in Altria’s financials and earnings reports, combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “pouches” segment; on! doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. In 2024 on! was only 20% of Altria’s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4% of revenue. If on!’s historical growth rate of 60% continues through 2029 on! will be 75% of Altria’s oral volume and 25% of total revenue. on!’s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not yet rated by the market. The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock, hoping all the while that the bleeding stops. Except not really. You're more than compensated for your time here. Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy (78.6% Payout). The company has committed up to $2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026, $1.3 billion remaining authorized. So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities. And despite falling revenues, margins continue to grow with no sight of slowing down. Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model, and as pouches scale, margins will widen there as well. In fact, the more we look at revenues broadly, the more it looks over played. Not only do they grow margins at every mark, if we excise tax is taken out from COGS, it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner. + if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood. The market sees this well observed declining trend (declining consumption of tobacco products) and views it as baked in and linear. They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed. But this is not the case. It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow. The bottom of the sentiment is in. Joe rogan says cigs are good for you. Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you. Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life. The evil tobacco barons of old couldn't have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke. The product is being authentically re-marketed to younger generations. & pouches growth is a manifestation of this. Pouches are not eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend, instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential. This implies significant customer acquisition to newer, non smoking, younger consumers. The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new, but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs. Some % (like 1 in 5) of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers, and in the US Altria controls 50% of the cig market, so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability, will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years. Regardless, the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US, indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced. I did a DCF which I've linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $78 with a MOS of 35%. I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions (bull v bear, see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on!). The DCF only affirmed the thesis. The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria’s product lines except on! fck it i just posted one of the DCFs (base case) cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go. Basically the DD shows **BUY** & hold Altria (MO) for 5 Years or until market re-rates the stock as on! becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria’s US cigarette moat.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Altria is a deep value buy . The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood . The market doesnt see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers largely young non smokers from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result . If On ’ s growth follows historical and grows near 60 % CAGR it will account for more than 75 % of the companys oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20 % of Altria ’ s total revenue in 2029 versus a negligible 3 % total total volume in 2024 . Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . The market has overlooked on as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altrias earning reports guidance and financials but it doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altrias portfolio the market is going to rerate the stock . DCF Altria Group MO has a significant moat in the US cig market 45.8 % of US Cigarette Market 59.3 % of US Premium Cigarette Market 37.5 % of US Smokeless Tobacco Market but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever . And Altrias revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent . Cigs share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60 % in 2024 down from 90 % in 2000 . Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets Altria operates only in the US in which 19 % of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs 25 % of Europeans 15 or olders . Altrias US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver they sold IQOS system to PMI IQOS is the future of vapes is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers . But Altria does have a growth driver on Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50 % 20202024. on currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70 % . Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28 % 50 % through 2034 $ 250B Market . on trails behind Zyn but still controls 30 % market share in a near duopolistic environment . The market and even Altria itself is completely ignoring on because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altrias portfolio . on ’ s numbers are buried in Altria ’ s financials and earnings reports combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “ pouches ” segment on doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . In 2024 on was only 20 % of Altria ’ s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4 % of revenue . If on ’ s historical growth rate of 60 % continues through 2029 on will be 75 % of Altria ’ s oral volume and 25 % of total revenue . on ’ s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not_yet rated by the market . The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock hoping all the while that the bleeding stops . Except not_really . Youre more than compensated for your time here . Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy 78.6 % Payout . The company has committed up to $ 2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026 $ 1.3 billion remaining authorized . So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities . And despite falling revenues margins continue to grow with no_sight of slowing down . Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model and as pouches scale margins will widen there as well . In fact the more we look at revenues broadly the more it looks over played . Not_only do they grow margins at every mark if we excise tax is taken out from COGS it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner . if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood . The market sees this well observed declining trend declining consumption of tobacco products and views it as baked in and linear . They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed . But this is not_the case . It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow . The bottom of the sentiment is in . Joe rogan says cigs are good for you . Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you . Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life . The evil tobacco barons of old couldnt have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke . The product is being authentically remarketed to younger generations . pouches growth is a manifestation of this . Pouches are not_eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential . This implies significant customer acquisition to newer non smoking younger consumers . The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs . Some % like 1 in 5 of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers and in the US Altria controls 50 % of the cig market so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years . Regardless the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced . I did a DCF which Ive linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $ 78 with a MOS of 35 % . I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions bull v bear see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on . The DCF only affirmed the thesis . The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria ’ s product lines except on fck it i just posted one of the DCFs base case cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go . Basically the DD shows BUY hold Altria MO for 5 Years or until market rerates the stock as on becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria ’ s US cigarette moat .

      "selftext": "Alright regards, quick thesis because attention spans here are shorter than a 0DTE lifespan. I’m buying TSLA $700 LEAPS Jan 2027. Not because of cars. Not because of deliveries. Because you’re all still valuing Tesla like it’s an auto OEM while Elon is building compute infrastructure for the planet and beyond it. The Actual Play: Compute, Power, Space Everyone’s arguing PE ratios while Elon is on X talking about compute constraints being the real bottleneck for AI. Now connect the dots: xAI needs absurd amounts of compute Tesla builds AI, chips (Dojo), power systems, cooling, energy storage SpaceX owns launch + Starlink (global low-latency data backbone) What do you get? Datacenters in space / near-space No land constraints Solar power abundance Global latency via Starlink Energy storage via Tesla Megapacks AI training + inference at planetary scale This isn’t sci-fi. Elon has explicitly said power + compute are the limiting factors for AI — and he controls both. Why Tesla Is the Trojan Horse Tesla isn’t the product. Tesla is the industrial base: Energy generation Energy storage AI hardware Robotics to build and maintain it Try slapping a PE ratio on that. I’ll wait. Risk? Yeah, TSLA could easily nuke 50% in 6 months. That’s why: LEAPS shares TL;DR You’re trading a car company I’m betting on orbital compute infrastructure Same story as always: sounds insane → works → too late",

Not_because of deliveries . Because you ’ re all still valuing Tesla like it ’ s an auto OEM while Elon is building compute infrastructure for the planet and beyond it . The Actual Play Compute Power Space Everyone ’ s arguing PE ratios while Elon is on X talking about compute constraints being the real bottleneck for AI . Now connect the dots xAI needs absurd amounts of compute Tesla builds AI chips Dojo power systems cooling energy storage SpaceX owns launch Starlink global lowlatency data backbone What do you get Datacenters in space nearspace No_land constraints Solar power abundance Global latency via Starlink Energy storage via Tesla Megapacks AI training inference at planetary scale This isn ’ t scifi . Elon has explicitly said power compute are the limiting factors for AI — and he controls both . Why Tesla Is the Trojan Horse Tesla isn ’ t the product . Tesla is the industrial base Energy generation Energy storage AI hardware Robotics to build and maintain it Try slapping a PE ratio on that . I ’ ll wait .

      "title": "DD: McDonald's MCD - Burger Joint Is About to Print Money",
      "selftext": "**TLDR**: McDonald's isn't a fast-food company. It's a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers. With 185 million loyalty users, an AI-powered digital transformation, a plan to add 10,000 restaurants by 2027, and 82% operating margins on franchise income, this \"boring boomer stock\" is about to break out. Stock is trading at $316 near all-time highs and analysts have a $335 target. I think $400+ is in play by end of 2026. \"We Are Not in the Food Business\" Listen up, you degenerate casino patrons. I know what you're thinking - \"MCD? Really? My grandma owns that stock.\" Well guess what? Your grandma is smarter than you, and she's been collecting 2.24% dividends while you've been bag-holding whatever garbage stock some Discord \"guru\" told you to buy. But here's what most people don't understand about McDonald's. Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said: \"We are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.\" That's right. McDonald's is essentially a $42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism. The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps. The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued: The Real Estate Empire McDonald's owns ~45% of the land and ~70% of the buildings where its 43,000+ restaurants operate $42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93% of restaurants are franchised - meaning McDonald's just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4% royalties PLUS 8-15% of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue: 82% (compared to ~16% on company-operated stores) Let that sink in. When you buy a Big Mac, most of that profit doesn't come from the beef patty - it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonald's. They've turned fast food into a landlord simulator. 2024-2025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue: $7.078 billion (+3% YoY) Global comparable sales: +3.6% Systemwide sales: $131 billion across 43,000+ locations in 115 markets Market cap: ~$226 billion P/E ratio: 27 Dividend yield: 2.24% (they just raised it 6% in Q3 2024) Free cash flow machine - they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody Is Talking About: \"Digitizing the Arches\" Here's where it gets spicy. McDonald's isn't just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks. They're in the middle of a \"once-in-a-generation\" digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers: AI and Technology Deployment McDonald's partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out: Restaurant Platform Edge - Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling real-time AI and IoT. Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations. AI-Powered Accuracy Scales - Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave. Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets. Virtual AI Manager - Introduced January 2025. This thing schedules crews, audits food safety, handles predictive maintenance, and basically runs the restaurant. Drive-Thru AI - Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time, 10% more car throughput, and $65,000 additional annual revenue per store. Do the math: If they roll this out to even 20,000 locations, that's $1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drive-thrus. The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90-day active users (as of Q2 2025) Target: 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before That's a 147% increase in visits. They're not just selling burgers - they're building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies. And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat+ subscriptions. This isn't your grandfather's fast food chain. The Expansion Play: 50,000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonald's is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history: Opening ~2,200 new restaurants in 2025 Target: 50,000 total restaurants by end of 2027 (up from 43,000 today) 1,000 new stores in China alone in 2025 That's adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant = more rent, more royalties, more data for the AI systems. Why \"Boring\" = Tendies MCD has a beta of 0.52. That means when the market crashes, this thing barely moves. When your options portfolio is down 80%, McDonald's will be sitting there like a rock, paying dividends. Institutional ownership sits around 70-75% of shares DCFmodeling.com",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR McDonalds isnt a fastfood company . Its a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers . With 185 million loyalty users an AIpowered digital transformation a plan to add 10000 restaurants by 2027 and 82 % operating margins on franchise income this boring boomer stock is about to break out . Stock is trading at $ 316 near alltime highs and analysts have a $ 335 target . I think $ 400 is in play by end of 2026 . We Are Not_in the Food Business Listen up you degenerate casino patrons . I know what youre thinking MCD Really My grandma owns that stock . Well guess what Your grandma is smarter than you and shes been collecting 2.24 % dividends while youve been bagholding whatever garbage stock some Discord guru told you to buy . But heres what most people dont understand about McDonalds . Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said We are not_technically in the food business . We are in the real estate business . The only reason we sell fifteencent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent . Thats right . McDonalds is essentially a $ 42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism . The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps . The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued The Real Estate Empire McDonalds owns 45 % of the land and 70 % of the buildings where its 43000 restaurants operate $ 42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93 % of restaurants are franchised meaning McDonalds just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4 % royalties PLUS 815 % of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue 82 % compared to 16 % on companyoperated stores Let that sink in . When you buy a Big Mac most of that profit doesnt come from the beef patty it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonalds . Theyve turned fast food into a landlord simulator . 20242025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue $ 7.078 billion 3 % YoY Global comparable sales 3.6 % Systemwide sales $ 131 billion across 43000 locations in 115 markets Market cap $ 226 billion PE ratio 27 Dividend yield 2.24 % they just raised it 6 % in Q3 2024 Free cash flow machine they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody_Is Talking About Digitizing the Arches Heres where it gets spicy . McDonalds isnt just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks . Theyre in the middle of a onceinageneration digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers AI and Technology Deployment McDonalds partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out Restaurant Platform Edge Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling realtime AI and IoT . Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations . AIPowered Accuracy Scales Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave . Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets . Virtual AI Manager Introduced January 2025 . This thing schedules crews audits food safety handles predictive maintenance and basically runs the restaurant . DriveThru AI Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time 10 % more car throughput and $ 65000 additional annual revenue per store . Do the math If they roll this out to even 20000 locations thats $ 1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drivethrus . The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90day active users as of Q2 2025 Target 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before Thats a 147 % increase in visits . Theyre not_just selling burgers theyre building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies . And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat subscriptions . This isnt your grandfathers fast food chain . The Expansion Play 50000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonalds is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history Opening 2200 new restaurants in 2025 Target 50000 total restaurants by end of 2027 up from 43000 today 1000 new stores in China alone in 2025 Thats adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant more rent more royalties more data for the AI systems . Why Boring Tendies MCD has a beta of 0.52 . That means when the market crashes this thing barely moves . When your options portfolio is down 80 % McDonalds will be sitting there like a rock paying dividends . Institutional ownership sits around 7075 % of shares DCFmodeling.com"

Nevertheless was still able to salvage 35k (which is more than I had a week ago tbf) so hopefully enough to make a nice comeback. But still fuck me…",

      "selftext": "With many companies seemingly IPO’ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit, does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins? How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced? In cases like HOOD or Figma, many felt the valuation was too stretched, meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that’s what happened somewhat with HOOD. Do most of you focus on peer multiples, revenue growth, margins, and long-term TAM when deciding to participate? Given that, do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects -like Medline -offers a better risk-reward at entry? What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry? Taking examples of upcoming IPO’s like SpaceX - slightly overvalued, Stripe, data-bricks, Anduril (don’t know about them) but medline looks kinda good but don’t know if it would be multi-bagger. So, throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn’t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO’s. Let’s win together. Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together. TIA.",

      "selftext_processed": "With many companies seemingly IPO ’ ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced In cases like HOOD or Figma many felt the valuation was too stretched meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that ’ s what happened somewhat with HOOD . Do most of you focus on peer multiples revenue growth margins and longterm TAM when deciding to participate Given that do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects like Medline offers a better riskreward at entry What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry Taking examples of upcoming IPO ’ s like SpaceX slightly overvalued Stripe databricks Anduril don ’ t know about them but medline looks kinda good but don ’ t know if it would be multibagger . So throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn ’ t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO ’ s . Let ’ s win together . Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together .

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** **My take: MSTR doesn’t survive more than \\~3 years in most realistic scenarios.** BTC down → MSTR dies fast. BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends + interest. BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working. Different paths, same ending. Longer version for anyone who still has attention span: I’ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don’t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane, volatile bull runs forever *and* the market keeps clapping while getting diluted. At this point MSTR isn’t a software company. It’s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on. The stock trades like BTC on steroids. That’s great when BTC is ripping. It’s terrible when time passes. Here’s the part people gloss over: MSTR has real cash bills. Preferred dividends. Interest. Normal company expenses. Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash. The software business doesn’t cover it. So the whole strategy boils down to two options: * keep issuing stock * or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns. That premium is the entire engine. Once it shrinks, dilution stops being “genius capital markets strategy” and starts being “why am I getting wrecked every quarter.” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value. That’s the model coughing. Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk. I think boring Bitcoin is worse. If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two, volatility dries up, hype fades, and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash. Cash reserves buy time, not survival. And here’s the ironic part: if Bitcoin actually *wins* and becomes mainstream, I still don’t think MSTR wins. In that world, people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly. No dilution. No debt. No CEO risk. MSTR goes from “unique BTC proxy” to “why would I own this instead of IBIT?” So take your pick: * BTC crashes → MSTR blows up * BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out * BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering face-ripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely. That’s not a business model, that’s a belief system. Not saying it won’t pump again. It probably will. This thing feeds on volatility and vibes. But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown. That’s my take. Flame away. **Some actual math:** * **Bitcoin held:** \\~**650,000 BTC** (varies slightly with recent buys; order of magnitude matters) * **BTC value (at $90k):** 650,000 × 90,000 ≈ **$58.5B** * **Cash on hand / reserve:** \\~**$1.3–1.5B** (company explicitly set this aside for dividends + debt service) * **Annual preferred dividends:** ≈ **$85–90M per year** (cash, not optional long term) * **Annual interest expense:** Roughly **$200–250M per year** across converts + senior notes * **Total fixed cash burn:** ≈ **$300–340M per year** (before software ops, which are roughly breakeven at best) * **Runway math (flat BTC, no new dilution):** $1.4B ÷ $320M ≈ **4.3 years** * **More realistic runway (assuming some continued buying / volatility):** **\\~2.5–3.5 years** * **Important detail:** * Interest on debt → **cannot be skipped** without default * Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily, but **they accumulate** and make refinancing harder * Software business → does **not** cover these obligations * **Key structural issue:** The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV, issuing stock becomes value-destructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock. * **What forces BTC selling:** Flat BTC + compressed premium + fixed cash burn = **selling BTC becomes rational**, not ideological. Position: Small position, adding slowly. No options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ. Yes, decay sucks — but it’s still the cleanest way for me to play this. ￼​(DD assisted by AI)",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR My take MSTR doesn ’ t survive more than 3 years in most realistic scenarios . BTC down → MSTR dies fast . BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends interest . BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working . Different paths same ending . Longer version for anyone who still has attention span I ’ ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don ’ t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane volatile bull runs forever and the market keeps clapping while getting diluted . At this point MSTR isn ’ t a software company . It ’ s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on . The stock trades like BTC on steroids . That ’ s great when BTC is ripping . It ’ s terrible when time passes . Here ’ s the part people gloss over MSTR has real cash bills . Preferred dividends . Interest . Normal company expenses . Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash . The software business doesn ’ t cover it . So the whole strategy boils down to two options keep issuing stock or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns . That premium is the entire engine . Once it shrinks dilution stops being “ genius capital markets strategy ” and starts being “ why am I getting wrecked every quarter. ” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value . That ’ s the model coughing . Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk . I think boring Bitcoin is worse . If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two volatility dries up hype fades and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash . Cash reserves buy time not_survival . And here ’ s the ironic part if Bitcoin actually wins and becomes mainstream I still don ’ t think MSTR wins . In that world people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly . No_dilution . No_debt . No_CEO risk . MSTR goes from “ unique BTC proxy ” to “ why would I own this instead of IBIT ” So take your pick BTC crashes → MSTR blows up BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering faceripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely . That ’ s not_a business model that ’ s a belief system . Not_saying it won ’ t pump again . It probably will . This thing feeds on volatility and vibes . But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown . That ’ s my take . Flame away . Some actual math Bitcoin held 650000 BTC varies slightly with recent buys order of magnitude matters BTC value at $ 90k 650000 × 90000 ≈ $ 58.5B Cash on hand reserve $ 1.3–1.5B company explicitly set this aside for dividends debt service Annual preferred dividends ≈ $ 85–90M per year cash not_optional long term Annual interest expense Roughly $ 200–250M per year across converts senior notes Total fixed cash burn ≈ $ 300–340M per year before software ops which are roughly breakeven at best Runway math flat BTC no_new dilution $ 1.4B ÷ $ 320M ≈ 4.3 years More realistic runway assuming some continued buying volatility 2.5–3.5 years Important detail Interest on debt → can not be skipped without default Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily but they accumulate and make refinancing harder Software business → does not cover these obligations Key structural issue The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV issuing stock becomes valuedestructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock . What forces BTC selling Flat BTC compressed premium fixed cash burn selling BTC becomes rational not_ideological . Position Small position adding slowly . No_options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ . Yes decay sucks — but it ’ s still the cleanest way for me to play this . ￼​DD assisted by AI"

      "selftext": "Fast casual has taken a dump and Sweetgreen’s been hit the hardest. But the reality is: \\- fast casual continues to gain market share, winner over casual dining ($15 salad made to your liking still beats a $15 salad at a sit down where it’s probably all Sysco with a 20% tip) \\- Sweetgreen just hired an old exec from Chipotle as their DAO to help with margins \\- $230m cash on hand, enough to get through 2+ years at current burn rates, ignoring the fact they’re slowing down new restaurant openings to help with capital spend, and their 10% layoffs this year and sale of Spyce which took 38 engineers off their payroll \\- valuation is way off compared to peers, about 1x sales vs 4x for Cava and Chipotle \\- they now have a 1.2% stake in Wonder, which owns Grubhub and the ghost kitchen space and is going to scale their Infinite Kitchen technology, where sweetgreen retains the license and right to purchase at cost + 5% \\- ask any AI to rank the top 20 fast casual restaurants and which one has the most premium branding, SG is always on top By the way: \\- 25% short interest \\- 95% held by institutions and insiders \\- it’s called “sweetgreen” \\- there’s an invite-only membership called “goat status” where you get various perks and when you pick up you get a black bag instead of a green one \\- every Becky I know loves sweetgreen. If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you’d be rich now \\- if you can’t afford an $15 salad then this isn’t for you. Go buy your $12 value meal \\- no one has ever complained about “sweetgreen shits” like they do with chipotle. Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality. High rollers can absolutely tell DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",

But the reality is fast casual continues to gain market share winner over casual dining $ 15 salad made to your liking still beats a $ 15 salad at a sit down where it ’ s probably all Sysco with a 20 % tip Sweetgreen just hired an old exec from Chipotle as their DAO to help with margins $ 230m cash on hand enough to get through 2 years at current burn rates ignoring the fact they ’ re slowing down new restaurant openings to help with capital spend and their 10 % layoffs this year and sale of Spyce which took 38 engineers off their payroll valuation is way off compared to peers about 1x sales vs 4x for Cava and Chipotle they now have a 1.2 % stake in Wonder which owns Grubhub and the ghost kitchen space and is going to scale their Infinite Kitchen technology where sweetgreen retains the license and right to purchase at cost 5 % ask any AI to rank the top 20 fast casual restaurants and which one has the most premium branding SG is always on top By the way 25 % short interest 95 % held by institutions and insiders it ’ s called “ sweetgreen ” there ’ s an inviteonly membership called “ goat status ” where you get various perks and when you pick up you get a black bag instead of a green one every Becky I know loves sweetgreen . If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you ’ d be rich now if you can ’ t afford an $ 15 salad then this isn ’ t for you . Go buy your $ 12 value meal no_one has ever complained about “ sweetgreen shits ” like they do with chipotle . Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality . High rollers can absolutely tell DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH NOT_FINANCIAL ADVICE ."
