      "selftext": "My first trading account was set up and funded LITERALLY as the '08 financial crisis crash was beginning. I was so excited to trade I literally unloaded all my funds into stocks within a couple of days to weeks. The chart now doesn't look dramatic but you don't know what it's like to watch your portfolio literally melt away to nothing during a real crash. I'm not talking to the 0dte yolo crowd. I'm talking trying to invest for real. And there was no V. It rook a long time to build back up with all the bear markets and Covid in there to just continue the smack downs. When I speak to my dad who was doing the same during the '87 crash it sounds even worse than anything any of us have experienced. I was also watching him and stocks for real during the dotcom bubble bursting. But again look at the chart and it looks like a blip. All crashes are blips in the long run. It's been said a million times but take it from someone who has been there: \\- The most important thing is DO NOT PANIC. You WILL make irrational choices when you let your emotions get out of check. I know. \\-This too shall pass. The market has seen a Great Depression and many recessions and flash crashes and bear markets. They all end. And if they don't then money isn't gonna help where we're all going! \\- It bears repeating to never be fully invested. Never be fully leveraged. Temper your exuberance during the good times so you can add on during the low times. \\- The hardest thing is selling during a bull market and buying during a bear market. Successful traders and the \"big boys\" do this successfully. Retail does not. \\- I hate the term time in market but damn it it's true. But if you're buying quality stocks when the market turns down you will be rewarded eventually. \\- If you aren't buying and you aren't selling then turn it off. If you have decided to ride out the storm with what you have and just want to wait for the recovery then stop staring at the screen for 7 hours a day. Mental health is an important part of successful trading. \\- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems. The world is not ending though people have thought as much stretching back till early civilization. The world is also not some Garden of Eden Shangri-La. Approach the market with that mentality. \\- Investing is for attaining wealth and financial independence. It is not a get rich quick scheme and unfortunately many new traders in the markets see it as an extension of Draft Kings. Be smart. educate yourself. Use the tax shelters available to everyone. Plan for the future because it sure comes much quicker than you expected. This could be the big one and we'll see the Dow back at 30k...TSLA will go to 80...all big tech obliterated. Wall Street burns as the angry villagers descend on it with pitchforks. Lives are ruined. Bread lines instead of new iPhone drop lines. If I had to guess tho we'll be fine....as we always are. Don't freak out especially if you want to have a long career investing. And you should. It's one way the little man can make any money without inheriting millions from a rich family member. And if all else fails... a few 0dte calls on 3x ETFs couldn't hurt...right? Just for funsies?",

      "selftext_processed": "My first trading account was set up and funded LITERALLY as the 08 financial crisis crash was beginning . I was so excited to trade I literally unloaded all my funds into stocks within a couple of days to weeks . The chart now doesnt look dramatic but you dont know what its like to watch your portfolio literally melt away to nothing_during a real crash . Im not_talking to the 0dte yolo crowd . Im talking trying to invest for real . And there was no_V . It rook a long time to build back up with all the bear markets and Covid in there to just continue the smack downs . When I speak to my dad who was doing the same during the 87 crash it sounds even worse than anything any of us have experienced . I was also watching him and stocks for real during the dotcom bubble bursting . But again look at the chart and it looks like a blip . All crashes are blips in the long run . Its been said a million times but take it from someone who has been there The most important thing is DO NOT_PANIC . You WILL make irrational choices when you let your emotions get out of check . I know . This too shall pass . The market has seen a Great Depression and many recessions and flash crashes and bear markets . They all end . And if they dont then money isnt gon na help where were all going It bears repeating to never_be fully invested . Never_be fully leveraged . Temper your exuberance during the good times so you can add on during the low times . The hardest thing is selling during a bull market and buying during a bear market . Successful traders and the big boys do this successfully . Retail does not_ I hate the term time in market but damn it its true . But if youre buying quality stocks when the market turns down you will be rewarded eventually . If you arent buying and you arent selling then turn it off . If you have decided to ride out the storm with what you have and just want to wait for the recovery then stop staring at the screen for 7 hours a day . Mental health is an important part of successful trading . Nothing_is as good or as bad as it seems . The world is not_ending though people have thought as much stretching back till early civilization . The world is also not_some Garden of Eden ShangriLa . Approach the market with that mentality . Investing is for attaining wealth and financial independence . It is not_a get rich quick scheme and unfortunately many new traders in the markets see it as an extension of Draft Kings . Be smart . educate yourself . Use the tax shelters available to everyone . Plan for the future because it sure comes much quicker than you expected . This could be the big one and well see the Dow back at 30k ... TSLA will go to 80 ... all big tech obliterated . Wall Street burns as the angry villagers descend on it with pitchforks . Lives are ruined . Bread lines instead of new iPhone drop lines . If I had to guess tho well be fine .... as we always are . Dont freak out especially if you want to have a long career investing . And you should . Its one way the little man can make any money without inheriting millions from a rich family member . And if all else fails ... a few 0dte calls on 3x ETFs couldnt hurt ... right Just for funsies"

      "selftext": "There has been a lot of news and talks about an AI bubble, and whether or not it is real, the market has priced in the fear and doubts of many. I am wondering how others are making trades, specifically in options. My main portfolio is in theta decay, but I do dabble in event driven trading, hence why I am interested in this particular topic. At the same time I do think there is an AI bubble, and it will reach a point where: \\- More money and more data centres don't equate into increase in revenue because models stop getting better. This is linked to the prevailing understanding that there is an upper ceiling to LLMs \\- The crash will start from pure play AI startup who are living in debt and unable to fulfil loan repayments/meet investment demands which will likely cause a shift in where investors want to place their money. \\- The crash is likely to expand to consumer AI platforms, and then to chipmakers and data centres in which case a bailout from the government would be necessary in order to mitigate the full effects of the crash. As such, I don't think hyperscalers like Google or Amazon will crazily affected, there will be dents but they will recover. I believe the same for NVDA, that the crash will act like some form of market correction, but it will survive, and continue on. I think some of the best options play would therefore be in companies that are playing the middleman like coreweave. I welcome discourse.

I am wondering how others are making trades specifically in options . My main portfolio is in theta decay but I do dabble in event driven trading hence why I am interested in this particular topic . At the same time I do think there is an AI bubble and it will reach a point where More money and more data centres dont equate into increase in revenue because models stop getting better . This is linked to the prevailing understanding that there is an upper ceiling to LLMs The crash will start from pure play AI startup who are living in debt and unable to fulfil loan repaymentsmeet investment demands which will likely cause a shift in where investors want to place their money . The crash is likely to expand to consumer AI platforms and then to chipmakers and data centres in which case a bailout from the government would be necessary in order to mitigate the full effects of the crash . As such I dont think hyperscalers like Google or Amazon will crazily affected there will be dents but they will recover . I believe the same for NVDA that the crash will act like some form of market correction but it will survive and continue on . I think some of the best options play would therefore be in companies that are playing the middleman like coreweave . I welcome discourse . Feel free to disagree but share and justify why you disagree ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I had always invested in FZROX in my HSA account, this is the account I set up when I left my last job back in 2023. I had \\~34k in it before the current slide, it’s now around 31k. I probably don’t need this money for a while since husband is putting in company HSA account for immediate expenses and he also has about 33k of invested HSA. Few days before the MSFT earning, I sold around 25k worth of FZROX, I invested 9k in FSPGX, some in FSELX the next day. I have about 11k uninvested. My plan was to invest in more aggressive funds, thus the sell. Within few days market has changed a lot. So my question is: do you think it makes sense to add some individual stocks? I don’t want to be rash and invest in speculative stocks. I am really considering some software stocks that are already mainstream but have gone down a lot. Sofi, Pltr, Msft, Rddt, Amazon, lam research. I don’t have much, but want to spread the 11k among few stocks. Do you think it is a good idea? Anyone who has done this, have you regretted? Any stock you think would be great in the list? please no speculative stocks. TIA!",

And in addition every article seems to call it a 1.5 billion dollar acquisition, but they are also creating over 4 million new shares so it ends up being closer to a 3 billion dollar purchase at their current price and diluting their current share holders by 16% Ik they had an earnings beat, but seems over bought and they’re going full hopium on data center buildout to keep its current pace for years. Regulatory wise they are gonna argue it’s not a direct competitor due to the MEMS vs quartz difference, and monopolies don’t exist anymore anyways, so probably no issue there. Their earnings were literally the same for 2022, both years around 82-83 million, yet at its peak it was $100 less back then. The dollar is weaker than it was, but not 33% weaker This deal won’t even go through till EOY 2026 at the soonest according to them. Also Renesas says this is for them to focus on their “core business” of making chips, and a certain penny stock going to ruin (dog speed) probably had them looking for cash, but if their timing business is set to generate $300 million at a 70% margins, and its growth prospects are as strong as SiTime claims, why would they sell it. Renesas had a net loss this year of $347 million, and then they sell a division that will do $210 million in profit next year. Probably cause SiTime is over paying for it And take a look at the insider transactions, literally all selling Anyways idk I bought $400 3/20 puts",

Regulatory wise they are gon na argue it ’ s not_a direct competitor due to the MEMS vs quartz difference and monopolies don ’ t exist anymore anyways so probably no_issue there . Their earnings were literally the same for 2022 both years around 8283 million yet at its peak it was $ 100 less back then . The dollar is weaker than it was but not_33 % weaker This deal won ’ t even go through till EOY 2026 at the soonest according to them . Also Renesas says this is for them to focus on their “ core business ” of making chips and a certain penny stock going to ruin dog speed probably had them looking for cash but if their timing business is set to generate $ 300 million at a 70 % margins and its growth prospects are as strong as SiTime claims why would they sell it . Renesas had a net loss this year of $ 347 million and then they sell a division that will do $ 210 million in profit next year . Probably cause SiTime is over paying for it And take a look at the insider transactions literally all selling Anyways idk I bought $ 400 320 puts"

      "selftext": "Carvana (CVNA) is an internet based automotive retail company that has been knocked 22% off its lofty January heights, but remains tremendously overvalued compared to its segment competitors (Carmax, Autonation, Lithia). Carvana also came under fire last month after a short seller report by Gotham City Capital questioning their sub-prime lending and accounting practices. Now CVNA has given off a strongly Bearish technical signal as it's 20 day EMA crossed its 50 day SMA in what is often called a \"Bear Cross\" or a \"Death Cross.\" (Can I say that here? Do I have to write Unalive Cross?) I am the first to admit that technical analysis is about as accurate as tarot readings or Voodoo magic. However, the last 2 times CVNA's moving averages crossed like they did today the stock fell dramatically over the coming weeks. In March of 2025 CVNA went through a Bear Cross and fell from $220 to $162. In October 2025 CVNA fell from $357 to $285 after a Bear Cross. As of 4pm today (2/5/2026) CVNA traded at a lofty $383 a share, a significant drop off from their $490 peak after inclusion in the S&P500, but still a staggering 78 times their reported annual income. Between geopolitical turmoil, risk-off selling, the recent short seller report, and now this clearly bearish technical signal, it seems highly likely CVNA will continue their precipitous fall. As I have posted before, I have current open put option positions against CVNA and intend to continue to short CVNA stock for the immediate future. I may open or close other positions with no prior notice. Year to date this short trade is up over 34%, and I have no intention of letting off CVNA until their market cap approaches a more appropriate enterprise value. I am not a Financial Advisor. This is not Financial advice. I am a 14 yr automotive veteran and a 15 year stock and options retail trader. Thanks for reading BFLO-Retail [ [ [ [",

      "selftext_processed": "Carvana CVNA is an internet based automotive retail company that has been knocked 22 % off its lofty January heights but remains tremendously overvalued compared to its segment competitors Carmax Autonation Lithia . Carvana also came under fire last month after a short seller report by Gotham City Capital questioning their subprime lending and accounting practices . Now CVNA has given off a strongly Bearish technical signal as its 20 day EMA crossed its 50 day SMA in what is often called a Bear Cross or a Death Cross . Can I say that here Do I have to write Unalive Cross I am the first to admit that technical analysis is about as accurate as tarot readings or Voodoo magic . However the last 2 times CVNAs moving averages crossed like they did today the stock fell dramatically over the coming weeks . In March of 2025 CVNA went through a Bear Cross and fell from $ 220 to $ 162 . In October 2025 CVNA fell from $ 357 to $ 285 after a Bear Cross . As of 4pm today 252026 CVNA traded at a lofty $ 383 a share a significant drop off from their $ 490 peak after inclusion in the SP500 but still a staggering 78 times their reported annual income . Between geopolitical turmoil riskoff selling the recent short seller report and now this clearly bearish technical signal it seems highly likely CVNA will continue their precipitous fall . As I have posted before I have current open put option positions against CVNA and intend to continue to short CVNA stock for the immediate future . I may open or close other positions with no_prior notice . Year to date this short trade is up over 34 % and I have no_intention of letting off CVNA until their market cap approaches a more appropriate enterprise value . I am not_a Financial Advisor . This is not_Financial advice . I am a 14 yr automotive veteran and a 15 year stock and options retail trader . Thanks for reading BFLORetail"

      "title": "I built a portfolio on \"Realpolitik, Futurism & Commodities.\" One week in, and I am down 10%. Is it bad strategy, or is it just bad timing?",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m fairly new to investing in ETFs (started last week lol). No knowledge of economics or finance other than trading crypto. Instead of just dumping everything into VOO and chilling, I decided to do some \"brainstorming\" with Gemini. I described my vision, and it helped me pick the ETFs. After a few days of browsing the market, I locked-in. Basically, I devised a portfolio strategy based on what I thought were three solid long-term pillars: 1. **Realpolitik:** Betting on specific regions (Poland, Turkey, Korea, \"Ex-China\" Emerging Markets) based on shifting geopolitical blocs. 2. **Futurism:** Betting on the inevitable rise of AI, robotics, space, and nuclear energy. 3. **Commodities:** Hedges against inflation and betting on the raw materials needed for the tech boom (Copper, Uranium, Rare Earths, Silver). My philosophy is simple: The world is changing, and my portfolio is going to reflect exactly that. I divided the portfolio among the rising powers, the tech that will shape our near-future, and the materials that will build that future. **The Result:** While I still think my thinking is not so flawed, my \"mind child\" has had a rough start. Almost every single position is in the red, and my \"inflation hedges\" (Commodities) are actually hitting me the hardest. Here is my portfolio breakdown, organized by my original allocation (bet size) before the losses started piling up: **The \"Safe\" Foundation** * **VEA** (7.3% Alloc | -0.81% Loss): Developed markets (Europe/Pacific). * **VOO** (7.0% Alloc | -3.03% Loss): S&P 500. **Geopolitical Bets** * **EMXC** (14.6% Alloc | -0.66% Loss): Emerging Markets ex-China. * **EWY** (3.7% Alloc | -7.82% Loss): South Korea. * **EPOL** (3.7% Alloc | -3.93% Loss): Poland. * **TUR** (3.6% Alloc | -1.43% Loss): Turkey. **Futuristic Tech & Defense** * **SOXX** (9.1% Alloc | -9.90% Loss): Semiconductors. * **ROKT** (7.6% Alloc | -9.11% Loss): Space & Deep Sea. * **EUAD** (5.5% Alloc | -7.32% Loss): European Aerospace & Defense. * **XBI** (3.6% Alloc | -5.28% Loss): Biotech. * **NUKZ** (2.0% Alloc | -5.07% Loss): Nuclear Energy. * **ARKQ** (1.6% Alloc | -7.83% Loss): Robotics & AI. **Metals & Commodities (The Pain Zone)** * **URA** (11.7% Alloc | -20.15% Loss): Uranium. * **COPX** (6.8% Alloc | -16.45% Loss): Copper Miners. * **SLV** (5.1% Alloc | -36.42% Loss): Silver. * **SPPP** (5.1% Alloc | -25.28% Loss): Platinum/Palladium. * **REMX** (1.8% Alloc | -19.97% Loss): Rare Earth Elements. **My Question to You:** Is my strategy fundamentally flawed, or is this just terrible timing? Especially seeing my high-conviction plays like Uranium and Silver drop 20-30% has been a bad start. * Did I overdiversify into too many niche ETFs? * Is the \"Commodity Supercycle\" thesis dead? * Should I cut my losses on the heavy bleeders (SLV, URA) and consolidate into the broad market, or is this exactly the time I should be buying more if I believe in the thesis? Any honest feedback is appreciated. I will use it to improve my reasoning, and maybe my portfolio. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ m fairly new to investing in ETFs started last week lol . No_knowledge of economics or finance other than trading crypto . Instead of just dumping everything into VOO and chilling I decided to do some brainstorming with Gemini . I described my vision and it helped me pick the ETFs . After a few days of browsing the market I lockedin . Basically I devised a portfolio strategy based on what I thought were three solid longterm pillars 1 . Realpolitik Betting on specific regions Poland Turkey Korea ExChina Emerging Markets based on shifting geopolitical blocs . 2 . Futurism Betting on the inevitable rise of AI robotics space and nuclear energy . 3. Commodities Hedges against inflation and betting on the raw materials needed for the tech boom Copper Uranium Rare Earths Silver . My philosophy is simple The world is changing and my portfolio is going to reflect exactly that . I divided the portfolio among the rising powers the tech that will shape our nearfuture and the materials that will build that future . The Result While I still think my thinking is not_so flawed my mind child has had a rough start . Almost every single position is in the red and my inflation hedges Commodities are actually hitting me the hardest . Here is my portfolio breakdown organized by my original allocation bet size before the losses started piling up The Safe Foundation VEA 7.3 % Alloc 0.81 % Loss Developed markets EuropePacific . VOO 7.0 % Alloc 3.03 % Loss SP 500 . Geopolitical Bets EMXC 14.6 % Alloc 0.66 % Loss Emerging Markets exChina . EWY 3.7 % Alloc 7.82 % Loss South Korea . EPOL 3.7 % Alloc 3.93 % Loss Poland . TUR 3.6 % Alloc 1.43 % Loss Turkey . Futuristic Tech Defense SOXX 9.1 % Alloc 9.90 % Loss Semiconductors . ROKT 7.6 % Alloc 9.11 % Loss Space Deep Sea . EUAD 5.5 % Alloc 7.32 % Loss European Aerospace Defense . XBI 3.6 % Alloc 5.28 % Loss Biotech . NUKZ 2.0 % Alloc 5.07 % Loss Nuclear Energy . ARKQ 1.6 % Alloc 7.83 % Loss Robotics AI . Metals Commodities The Pain Zone URA 11.7 % Alloc 20.15 % Loss Uranium . COPX 6.8 % Alloc 16.45 % Loss Copper Miners . SLV 5.1 % Alloc 36.42 % Loss Silver . SPPP 5.1 % Alloc 25.28 % Loss PlatinumPalladium . REMX 1.8 % Alloc 19.97 % Loss Rare Earth Elements . My Question to You Is my strategy fundamentally flawed or is this just terrible timing Especially seeing my highconviction plays like Uranium and Silver drop 2030 % has been a bad start . Did I overdiversify into too many niche ETFs Is the Commodity Supercycle thesis dead Should I cut my losses on the heavy bleeders SLV URA and consolidate into the broad market or is this exactly the time I should be buying more if I believe in the thesis Any honest feedback is appreciated . I will use it to improve my reasoning and maybe my portfolio . Thanks"

Barring Africa and parts of Asia almost every country in the world including India and China have less than 2.1 TFR rate. If we count in the fact that developing countries are not using oil as much as today’s developed countries did during their development the effect is even more profound. Pakistan for instance with a per capita much lower than US now has a widespread solar adoption because oil energy is more expensive than solar energy. Also, I won’t even talk about all the new supply coming online pushing the oil prices lower from guayana and potentially from Venezuela, Iran and Russia. That’s too unpredictable.",

My reason was \\*China and the USA /big Business doesn’t want to pay 6x the price for metals forever. My reasoning isn’t complicated but I do have a hypothesis Hypothesis- Trump passes the big beautiful bill, in that bill most big companies are going to receive a major refund of roughly 33percent of whatever they paid. I believe companies are possibly tanking shares to repurchase their own shares a significant discounts. They may then use those shares to rally their stock prices significantly creating positive momentum. This could be wildly wrong however it makes since…. We did need a pullback and it is healthy for stocks,especially speculative stocks and leveraged positions getting out of control. Cheers and remember it is simply a choice you make every day to give attention to stock prices and position. You’d likely preform better under discipled monthly or weekly buys/ I took a position in CRM and CSU which are software stocks. They already have an incredible margin of safety that makes me feel comfortable they’re easily climb back those bought prices. I’m also DCA into them, I highly recommend you not panic sell. Have a watchlist and wait for the margin of safety.",

      "selftext_processed": "Let me preface I made a post talking about Silver and Gold and how they were going to dump 16 days ago . My reason was China and the USA big Business doesn ’ t want to pay 6x the price for metals forever . My reasoning isn ’ t complicated but I do have a hypothesis Hypothesis Trump passes the big beautiful bill in that bill most big companies are going to receive a major refund of roughly 33percent of whatever they paid . I believe companies are possibly tanking shares to repurchase their own shares a significant discounts . They may then use those shares to rally their stock prices significantly creating positive momentum . This could be wildly wrong however it makes since… . We did need a pullback and it is healthy for stocksespecially speculative stocks and leveraged positions getting out of control . Cheers and remember it is simply a choice you make every day to give attention to stock prices and position . You ’ d likely preform better under discipled monthly or weekly buys I took a position in CRM and CSU which are software stocks . They already have an incredible margin of safety that makes me feel comfortable they ’ re easily climb back those bought prices . I ’ m also DCA into them I highly recommend you not_panic sell . Have a watchlist and wait for the margin of safety ."

      "selftext": "I've been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me. I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears, comments about AI being useless, and others saying its revolutionary. **The Fears:** **Seat Compression:** Less licenses, less money. **Commoditization of Code:** Code is cheap, \"Lowering the MOAT\". **Economic Displacement**: White collar jobs are replaced by software. **Types of SaaS:** Systems of Engagement - DOCU, ZM Systems of Record - CRM, NOW WKDY Cybersecurity - PANW, CRWD, NET, ZS Infrastructure & Data - SNOW, DDOG, MGDB Specialty - SNPS, CDNS, SAP, CSU, VEEV, INTU DevOps - TEAM, GTLB Hyper Scalars: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft (All down like 20% +) **My thoughts:** I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard. My wife has a small business and for payroll there aren't a lot of great options outside of intuit. **Commoditization of code**: was what I found to be the most prevalent \"disruptor\" to Intuit. For example, if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts, and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit. There is also some fear of an AI advisor, but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best. While I was working through this case study with Gemini, it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk. It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and aren't going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company. If giants won't enter this space what about the small guys? A small scrappy start up? Does AI make VC money so much more efficient that they can bust into highly established business processes or highly regulated markets? Are they so much more efficient now, that the business's weren't worth pursuing before? What is that multiple? A team of developers needs to be 10-15x more efficient so 100M stretches to 500M in salary output of the past? Are you going to outcompete the established teams with moats of money? You are always going to have overhead with these startups, cloud hosting, security, snow, ddog, you name it. Half of these **\"seat compressions\"** will be filled with the competitors trying to disrupt the kings. AI hasn't \"changed software\", it still does the same thing. Startups don't have some implied advantage because the game has changed. They can just work faster now like everyone else. There are some fun inferences you can make with AI and the logic you can build around it but functionally the results are the same. One last thing. The earnings reports have all been pretty incredible. Google's CEO during his earnings call even reiterated bullishness on SaaS companies. If this were structural I would be more concerned, but the capex spend is reinforcing the narrative software is growing. The chip companies are still falling despite record spend. I have DCA'd half of my assets into software names over the last 3 days. I will continue to add the rest over the next week or two as things shake out. I am spread across most of the names. The safest bets for those who are risk adverse are SNPS, CDNS (duopoly in chip software/analysis/QA) and Cyber Security as vibe coders deploy exploits i guess? Do your own research and be patient.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me . I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears comments about AI being useless and others saying its revolutionary . The Fears Seat Compression Less licenses less money . Commoditization of Code Code is cheap Lowering the MOAT . Economic Displacement White collar jobs are replaced by software . Types of SaaS Systems of Engagement DOCU ZM Systems of Record CRM NOW WKDY Cybersecurity PANW CRWD NET ZS Infrastructure Data SNOW DDOG MGDB Specialty SNPS CDNS SAP CSU VEEV INTU DevOps TEAM GTLB Hyper Scalars Google Meta Amazon Microsoft All down like 20 % My thoughts I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard . My wife has a small business and for payroll there arent a lot of great options outside of intuit . Commoditization of code was what I found to be the most prevalent disruptor to Intuit . For example if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit . There is also some fear of an AI advisor but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best . While I was working through this case study with Gemini it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk . It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years . Google Amazon Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and arent going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company . If giants wont enter this space what about the small guys A small scrappy start up Does AI make VC money so much more efficient that they can bust into highly established business processes or highly regulated markets Are they so much more efficient now that the businesss werent worth pursuing before What is that multiple A team of developers needs to be 1015x more efficient so 100M stretches to 500M in salary output of the past Are you going to outcompete the established teams with moats of money You are always going to have overhead with these startups cloud hosting security snow ddog you name it . Half of these seat compressions will be filled with the competitors trying to disrupt the kings . AI hasnt changed software it still does the same thing . Startups dont have some implied advantage because the game has changed . They can just work faster now like everyone else . There are some fun inferences you can make with AI and the logic you can build around it but functionally the results are the same . One last thing . The earnings reports have all been pretty incredible . Googles CEO during his earnings call even reiterated bullishness on SaaS companies . If this were structural I would be more concerned but the capex spend is reinforcing the narrative software is growing . The chip companies are still falling despite record spend . I have DCAd half of my assets into software names over the last 3 days . I will continue to add the rest over the next week or two as things shake out . I am spread across most of the names . The safest bets for those who are risk adverse are SNPS CDNS duopoly in chip softwareanalysisQA and Cyber Security as vibe coders deploy exploits i guess Do your own research and be patient ."

I understand the Capex fears and ties to OpenAI but this company isn't going anywhere soon and there's no market substitute to its products; not just at retail but more so at the enterprise level. Even if OpenAI fails, msft has broad IP and api rights till 2032. Personally, I like the stock at 22PE and almost at liberation day prices but with quarter over quarter growth since then. Jan 27 leaps seem decent to me. Maybe META as well as it's back to 650. Curious to hear opinions.",

Even if OpenAI fails msft has broad IP and api rights till 2032 . Personally I like the stock at 22PE and almost at liberation day prices but with quarter over quarter growth since then . Jan 27 leaps seem decent to me . Maybe META as well as its back to 650 . Curious to hear opinions ."

Everyone privileged enough is out looking for something to throw it in for yield and everyone that doesn't have the ability to is stuck holding it.

Total value is **\\~$200B** for **competitive bids today**. Non-competitive for those 2 day totaled **\\~$11B**. Slightly more demand for the US1M than US2M but by $10B.

Total value I don't have the non-competitive figures for the JP bonds unfortunately (still trying to figure that out).

Source: [ What I say below comes with the disclaimer of I am not a Financial Advisor nor am I speculating on the future. Moving forward, the flock to USD should give us some optimism for the US market. Although the Administration speaks of devaluing the USD, it's still a trusted currency. Also, at the very least, given today's picture, it shows that the appreciation brought to you by US T-Bills is more attractive. I can't say who is buying, but we can see that money is moving in that direction.",

Also as of right now USD is up DXY.NYB USDEUR USDJPY USDGBP USDAUD and USDNZD . FOR YOU BOND NUTS PLEASE CORRECT ME HERE For US primary bond inflows what I saw today was that about half of the competitive bids tendered were accepted for US1M and US2M . Total value is $ 200B for competitive bids today . Noncompetitive for those 2 day totaled $ 11B . Slightly more demand for the US1M than US2M but by $ 10B . That said the total value of the the US1M and US2M purchases today were $ 211B . Source For JP primary bond inflows of those tendered competitively for JP30Y today only 14 of those were accepted . For JP10Y 13 was accepted . Total value I dont have the noncompetitive figures for the JP bonds unfortunately still trying to figure that out . The total value of JP10Y and JP30Y purchases today were ¥2.5T or $ 16B . Source In advance I apologize for denoting these incorrectly . For EU primary bond inflows the total value of the EU2M EU1M and EU1Y purchases today were €3B or $ 3.5B . Source What I say below comes with the disclaimer of I am not_a Financial Advisor nor am I speculating on the future . Moving forward the flock to USD should give us some optimism for the US market . Although the Administration speaks of devaluing the USD its still a trusted currency . Also at the very least given todays picture it shows that the appreciation brought to you by US TBills is more attractive . I cant say who is buying but we can see that money is moving in that direction ."

      "selftext": "Hey all! I started trading about 3 weeks ago. I put about a month's pay into a trading account, as I felt confident that even if I lost it all, I could still make it back with relative ease. I was feeling good about it when after a few lucky trades I was up 10%, but then this week happened. I got caught up in online discussion and put about 75% of my money in IREN. I bought around 51$ and sold at 57$ - **but the line kept going up.** This is where I got scared and got back in, exactly when I shouldn't have. We all know what happened since. Now, in such a case, is it wiser to cut your losses and head for the hills or is waiting out a viable option? There's never a guarantee for a bounceback, but also there's no guarantee that I could make back such a loss step by step, trade by trade. I know this answer varies from one stock to another, but **I'm just curious to hear any kind of input from more experienced traders out there**. What are your thoughts on the matter?",

I put about a months pay into a trading account as I felt confident that even if I lost it all I could still make it back with relative ease . I was feeling good about it when after a few lucky trades I was up 10 % but then this week happened . I got caught up in online discussion and put about 75 % of my money in IREN . I bought around 51 $ and sold at 57 $ but the line kept going up . This is where I got scared and got back in exactly when I shouldnt have . We all know what happened since . Now in such a case is it wiser to cut your losses and head for the hills or is waiting out a viable option Theres never_a guarantee for a bounceback but also theres no_guarantee that I could make back such a loss step by step trade by trade . I know this answer varies from one stock to another but Im just curious to hear any kind of input from more experienced traders out there . What are your thoughts on the matter"

For everyone else: just look at the charts. Any time software is this far off its ATH, it rips back up. I ran the numbers in Excel for the IGV, and the average 12-month return for IGV after it's down -32% (which is where it's at now) is +22%--if you exclude the dot-com and great financial crisis, which I'm assuming is not happening. If you look at MSFT specifically, this is basically the lowest PE you will ever get on MSFT outside a GFC-level event. I know the charts look pretty scary, but you have to be greedy when others are fearful. I bought some MSFT, CRM, FISV and LULU, and sold puts on BUG and IGV to get in a bit lower. And if this is a dot-com or GFC level event, everyone except the most extreme bearish positions will be fucked anyway, so don't panic.",

I ran the numbers in Excel for the IGV and the average 12month return for IGV after its down 32 % which is where its at now is 22 % if you exclude the dotcom and great financial crisis which Im assuming is not_happening . If you look at MSFT specifically this is basically the lowest PE you will ever get on MSFT outside a GFClevel event . I know the charts look pretty scary but you have to be greedy when others are fearful . I bought some MSFT CRM FISV and LULU and sold puts on BUG and IGV to get in a bit lower . And if this is a dotcom or GFC level event everyone except the most extreme bearish positions will be fucked anyway so dont panic ."

It lasted all of about 6 weeks before they came back to the table with a \"I'll see you and raise you\" number on how much they were gonna sink into infrastructure. But that's nothing compared to what we're now seeing. * META: $115b - $135b (easy to see how given it keeps offering a billion dollars to anyone with good credentials from a previous AI startup to come join them) * MSFT: on track for $150b (annualised) * GOOG: $175b - $185b (double last year) * AMZN: $200b (up from $135b) Some handy context I went back and found too. Google's ENTIRE capex spend in 2020: $22b. Outlier low? Nope: 2021: $25b. It's hasn't doubled its spending. Or quadrupled it. No, it's increased it by a factor of about 8x.

But thats nothing_compared to what were now seeing . META $ 115b $ 135b easy to see how given it keeps offering a billion dollars to anyone with good credentials from a previous AI startup to come join them MSFT on track for $ 150b annualised GOOG $ 175b $ 185b double last year AMZN $ 200b up from $ 135b Some handy context I went back and found too . Googles ENTIRE capex spend in 2020 $ 22b . Outlier low Nope 2021 $ 25b . Its hasnt doubled its spending . Or quadrupled it . No_its increased it by a factor of about 8x .

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, My knowledge of investing is very limited and I'm humbly asking for some insight or help with a stock I purchased in December of 2023. Also, I know chase is terrible for a self directed account, I plan on moving everything to a different bank soon. In Dec 2023, I bought 108 Shares of SAVE (Spirit Airlines) stock for $15.16 a share, for a total of $1637.27. I bought these shares thinking the Spirit Airlines and JetBlue merger was going to be approved. Needless to say, it was not approved and the SAVE stock immediately tanked. I didn't touch the stock after that because I just didn't know what to do with it. Fast forward to Nov 2024, Spirit files for bankruptcy and the ticket changed from SAVE to SAVEQ per my monthly statements. SAVEQ stays on my monthly statements until Feb 2025 where it last appears with a value of $0.47 a share for a total of $50.76. SAVEQ no longer appears on my March 2025 statement. Full disclosure, I asked chatGPT how to handle this for my 2025 taxes and it said to call chase and make sure the stock is marked as a worthless secuirty and they should provide me with and 1099-B. I called chase and the rep said they could not neither of those things and I just had to work it out with my tax person. Is this true? Should I call and ask again? How should I proceed? Thank you to any guidance anyone can provide.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone My knowledge of investing is very limited and Im humbly asking for some insight or help with a stock I purchased in December of 2023 . Also I know chase is terrible for a self directed account I plan on moving everything to a different bank soon . In Dec 2023 I bought 108 Shares of SAVE Spirit Airlines stock for $ 15.16 a share for a total of $ 1637.27 . I bought these shares thinking the Spirit Airlines and JetBlue merger was going to be approved . Needless to say it was not_approved and the SAVE stock immediately tanked . I didnt touch the stock after that because I just didnt know what to do with it . Fast forward to Nov 2024 Spirit files for bankruptcy and the ticket changed from SAVE to SAVEQ per my monthly statements . SAVEQ stays on my monthly statements until Feb 2025 where it last appears with a value of $ 0.47 a share for a total of $ 50.76 . SAVEQ no_longer appears on my March 2025 statement . Full disclosure I asked chatGPT how to handle this for my 2025 taxes and it said to call chase and make sure the stock is marked as a worthless secuirty and they should provide me with and 1099B . I called chase and the rep said they could not_neither of those things and I just had to work it out with my tax person . Is this true Should I call and ask again How should I proceed Thank you to any guidance anyone can provide ."

My gut says the real generational winners will come out of space and robotics, where deep technical moats actually matter and where there might be an NVDA-type story hiding in plain sight. I also think quantum has massive long-term potential (IONQ is interesting), but honestly it still feels like GOOG is the real beast there via infrastructure and talent. My personal bets for future trillion-dollar plays are RKLB and ASTS, but I’m genuinely curious what others see as the next breakout compounding machines. What names are you watching - Future sectors - Drone, Robotics, Space, Human longevity/ Gene Editing, Quantum, Memory plays aka semis, underwater drone/oceans, critical minerals, photonics, Energy - Nuclear aka SMR, Fuel cell, Data centers, renewables, maybe Oil, utilities, Fire watch - BAE. Am I missing any future industries not talked about.",

      "selftext": "I’m surprised the stock is down 11 % today. Earnings did leave the majority of analysts adjusting the price targets downward and I guess the market being down severely is making the stock get extra punished. Earnings weren’t all bad though- you could make a case that they were in fact good and not bad. Overall I would say they were mixed. The number of daily active users increased but they fell 5 % in North America specifically and that’s where their most important users are located- in particular because they are the most valuable ones in that they provide the most profits from advertising. For such a long time - seven years to exact - $7 was the floor for this stock. If it ever went below that price it would get back over it within a few days. The stock is trading incredibly close to its historical all time low of $4.82 which it reached in 2018 and when that happened, it recovered to over $7 in a few weeks. Obviously software and tech stocks are being punished very hard these past few days. Could it be a trend that will keep on going? I doubt it. My guess is we will see a reversal in the next couple of weeks and when that happens, I imagine SNAP will get back over $6. For it to go to $7 again… I don’t know- maybe a few months? I could be very wrong. It’s perfectly possible it will stay lower than $7 for years. If indeed it makes it back to $7 within a few months then that’s 35 % gains from today. Q1 Earnings didn’t leave me thinking SNAP is a dying company. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m surprised the stock is down 11 % today . Earnings did leave the majority of analysts adjusting the price targets downward and I guess the market being down severely is making the stock get extra punished . Earnings weren ’ t all bad though you could make a case that they were in fact good and not_bad . Overall I would say they were mixed . The number of daily active users increased but they fell 5 % in North America specifically and that ’ s where their most important users are located in particular because they are the most valuable ones in that they provide the most profits from advertising . For such a long time seven years to exact $ 7 was the floor for this stock . If it ever went below that price it would get back over it within a few days . The stock is trading incredibly close to its historical all time low of $ 4.82 which it reached in 2018 and when that happened it recovered to over $ 7 in a few weeks . Obviously software and tech stocks are being punished very hard these past few days . Could it be a trend that will keep on going I doubt it . My guess is we will see a reversal in the next couple of weeks and when that happens I imagine SNAP will get back over $ 6 . For it to go to $ 7 again… I don ’ t know maybe a few months I could be very wrong . It ’ s perfectly possible it will stay lower than $ 7 for years . If indeed it makes it back to $ 7 within a few months then that ’ s 35 % gains from today . Q1 Earnings didn ’ t leave me thinking SNAP is a dying company . What do you guys think"

      "selftext": "Are you involuntarily celibate or unable to speak to women? Good. Match Group is the digital custodian of the modern male loneliness epidemic. There’s basically no industry more guaranteed than sex. From the Supreme Gentleman to your average pajeet, people are willing to die for this shit. Match Group has a chokehold on sex, with a 45% market share in dating apps, which are increasingly essential to modern relationships. The era of looksmax, promiscuity, hookups, hedonism, and polyamory has officially started, so how can you hedge your miserable existence? At a 7B valuation, It generated a staggering 1.2 billion dollars in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 and is currently forecasting that number to rise as high as 1.325 billion dollars by the end of 2026. With an EV of 10B, that’s 7x EV/EBITDA. PE is 12X, and P/FCF of 7X. Bargain numbers. So the business is failing right? Management is forecasting flat revenue for 2026. Frankly, even if revenue never grew again, 10B EV for 1.2B of reliable ebitda is undervalued by 30-50%. Revenue isn’t growing because broke boys stopped paying. Payers decreased 5% year over year. However, employed chuds picked up the slack with average amount spent going up 7%, leading to flat revenue. I attribute the current circumstances of MTCH directly to the K shaped economy: dating is a tertiary expense, and when young men are globally broke, one of the first expenses they cut is their dating app perks. *However,* this will eventually reverse. Not only will the K shaped economy slowly recover over time, but younger men will grow into better paying jobs, leading to more disposable income to spend with MTCH. Long 800 shares. TP EV/EBITDA of 10x, share price of \\~50 assuming current fundamentals.",

The era of looksmax promiscuity hookups hedonism and polyamory has officially started so how can you hedge your miserable existence At a 7B valuation It generated a staggering 1.2 billion dollars in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 and is currently forecasting that number to rise as high as 1.325 billion dollars by the end of 2026 . With an EV of 10B that ’ s 7x EVEBITDA . PE is 12X and PFCF of 7X . Bargain numbers . So the business is failing right Management is forecasting flat revenue for 2026 . Frankly even if revenue never_grew again 10B EV for 1.2B of reliable ebitda is undervalued by 3050 % . Revenue isn ’ t growing because broke boys stopped paying . Payers decreased 5 % year over year . However employed chuds picked up the slack with average amount spent going up 7 % leading to flat revenue . I attribute the current circumstances of MTCH directly to the K shaped economy dating is a tertiary expense and when young men are globally broke one of the first expenses they cut is their dating app perks . However this will eventually reverse . Not_only will the K shaped economy slowly recover over time but younger men will grow into better paying jobs leading to more disposable income to spend with MTCH . Long 800 shares .

      "title": "Costco: SOLID Company BUT Expensive Stock. Why? Because Nothing Is Really 'New'",
      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Costco is a best-in-class, recession-resistant business, but nothing has changed enough to justify its current multiple given long-term growth still looks \\~9–10% going forward. **Nothing new.** What Costco Does Right: Costco can take a 34% reduction in merchandise revenue before they move negative. Their weighted average cost of debt is 1.7-1.8% Their Interest income on their **$16Bil cash reserves** exceeds their interest expense on leases and senior notes Membership fee revenues (>90% retention annually) pay for 23% of their fixed costs Proven pricing realization as merchandise costs increase Growing new RMN revenue stream with high profit margins Costco has very good cost control in a bad economy. I say this because of the subtle recession fears that are cropping up in few but notable places. Areas of concern like: job market pessimism, creeping unemployment rates, drop in consumer sentiment and sustained inflation due, in part, to tariffs, although, mostly attributable to monetary expansion. Through it all, Costco has great pricing authority, very few competitors and a deep focus in a sector that they uniquely have a pulse on. I would argue that they have a unique product mix that captures sales volume shift from grocers like \"Whole foods\" and traditional retailer outfits particularly in the apparel space. Costco also has an incredibly diverse consumer base. They can capture sales from small businesses like restauranteurs, convenience stores, high-income and middle-income households. Looking at their revenue performance between 2007 to 2012, you'll see they vaguely experienced any adverse economic consequences in our peak recession years 2008-2010. So what *could* cause Costco to hurt? If they fail to respond to merchandise costs in a timely manner and their pricing doesn't track in times of higher inflation or deflation (less likely), their already thin gross margins can compress further or their revenue (less sensitive) could decline due to slow tracking. **Demographic shifts** can also cause harm. As it is, Costco's growth is unitary and very linear. Adding square footage and store openings are essential for their growth. Growth is directly tied to their stock's performance. This is a small fear as Costco rarely develops into areas where the future is unknown. They look to real estate values, property mix, consumer behaviors tied to those demographics; etc. Any area could experience a population decline, but their growth model hinges tightly to areas with slow drift. **As for their share price**, **you can make an argument for them being extremely expensive compared to their historical P/E ratios. No new developments or clues left by their executives hint at anything vastly innovative to warrant belief that their revenue growth will suddenly break beyond their average of 9-10%.** you can argue their added revenue streams, ecommerce, RMN and so forth, but these have not materially increased the projected future revenue growth above the 9-10% expectation nor are they expected to grow margins to a degree that support the higher share price. So, they are **expensive** based on what we can reasonably price in and the impact on free cash flow to investors. So from a Free cash flow perspective, accounting for new growth assumptions, we can say that their valuation is almost **twice as expensive as what it was**.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Costco is a bestinclass recessionresistant business but nothing_has changed enough to justify its current multiple given longterm growth still looks 9–10 % going forward . Nothing new . What Costco Does Right Costco can take a 34 % reduction in merchandise revenue before they move negative . Their weighted average cost of debt is 1.71.8 % Their Interest income on their $ 16Bil cash reserves exceeds their interest expense on leases and senior notes Membership fee revenues 90 % retention annually pay for 23 % of their fixed costs Proven pricing realization as merchandise costs increase Growing new RMN revenue stream with high profit margins Costco has very good cost control in a bad economy . I say this because of the subtle recession fears that are cropping up in few but notable places . Areas of concern like job market pessimism creeping unemployment rates drop in consumer sentiment and sustained inflation due in part to tariffs although mostly attributable to monetary expansion . Through it all Costco has great pricing authority very few competitors and a deep focus in a sector that they uniquely have a pulse on . I would argue that they have a unique product mix that captures sales volume shift from grocers like Whole foods and traditional retailer outfits particularly in the apparel space . Costco also has an incredibly diverse consumer base . They can capture sales from small businesses like restauranteurs convenience stores highincome and middleincome households . Looking at their revenue performance between 2007 to 2012 youll see they vaguely experienced any adverse economic consequences in our peak recession years 20082010 . So what could cause Costco to hurt If they fail to respond to merchandise costs in a timely manner and their pricing doesnt track in times of higher inflation or deflation less likely their already thin gross margins can compress further or their revenue less sensitive could decline due to slow tracking . Demographic shifts can also cause harm . As it is Costcos growth is unitary and very linear . Adding square footage and store openings are essential for their growth . Growth is directly tied to their stocks performance . This is a small fear as Costco rarely develops into areas where the future is unknown . They look to real estate values property mix consumer behaviors tied to those demographics etc . Any area could experience a population decline but their growth model hinges tightly to areas with slow drift . As for their share price you can make an argument for them being extremely expensive compared to their historical PE ratios . No_new developments or clues left by their executives hint at anything vastly innovative to warrant belief that their revenue growth will suddenly break beyond their average of 910 % . you can argue their added revenue streams ecommerce RMN and so forth but these have not_materially increased the projected future revenue growth above the 910 % expectation nor are they expected to grow margins to a degree that support the higher share price . So they are expensive based on what we can reasonably price in and the impact on free cash flow to investors . So from a Free cash flow perspective accounting for new growth assumptions we can say that their valuation is almost twice as expensive as what it was ."

      "title": "SNAP faces slowing advertising growth despite product innovation and cost restructuring",
      "selftext": "Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics. However, investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth. Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and emerging social video ecosystems. On the cost side, Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency. Over the past two years, the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions. Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenue-generating features. These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not fully offset revenue growth concerns. Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as long-term differentiation strategies. The company’s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms. Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising, creator partnerships, and interactive commerce experiences. While these technologies offer long-term potential, near-term revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption. Competitive pressure remains one of Snap’s most significant strategic challenges. Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics, targeting infrastructure, and cross-platform engagement. TikTok’s rapid expansion in short-form video and Meta’s continued investment in AI-driven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets. From a trading standpoint, SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements, macro advertising trends, and broader technology sector sentiment. Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles, followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics. Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. Long-term strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company’s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics. The platform’s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets. Additionally, Snap’s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time. However, several risk factors remain. Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms. Additionally, continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing long-term innovation with near-term profitability expectations. From a valuation perspective, SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics. This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms. Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand. Overall, Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hyper-growth toward a more mature monetization and efficiency-focused phase. The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality, but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate. Not financial advice. This summary is based on publicly available filings, earnings reports, and industry analysis. Do you think Snap can improve advertising monetization while maintaining user engagement, or will competitive pressure continue to limit long-term growth potential?",

      "selftext_processed": "Snap Inc. NYSE SNAP has experienced significant volatility over the past several years currently trading in the midsingle to lowdouble digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles . The stock remains well below its historical highs reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as companyspecific challenges related to user monetization and competition . Snap originally gained traction as a fastgrowing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging augmented reality features and a strong appeal among younger demographics . At its peak growth stage the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobilefocused engagement tools . However the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap ’ s business model . From a financial perspective Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth . Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases . Advertising remains the company ’ s primary revenue driver and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on topline performance . Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries creating additional volatility in Snap ’ s revenue trends . User growth has remained relatively stable with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement particularly among Gen Z demographics . However investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth . Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta TikTok and emerging social video ecosystems . On the cost side Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency . Over the past two years the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions . Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenuegenerating features . These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not_fully offset revenue growth concerns . Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as longterm differentiation strategies . The company ’ s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms . Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising creator partnerships and interactive commerce experiences . While these technologies offer longterm potential nearterm revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption . Competitive pressure remains one of Snap ’ s most significant strategic challenges . Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics targeting infrastructure and crossplatform engagement . TikTok ’ s rapid expansion in shortform video and Meta ’ s continued investment in AIdriven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets . From a trading standpoint SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements macro advertising trends and broader technology sector sentiment . Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics . Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases indicating strong institutional and retail participation . Longterm strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company ’ s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics . The platform ’ s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets . Additionally Snap ’ s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time . However several risk factors remain . Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions . Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms . Additionally continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing longterm innovation with nearterm profitability expectations . From a valuation perspective SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics . This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms . Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand . Overall Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hypergrowth toward a more mature monetization and efficiencyfocused phase . The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate . Not_financial advice . This summary is based on publicly available filings earnings reports and industry analysis . Do you think Snap can improve advertising monetization while maintaining user engagement or will competitive pressure continue to limit longterm growth potential"

My thought is that as people become more concerned about power, a trade-off will be that AI servers, etc., will be required to purchase clean energy or clean energy credits starting in 2026 or 2028. My additional thought is that it's difficult for me to believe a new Democratic administration won't come in in 2028 and reverse many decisions, such as those on coal mining and oil drilling.

For example, if your workplace uses Zoom, Slack, Teams, WebEx, a company is unlikely going to rebuild a corporate level messaging system or even a Microsoft Office copy from scratch in-house to replace their enterprise software. I personally think this sell off is a result of overleverage and excessive risk taking resulting in margin calls and panic selling. That's also mixed in with previously high valuations before earnings could actually catch up.

I found a court case in LA (25STCP00746) where the PE firm is getting sued for 50% ownership of the main factory. Seems sketchy hiding a $200M lawsuit and then how much stock Neos is selling day 1 ​Has anyone else looked at this? It seems like they are selling shares while the judge denied their dismissal motion in November. Just trying to figure out if this is standard for PE roll-ups or if it's a major risk I should worry about before buying. Thanks TLDR 1. Private equity firm (Neos) buys MGM transformers for $400M. 2. One of the family members who owned MGM shows up and says 'Hey, I own half of that and you sold it without telling me.' 3. Neos says 'Whoops, didn't check.' (Extremely sus) 4. Judge denies Neos dismissal, (says it looks real) 90% of the time when this happens it gets settled privately 5. PE Firm immediately buys up 3 other much smaller companies, changes their name to sound more like tech/AI, and lists company on stock market to sell their shares to us before the trial starts",

I found a court case in LA 25STCP00746 where the PE firm is getting sued for 50 % ownership of the main factory . Seems sketchy hiding a $ 200M lawsuit and then how much stock Neos is selling day 1 ​Has anyone else looked at this It seems like they are selling shares while the judge denied their dismissal motion in November . Just trying to figure out if this is standard for PE rollups or if its a major risk I should worry about before buying . Thanks TLDR 1 . Private equity firm Neos buys MGM transformers for $ 400M . 2 . One of the family members who owned MGM shows up and says Hey I own half of that and you sold it without telling me . 3 . Neos says Whoops didnt check . Extremely sus 4 . Judge denies Neos dismissal says it looks real 90 % of the time when this happens it gets settled privately 5 . PE Firm immediately buys up 3 other much smaller companies changes their name to sound more like techAI and lists company on stock market to sell their shares to us before the trial starts"

      "selftext": "European central banks are holding rates steady even as inflation continues to cool, signaling a preference for caution over speed. Both the ECB and the Bank of England appear focused on labor market dynamics and second-round inflation risks rather than headline CPI alone. Seems the result is a policy pause that keeps financial conditions tight despite improving data. [European Central Banks Hold Rates Despite Cooling Inflation | Sandmark]( What stands out to me isn’t that they’re holding rates, it’s *why*. This feels less about the current inflation prints and more about protecting institutional credibility after years of being accused of reacting too late. From that perspective, waiting too long is a reputationally safer mistake than cutting early and having to reverse course. It leaves markets in limbo, but it’s consistent with how central banks tend to manage risk when trust is the real constraint. Curious how others take it?",

Both the ECB and the Bank of England appear focused on labor market dynamics and secondround inflation risks rather than headline CPI alone . Seems the result is a policy pause that keeps financial conditions tight despite improving data . European Central Banks Hold Rates Despite Cooling Inflation Sandmark What stands out to me isn ’ t that they ’ re holding rates it ’ s why . This feels less about the current inflation prints and more about protecting institutional credibility after years of being accused of reacting too late . From that perspective waiting too long is a reputationally safer mistake than cutting early and having to reverse course . It leaves markets in limbo but it ’ s consistent with how central banks tend to manage risk when trust is the real constraint . Curious how others take it"

Of course I see that this might be a temporary thing but it might be the start of the end of the world too at least if we read reddit .

      "selftext": "Here's the economic paradox investors need to understand: January saw 108,435 layoffs (highest since 2009), yet PMI data shows economic re-acceleration driving volume into cyclical sectors. How is this possible? The Warsh Efficiency Theory: Companies aren't cutting because demand is dead. PMI proves demand is strong. They're cutting bloat to implement AI and improve margins. This is productivity growth, not recession. The data: AI was explicitly cited as the reason for 7,624 cuts (7% of total). Companies are replacing low-productivity roles with automation, not reducing output. Market Implications: Yesterday's rotation reflects this. Money fled Tech/Semis (down 2-4%) into Industrial Blue Chips, Staples, Energy, Chemicals. The market is asking: \"If AI creates productivity, do I need to pay 30x sales for a SaaS company?\" Winners: • AI Infrastructure (efficiency enablers) • Automation/Robotics • Industrial productivity tools Losers: • Bloated cost structures • Labor-intensive, low-margin operations The Investment Thesis: Don't conflate layoffs with recession. Record January layoffs + strong PMIs = structural efficiency gains, not demand destruction. This is 2026's efficiency revolution, not 2008's demand collapse. Investors who understand this will position away from bloated cost structures, toward efficiency enablers and stable-margin defensives. Educational purposes only. Not financial advice.

      "title": "Korean Shipbuilders' Profits Triple, Near Super Cycle",
      "selftext": "HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, Hanwha Ocean, and Samsung Heavy Industries, the three major South Korean shipbuilders collectively reported an operating profit of 6 trillion Korean won last year. This marks nearly a threefold increase compared to 2024, with performance nearing the \"super cycle\" levels seen around 2010 during the global shipbuilding boom. According to industry sources on the 4th, the combined operating profit of the three companies reached 5.8758 trillion won last year, a 170.1% surge from 2.1747 trillion won in 2024. The trio achieved their first simultaneous profitability in 13 years in 2024, and profits grew sharply again last year. Sales also increased by 15.3% year-on-year to 53.2716 trillion won. This growth stems from the global recovery of the shipbuilding industry and the consecutive orders and deliveries of high-value vessels, including LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been tightening environmental regulations, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 20% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels. This has led to an explosive global demand for eco-friendly vessel replacements. Korean shipyards, which hold a competitive edge over Chinese rivals in this sector, have benefited significantly. Additionally, the three companies’ order backlog stood at $124.42 billion (180.6918 trillion won) as of the end of last year. With enough work piled up for over 3–4 years, the industry anticipates that the three firms will maintain robust performance this year. Record-breaking results continued across the board. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, the mid-tier holding company of HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding division, reported an operating profit of 3.9045 trillion won last year, a 172.3% jump from the previous year, marking its highest ever. Hanwha Ocean saw its operating profit soar by 366.2% to 1.1091 trillion won. Samsung Heavy Industries recorded sales of 10.65 trillion won, re-entering the \"10 trillion won sales club\" for the first time in nine years. Its operating profit also rose by 71.5% year-on-year to 862.2 billion won. [",

      "selftext_processed": "HD Korea Shipbuilding Offshore Engineering Hanwha Ocean and Samsung Heavy Industries the three major South Korean shipbuilders collectively reported an operating profit of 6 trillion Korean won last year . This marks nearly a threefold increase compared to 2024 with performance nearing the super cycle levels seen around 2010 during the global shipbuilding boom . According to industry sources on the 4th the combined operating profit of the three companies reached 5.8758 trillion won last year a 170.1 % surge from 2.1747 trillion won in 2024 . The trio achieved their first simultaneous profitability in 13 years in 2024 and profits grew sharply again last year . Sales also increased by 15.3 % yearonyear to 53.2716 trillion won . This growth stems from the global recovery of the shipbuilding industry and the consecutive orders and deliveries of highvalue vessels including LNG liquefied natural gas carriers . The International Maritime Organization IMO has been tightening environmental regulations aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 20 % by 2030 compared to 2008 levels . This has led to an explosive global demand for ecofriendly vessel replacements . Korean shipyards which hold a competitive edge over Chinese rivals in this sector have benefited significantly . Additionally the three companies ’ order backlog stood at $ 124.42 billion 180.6918 trillion won as of the end of last year . With enough work piled up for over 3–4 years the industry anticipates that the three firms will maintain robust performance this year . Recordbreaking results continued across the board . HD Korea Shipbuilding Offshore Engineering the midtier holding company of HD Hyundai ’ s shipbuilding division reported an operating profit of 3.9045 trillion won last year a 172.3 % jump from the previous year marking its highest ever . Hanwha Ocean saw its operating profit soar by 366.2 % to 1.1091 trillion won . Samsung Heavy Industries recorded sales of 10.65 trillion won reentering the 10 trillion won sales club for the first time in nine years . Its operating profit also rose by 71.5 % yearonyear to 862.2 billion won ."

My grandmother bought them in 2014 at $19.23 and held on to them for me. I just learned about this investment of hers this year even though she passed away back in 2016. I know most are experiencing this, but its like I blink and it rises or drops 10%-15%. Obviously ive never known about this, so im treating it as such still and haven’t necessarily needed to money. I was told about it right before the ATH and probably should have sold then, but it was basically just laid in my lap and I was told to figure it out. By the time I researched it had plummeted. Im here searching for advice on what to do with it and how to properly go about it in such a volatile market. Any and all advice or suggestions are welcome, I just don’t quite understand how to read a market that changes so abruptly and aggressive. Thank you in advance and I hope you all have a wonderful day!",

Any and all advice or suggestions are welcome I just don ’ t quite understand how to read a market that changes so abruptly and aggressive . Thank you in advance and I hope you all have a wonderful day"

      "selftext": "One of the things that people have been complaining about is that the major indicies are at historic highs as far as the Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E). So far this week all the major players who have high P/E's, they have all been reporting GREAT results, better earnings. But the stock price is falling so why is that good? Because the P/E is falling. If you missed GOOG last year it dropped to a P/E below 15 and people realized that was oversold. Currently MSFT is around 25 so maybe it falls further. So earnings are good and unemployment remains historically low (the recent challenger layoff report aside, I think what we are seeing is there are people in the workforce who have been waiting for layoffs and simply now retiring (read r/fire for more), that's why unemployment isn't rising. I have a friend who was thrilled when Bridgestone had major layoffs, he started another company years ago but was waiting for the big bag to officially leave). I'm not saying that the marketing is going to go straight up from here. February is historically a poor month. What I am saying is what everyone knows and yet everyone seems to find every excuse not to do: Buy Low, Sell High. This is an opportunity to buy, not sell.",

When this happens you want to own stocks that produce tons of free cash and give it as dividends. Think Kraft, Conagra, Flowers Foods, etc. and sell the companies that need dollars to operate rather than being able to give it to the investors. If the market demands more oil own the oil companies, right now the market is demanding dollars. Own the dollar generating companies.",

This started when Trump nominated Warsh because Warsh wants to end QE . This pulls liquidity out of the markets and demand for dollars goes up . When this happens you want to own stocks that produce tons of free cash and give it as dividends . Think Kraft Conagra Flowers Foods etc . and sell the companies that need dollars to operate rather than being able to give it to the investors . If the market demands more oil own the oil companies right now the market is demanding dollars . Own the dollar generating companies ."

SpaceX advisers have sought index policy changes that would fast-track its entry into major indexes for the company and benefit other highly-valued private companies, the people said. >Last valued at $800 billion, SpaceX is targeting a valuation of more than $1 trillion, a listing that would become the largest-ever U.S. IPO. Also worth noting that Elon Musk is seeking changes to the 6-month lockout period after a company IPOs so he can liquidate some of his SpaceX stock more quickly after the IPO. I think this is interesting in terms of how eager people might be to participate in SpaceX's IPO but I think the much bigger story here is potential changes to how long companies must be public before being included in the major indexes. I worry that this could be really harmful to retail investors, especially if it is paired with a reduced lockout period for executives of newly publicly traded companies. It has the potential to reward companies and executives more on successfully marketing an IPO event than successfully running a company and the liquidity provided by the major indexes could float a scam for a long time. I'm almost entirely an index investor and the prospect of this if pretty frightening to me, I'm not sure how I would pivot as I never had to think too deeply about investing before",

Advisers for the company which recently merged with xAI have reached out to major index providers including Nasdaq to discuss how SpaceX and this year ’ s other hot startups might join key indexes sooner than normal according to people familiar with the matter . Companies typically must wait several months or a year after their public debut before gaining inclusion in a major index such as the SP 500 or the Nasdaq100 . Inclusion unlocks access to retail and institutional capital from funds particularly those mimicking the performance of indexes that have to hold the companies in the index . The traditional waiting period is intended to give the companies time to demonstrate that they are stable and liquid enough to handle extensive buying from index funds . SpaceX hopes to skirt traditional rules in an effort to bring liquidity to its shareholders sooner as part of its planned IPO . SpaceX advisers have sought index policy changes that would fasttrack its entry into major indexes for the company and benefit other highlyvalued private companies the people said . Last valued at $ 800 billion SpaceX is targeting a valuation of more than $ 1 trillion a listing that would become the largestever U.S. IPO . Also worth noting that Elon Musk is seeking changes to the 6month lockout period after a company IPOs so he can liquidate some of his SpaceX stock more quickly after the IPO . I think this is interesting in terms of how eager people might be to participate in SpaceXs IPO but I think the much bigger story here is potential changes to how long companies must be public before being included in the major indexes . I worry that this could be really harmful to retail investors especially if it is paired with a reduced lockout period for executives of newly publicly traded companies . It has the potential to reward companies and executives more on successfully marketing an IPO event than successfully running a company and the liquidity provided by the major indexes could float a scam for a long time . Im almost entirely an index investor and the prospect of this if pretty frightening to me Im not_sure how I would pivot as I never_had to think too deeply about investing before"

Particularly this week there is a panic reaction to anthropics new product announcement. Undoubtedly the 'per seat' revenue model is going to take a hit but some are down 80% YoY despite consistent and sustained growth. It smells of being into oversold territory. Agents are useful to be used in the SMB space for some trades people but as soon as your business gets scale your going too need a solid trustworthy tech stack to store and draw your data from that humans can also use as people like to get stuck into the details, so.. Am I wrong to think it's more likely agentic capabilities on a CRM humans also use is more likely to succeed than a pure agentic system where your data vanishes into some black box.",

Undoubtedly the per seat revenue model is going to take a hit but some are down 80 % YoY despite consistent and sustained growth . It smells of being into oversold territory . Agents are useful to be used in the SMB space for some trades people but as soon as your business gets scale your going too need a solid trustworthy tech stack to store and draw your data from that humans can also use as people like to get stuck into the details so .. Am I wrong to think its more likely agentic capabilities on a CRM humans also use is more likely to succeed than a pure agentic system where your data vanishes into some black box ."

      "selftext": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade (for the stocks he got when he sold his company). Mid last year, a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm, QS, Sofi, etc were doing very well. They were at their respective ATH. Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax (including some STCG). And nobody knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH. So apart from potential higher taxes, the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market. But then, what if market reverses the direction from here ? The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns - gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside. Cost was just a little premium (collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC - and if you choose different months for the put and calls, the cost could be 0 or even positive). Eg. QS reached highs n late 2025. And now it is back to \\~8 (down 50% than the highs). But a collar position with expiry in 2026, I paid just a little premium - allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices. And gave me right to sell at \\~16 even if stock goes down - which turned out the case. Now even when it is at \\~8, I shall be able to sell at \\~$16. I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating. I wish, I had known this in 2021/22 when we had such peaks and then big drops. Sharing as it has helped me. See if it helps you in the future. This is not an advice. DYOR. Good luck!",

      "selftext_processed": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade for the stocks he got when he sold his company . Mid last year a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm QS Sofi etc were doing very well . They were at their respective ATH . Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax including some STCG . And nobody_knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH . So apart from potential higher taxes the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market . But then what if market reverses the direction from here The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside . Cost was just a little premium collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC and if you choose different months for the put and calls the cost could be 0 or even positive . Eg . QS reached highs n late 2025 . And now it is back to 8 down 50 % than the highs . But a collar position with expiry in 2026 I paid just a little premium allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices . And gave me right to sell at 16 even if stock goes down which turned out the case . Now even when it is at 8 I shall be able to sell at $ 16 . I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating . I wish I had known this in 202122 when we had such peaks and then big drops . Sharing as it has helped me . See if it helps you in the future . This is not_an advice . DYOR . Good luck"

      "selftext": "Look guys, this is pretty simple. SpaceX wants to go public at an eye-watering $1.5 _trillion_ valuation. What are the earnings for this out-of-this-world company? [$8 Billion]( That gives us a PE ratio of, checks notes, 187. (Edit: I've been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA, not earnings, so the PE ratio is probably north of 300. NOICE.) Now, this is 2026, PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed, but still, there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation, right? Ah, yes. Datacenters in space. Sure, Elon is the world's biggest bullshit factory, but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint. Self driving cars? Yeah! Robotaxis? Sure! Humanoid sexdolls? Why not! But what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for. We've got datacenters at home, goddamit. (Of course, it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich, a shitducken so to speak, but whose counting shit here). Here is my prediction. Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers, IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch. There will be a roadshow, and pension funds, endowments, etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it. And I don't think they will. So instead of the famously diamond-handed Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO, it will be desperate buyers of ~~hand grenades~~ hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like god's asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim. Now, that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_, but we're talking SpaceX here. _Elon_. Either the IPO doesn't happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle. And people will panic. The entire AI narrative that has been holding on our K-shaped economy will blow up like a little kid flying into space when his fat cousin jumps off the see-saw. Bye, timmy. Just you fucking wait. Buying calls.",

      "selftext_processed": "Look guys this is pretty simple . SpaceX wants to go public at an eyewatering $ 1.5 _trillion_ valuation . What are the earnings for this outofthisworld company $ 8 Billion That gives us a PE ratio of checks notes 187 . Edit Ive been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA not_earnings so the PE ratio is probably north of 300 . NOICE . Now this is 2026 PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed but still there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation right Ah yes . Datacenters in space . Sure Elon is the worlds biggest bullshit factory but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint . Self driving cars Yeah Robotaxis Sure Humanoid sexdolls Why not_But what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for . Weve got datacenters at home goddamit . Of course it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich a shitducken so to speak but whose counting shit here . Here is my prediction . Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch . There will be a roadshow and pension funds endowments etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it . And I dont think they will . So instead of the famously diamondhanded Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO it will be desperate buyers of hand grenades hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like gods asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim . Now that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_ but were talking SpaceX here . _Elon_ . Either the IPO doesnt happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle . And people will panic . The entire AI narrative that has been holding on our Kshaped economy will blow up like a little kid flying into space when his fat cousin jumps off the seesaw . Bye timmy . Just you fucking wait . Buying calls ."

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Burry isn’t wrong to warn about valuation risk in crypto-linked stocks, but his bankruptcy narrative misunderstands how ETFs, miners, and balance sheets actually work for **MARA** and **MSTR.** I hope he reads this headline because I mean it. I‘ve following Michael Burry for quite a while, and he’s generally likable, has a decent understanding of macroeconomics, but he broad-brushes scenarios across industries he doesn’t fully understand the mechanics of. My first flag of doubt came after he spoke on how the index investors were making a huge mistake by moving into passive ETFs. He claimed that ETF sponsors would not know how to navigate massive liquidity events, where either the ETF shares or the underlying assets would face major selling pressures and decouple. This, I believe, stemmed from a complete misunderstanding on how the ETFs are created and destroyed and the markets that make them in the first place. Since the rise in ETF‘s popularity, there have been quite a number of events that tested his hypothesis and proved him to be wrong. Overtly wrong. His more recent callout was directed towards the decline of Bitcoin and how it would be fatal to the big-name mining companies. I read what he’s put out there to make sure I wasn’t grossly overlooking anything, and after doing some scenario testing at a $35-45k price point, I can honestly say there is not remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he’s supposing we’ll see. I‘m not a bitcoin guy. I love the blockchain technology, but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin. Recently, I’ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies. I think crypto mining and staking isn’t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies. I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA, your company isn’t at risk of disappearing overnight. Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors: a lack of balance sheet flexibility, lack of liquidity to maintain operations, declining operating income, persistent DSCR <1, or high maintenance capital costs. pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy. Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy (who hasn’t?). …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor’s, he’s far from bankrupt. MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt. MARA, the other company he’s picked on, also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow. Though their bankruptcy risk is a non-zero probability, it’s still incredibly low. The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it’s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin. Done. That‘s all to be said. I‘d accept that warning all day. Everything else is just noise.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Burry isn ’ t wrong to warn about valuation risk in cryptolinked stocks but his bankruptcy narrative misunderstands how ETFs miners and balance sheets actually work for MARA and MSTR . I hope he reads this headline because I mean it . I ‘ ve following Michael Burry for quite a while and he ’ s generally likable has a decent understanding of macroeconomics but he broadbrushes scenarios across industries he doesn ’ t fully understand the mechanics of . My first flag of doubt came after he spoke on how the index investors were making a huge mistake by moving into passive ETFs . He claimed that ETF sponsors would not_know how to navigate massive liquidity events where either the ETF shares or the underlying assets would face major selling pressures and decouple . This I believe stemmed from a complete misunderstanding on how the ETFs are created and destroyed and the markets that make them in the first place . Since the rise in ETF ‘ s popularity there have been quite a number of events that tested his hypothesis and proved him to be wrong . Overtly wrong . His more recent callout was directed towards the decline of Bitcoin and how it would be fatal to the bigname mining companies . I read what he ’ s put out there to make sure I wasn ’ t grossly overlooking anything and after doing some scenario testing at a $ 3545k price point I can honestly say there is not_remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he ’ s supposing we ’ ll see . I ‘ m not_a bitcoin guy . I love the blockchain technology but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin . Recently I ’ ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies . I think crypto mining and staking isn ’ t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies . I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA your company isn ’ t at risk of disappearing overnight . Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors a lack of balance sheet flexibility lack of liquidity to maintain operations declining operating income persistent DSCR 1 or high maintenance capital costs . pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy . Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy who hasn ’ t . …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor ’ s he ’ s far from bankrupt . MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt . MARA the other company he ’ s picked on also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow . Though their bankruptcy risk is a nonzero probability it ’ s still incredibly low . The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it ’ s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin . Done . That ‘ s all to be said . I ‘ d accept that warning all day . Everything else is just noise ."

Keep in account china accounted for 25% of sales from NVDA Down to now 8% this happened due to export regulations on WEAKER H20 CHIPS.. now significantly more valuable H200 chips just got green light from 🥭 waiting on NVDA approval huge turn of events. I can’t post in DD section yet as I don’t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn. This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we’re talking 25 + Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models. Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April. Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I’ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow.

When NVDA said early last year that ’ ll cost them 5.5 Billion in 1 quarter April 2025 for the ban likely 20 billion on year . Keep in account china accounted for 25 % of sales from NVDA Down to now 8 % this happened due to export regulations on WEAKER H20 CHIPS .. now significantly more valuable H200 chips just got green light from 🥭 waiting on NVDA approval huge turn of events . I can ’ t post in DD section yet as I don ’ t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn . This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we ’ re talking 25 Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models . Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April . Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I ’ ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow .

      "selftext": "When Figma IPO’d, there was a lot of hype. It’s a great product, tons of designers use it, and it felt like one of those stocks you had to own. Now the stock is down about 80% from its IPO, and I’m wondering how people who bought in are feeling. Do you regret buying, or do you still believe in the company long term and see this as just part of the ride? For those who didn’t buy, does it feel like you dodged a bullet, or are you starting to think this might be a good chance to get in at a much lower price? With tech stocks getting hit hard and expectations coming back to earth, this seems like a good example of hype vs. reality. Curious to hear how everyone’s looking at it now.",

      "selftext": "This is a theory I want to put across this board? And invite a discussion or scrutiny. My theory is that what we call \"tech\" now, may not be tech in the long run. At least not cutting edge tech. Yesterday's tech (software) has been taken over by Today's tech (AI/Quantum/Robotics) Today's tech will be replaced by tomorrow's tech and so on. But the companies can survive. At least some if not all. There might already be projects done within the company on technologies that will replace today's cutting edge technologies. Some within these Big Tech companies, others outside of Big Tech but Big Tech can easily buy those companies. Say biotechnology becomes the next big thing that gets a lot of attention. Or Agriculture. With deep pockets, these companies can easily gain a lead and keep their top positions. Sure not all will survive and not all those who will be the top companies in the future are already at the top. But if I were to invest in tech etfs, I don't think I need to be worried I think these tech etfs should continuously beat the broader market. 10 year CAGR for vgt is 22.6% where's s&p 500 is 14.7%. Am I missing something?",

At least not_cutting edge tech . Yesterdays tech software has been taken over by Todays tech AIQuantumRobotics Todays tech will be replaced by tomorrows tech and so on . But the companies can survive . At least some if not_all . There might already be projects done within the company on technologies that will replace todays cutting edge technologies . Some within these Big Tech companies others outside of Big Tech but Big Tech can easily buy those companies . Say biotechnology becomes the next big thing that gets a lot of attention . Or Agriculture . With deep pockets these companies can easily gain a lead and keep their top positions . Sure not_all will survive and not_all those who will be the top companies in the future are already at the top . But if I were to invest in tech etfs I dont think I need to be worried I think these tech etfs should continuously beat the broader market . 10 year CAGR for vgt is 22.6 % wheres sp 500 is 14.7 % . Am I missing something"

      "selftext": "I listened to the Microsoft and Google Q4 Earnings and although you can never be 100% confident going into an earnings report, I believe AMZN has a 95%+ chance of beating their earnings materially. Here's why I think that: * Azure doesn't have strong custom silicon (they are trying to catch-up with Maya) compared to GCP (TPUs) and AWS (Trainium) and I believe this will truly be more apparent this quarter. Even without potential margin expansion from restructurings and robotics in their fulfilment centers, I think this will be an extremely strong earnings report from Amazon. Whether the market reacts favorably or unfavorably due to increases in Capital spend (like it has with Microsoft & Google) will be a different story. I think based on the above and the potential for a Prime subscription price hike to mitigate tariff impacts (unless SCOTUS rules on it), AMZN is due for a stock run-up. The timing is not ideal with a broad tech sell-off the past week (and is why I'd stick to stock not short-dated options), but my Price Target is $250 - $260 after earnings and $300 EOY.

They spun off from Lennar LEN in February 2025 . They currently pay a very nice dividend of 10.04 % . Their payout ratio is 108.74 % . From what I have read the high payout ratio suggests their dividend is not_sustainable . Is the high dividend just a temporary lure to get investors to buy in What have you seen with other stocks that offer a high dividend like this"

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about where the next truly big investment opportunities are going to come from, and honestly, I’m struggling to get excited about what's possible right now. Obviously we have the big tech giants, but I'm talking about some long term multi bagger that I can jeet into. When you look at what VCs are funding today, SaaS apps, iOS apps & AI wrappers, it feels like competitive advantage is thinner than ever. Building software is cheaper, faster, and more accessible than at any point in history, I can literally make a Notion/Monday.com equivalent from my bed in 1 day. As a result, a lot of “moats” seem to boil down to marketing, distribution, or short-term execution rather than anything structural. That naturally compresses multiples over time. Then you zoom out to the layer these apps are built on: the AI models themselves. Most applications are model-agnostic. If you’re using OpenAI today, you can switch to Gemini, Claude, or another model tomorrow with relatively low friction. APIs are increasingly interchangeable, and customers don’t care *which* model you’re using as long as it works. Again, hard to see durable competitive advantage here. So you go one layer deeper: infrastructure,data centers, compute, chips. But here too, the picture isn’t great. These businesses are insanely capital intensive, require massive scale to generate decent returns, and are likely to be cash-flow negative for a long time. At the current valuations, it’s not obvious that risk-adjusted returns are attractive unless you’re already a hyperscaler. That leaves me with a question on where to invest next... If apps have weak moats, models are interchangeable, and infrastructure is capital-heavy with questionable economics… **where is the real, durable value being created in tech right now?** ik this is a pessimistic take, but I also don’t get excited about putting capital into KO, PEP, and consumer staples tbh nothing new there. I’m curious where people see *investable* opportunities that actually have long-term defensibility.",

These businesses are insanely capital intensive require massive scale to generate decent returns and are likely to be cashflow negative for a long time . At the current valuations it ’ s not_obvious that riskadjusted returns are attractive unless you ’ re already a hyperscaler . That leaves me with a question on where to invest next ... If apps have weak moats models are interchangeable and infrastructure is capitalheavy with questionable economics… where is the real durable value being created in tech right now ik this is a pessimistic take but I also don ’ t get excited about putting capital into KO PEP and consumer staples tbh nothing_new there . I ’ m curious where people see investable opportunities that actually have longterm defensibility ."

      "selftext": "Revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were $74.5 million compared with $61.4 million for the same period of fiscal 2024. The year-over-year increase was driven by organic growth and the acquisition of Comtrafo, which closed on December 5, 2025, contributing partial results from the final weeks of the quarter. Our third quarter fiscal 2025 net income and non-GAAP net income include a $113.1 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. Given this discrete tax benefit, AMSC’s net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $117.8 million, or $2.68 per share, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2024. The Company’s non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $123.5 million, or $2.81 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net income of $6.0 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2024. Please refer to the financial table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on December 31, 2025, totaled $147.1 million, compared with $85.4 million at March 31, 2025. \"AMSC delivered an outstanding third quarter,\" said Daniel P. McGahn, Chairman, President, and CEO, AMSC. \"We grew revenue by more than 20% year-over-year, and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability and our tenth of non-GAAP profitability. Reflecting our shift to profitability, we also recorded a tax benefit event this quarter. Again, gross margin exceeded 30% and we ended the quarter with over $145 million in cash after completing the acquisition of Comtrafo. Strong market demand drove bookings resulting in a robust 12-month backlog of over $250 million. Revenue through the past nine months nearly matches our total revenue for the entire prior fiscal year, highlighting our company's financial and end-market momentum.\" Business Outlook For the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2026, AMSC expects that its revenues will exceed $80.0 million. The Company’s net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to exceed $3.0 million, or $0.07 per share. The Company's non-GAAP net income (as defined below) is expected to exceed $8.0 million, or $0.17 per share.",

The yearoveryear increase was driven by organic growth and the acquisition of Comtrafo which closed on December 5 2025 contributing partial results from the final weeks of the quarter . Our third quarter fiscal 2025 net income and nonGAAP net income include a $ 113.1 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset . Given this discrete tax benefit AMSC ’ s net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $ 117.8 million or $ 2.68 per share compared to $ 2.5 million or $ 0.07 per share for the same period of fiscal 2024 . The Company ’ s nonGAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $ 123.5 million or $ 2.81 per share compared with a nonGAAP net income of $ 6.0 million or $ 0.16 per share in the same period of fiscal 2024 . Please refer to the financial table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to nonGAAP results . Cash cash equivalents and restricted cash on December 31 2025 totaled $ 147.1 million compared with $ 85.4 million at March 31 2025 . AMSC delivered an outstanding third quarter said Daniel P. McGahn Chairman President and CEO AMSC . We grew revenue by more than 20 % yearoveryear and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability and our tenth of nonGAAP profitability . Reflecting our shift to profitability we also recorded a tax benefit event this quarter . Again gross margin exceeded 30 % and we ended the quarter with over $ 145 million in cash after completing the acquisition of Comtrafo . Strong market demand drove bookings resulting in a robust 12month backlog of over $ 250 million . Revenue through the past nine months nearly matches our total revenue for the entire prior fiscal year highlighting our companys financial and endmarket momentum . Business Outlook For the fourth quarter ending March 31 2026 AMSC expects that its revenues will exceed $ 80.0 million . The Company ’ s net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to exceed $ 3.0 million or $ 0.07 per share . The Companys nonGAAP net income as defined below is expected to exceed $ 8.0 million or $ 0.17 per share ."

      "selftext": "Warren Buffet has taken a massive stake in OXY, now at approximately $12B. I am wondering if this stock looks attractive to anyone else? Things to consider: 1. Oil prices are hovering around 5 year lows, could see price tailwinds due to geopolitical tensions 2. Validation from Buffet at 27% stake; says he might own this stock \"forever\". Buffet also recently purchased their chemical division OxyChem, reducing company debt. 3. Occidental has approximately 40% stake in a company called NET Power (NPWR), who is working on emerging natural gas technology called super critical CO2 (sCO2). OXY has upwards of $350m invested in this company/technology. 4. Profitable company with dividend 2.12% dividend. (Nothing to write home about but there are a lot of unprofitable companies out there!) 5. PE ratio of 34x is expensive for E&P companies 6. Super critical CO2 is exciting technology (90% reduction in reactor size, zero emissions, etc.) but first commercial demonstration will not be proven out until 2028 at the earliest. Also faces competition from GEV and others. 7. Buffet's average cost is about $51.76 per share, so he is underwater on this one. What's your opinion, do you think Warren is wrong on this one or is it a smart 3-5 year play?",

The reason GOOG MSFT ETC are having large capital expenditures is because they need to fulfill the growing demand for memory and storage . This is fueled by AI they will bite the bullet now because in the end if they stay on top once the semiconductor prices drop down towards the end of the decade . The AI ship will be running smoothly and much cheaper . These companies can ’ t slow down or else they will literally fall behind . This is almost bound to happen with the really large names .

      "selftext": "Smart glasses are disrupting smartphones as the next generation human-to-computer interface. Meta leads in spending reportedly up to 100B in AR/VR efforts. Consumer, industrial and military adoption is happening fast. One phone maker has already abandoned hand-held devices for glasses. I'm more interested in growth exposure than getting a pair. This is Meta's best chance of entrenching its media platforms into next hardware transition. Apple is conjuring something and Google is jumping back into battle after defeat of its first Glass attempt. Samsung is Android armed but MSFT appears done with AR after handing its program over to Anduril. Competition is fierce. The Bigs are willing to ignore hardware profits to build or maintain walled gardens. Unlike with phones, China has access to US AR markets and doing very well. US companies will remain leaders as wearables become the ultimate AI infrastructure. Google seems favored with software advantage but Meta is clearly ahead in hardware. New, optical technology is driving most development and suppliers have potentially more growth opportunity than choosing between multi-trillion dollar market caps financing advanced tech for eyeballs. AR tech has many directions but I'm focused on what Meta, the market leader is saying. Would love to learn more about LED projection leaders but they are mostly in Taiwan. Silicon Carbide (SiC) has emerged as holy grail of AR lens material. Most SiC stocks are down, apparently from EV downturn but electrification is unstoppable. Meta is [obsessed with SiC]( for AR lenses, representing enormous new market for SiC material players. AR lenses use much more material than semiconductors. Meta says very [clearly that SiC]( is their goal for AR lenses. Director of Meta optics, Barry Silverstein is practically begging industry for more SiC in this [Photonics Spectra article]( I have a basket of SiC and GaN stocks focused mainly on SiC materials market leader. I also have been building high performance battery plays but they have optimistic valuations right now. Curious how others are investing in the AR glasses and related optics space. EDIT TO ADD: Thought readers were better informed about AR market growth and it's growing role as AI infrastructure. Meta is reportedly considering production capacity of 20 Million units per year by end of this year. 20M is 2X more than all '08 I phone sales. According to Gemini: >The Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses market is experiencing rapid, high-growth, with shipments projected to jump from roughly 850,000 in 2024 to 32 million by 2030, a CAGR of 82.9% in the consumer segment. Driven by AI integration, lightweight designs, and no-display models, the broader market is expected to grow 39.2% in 2025.",

      "selftext_processed": "Smart glasses are disrupting smartphones as the next generation humantocomputer interface . Meta leads in spending reportedly up to 100B in ARVR efforts . Consumer industrial and military adoption is happening fast . One phone maker has already abandoned handheld devices for glasses . Im more interested in growth exposure than getting a pair . This is Metas best chance of entrenching its media platforms into next hardware transition . Apple is conjuring something and Google is jumping back into battle after defeat of its first Glass attempt . Samsung is Android armed but MSFT appears done with AR after handing its program over to Anduril . Competition is fierce . The Bigs are willing to ignore hardware profits to build or maintain walled gardens . Unlike with phones China has access to US AR markets and doing very well . US companies will remain leaders as wearables become the ultimate AI infrastructure . Google seems favored with software advantage but Meta is clearly ahead in hardware . New optical technology is driving most development and suppliers have potentially more growth opportunity than choosing between multitrillion dollar market caps financing advanced tech for eyeballs . AR tech has many directions but Im focused on what Meta the market leader is saying . Would love to learn more about LED projection leaders but they are mostly in Taiwan . Silicon Carbide SiC has emerged as holy grail of AR lens material . Most SiC stocks are down apparently from EV downturn but electrification is unstoppable . Meta is obsessed with SiC for AR lenses representing enormous new market for SiC material players . AR lenses use much more material than semiconductors . Meta says very clearly that SiC is their goal for AR lenses . Director of Meta optics Barry Silverstein is practically begging industry for more SiC in this Photonics Spectra article I have a basket of SiC and GaN stocks focused mainly on SiC materials market leader . I also have been building high performance battery plays but they have optimistic valuations right now . Curious how others are investing in the AR glasses and related optics space . EDIT TO ADD Thought readers were better informed about AR market growth and its growing role as AI infrastructure . Meta is reportedly considering production capacity of 20 Million units per year by end of this year . 20M is 2X more than all 08 I phone sales . According to Gemini The Augmented Reality AR smart glasses market is experiencing rapid highgrowth with shipments projected to jump from roughly 850000 in 2024 to 32 million by 2030 a CAGR of 82.9 % in the consumer segment . Driven by AI integration lightweight designs and nodisplay_models the broader market is expected to grow 39.2 % in 2025 ."

      "selftext": "# DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat. The stock is down over 90% from all time highs in 2021, currently trading at roughly $6 per share with a $10B market cap. The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management, best personified by their hedonistic CEO (Evan Spiegel) who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years, creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune. This, coupled with strong competition from $META, has driven sentiment to perhaps an all-time low. But behind all of this I see, and the data tells me, that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential, currently generating its highest revenue in company history, something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenue-model and the launch of their heavily researched & developed AR Glasses. *Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1...* I have been plotting a $snap long for weeks now, and given the recent sell-off (1-month decline of -30%), I think being long going into earnings offers amazing risk/reward. I will try to concisely summarize my stance: # Snapchat+ Subscriptions: * **The Perfect Rugpull -** Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters. Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025, effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories. The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscription-based revenue and becomes less reliant on ads. Net Profitability will increase: non paying users = less AWS expenses, Paying users = high-margin revenue * **The Data -** Kevory tried compiling [data]( i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications * **My Subscription Forecast -** I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount, as well as users who pay for storage only: |**Quarter**|**Subscribers**|**Other Revenue**|**Analysis**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q1 2025**|**14 Million**|\\~$155M|Shift toward creator-focused features.| |**Q2 2025**|**15 Million**|\\~$170M|Steady organic growth. 9% of total revenue.| |**Q3 2025**|**17 Million**|**$190M**|**Pre-Storage Spike:** Accelerated 35% YoY growth. 12.6% of total revenue.| |**Q4 2025 (Est)**|**19.5M - 20M**|**$245M+**|**The Storage Catalyst:** First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact. Up to 15% of total revenue.| # Spectacles (AR Glasses): * **Launch of market-leading AR Glasses** \\- Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026. Has Spent over $3 Billion in R&D over the past decade. Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem (400k+ developers) and in certain aspects of hardware. * **Superior Balance Sheet -** Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $Snap look superior in the future (less R&D costs), while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META. # Management: There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down: * **SBC (share based compensation) -** historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses. I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential. Things can only get better from here. *Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1...* * **Meta competition -** because of Spiegel’s unwillingness to sell to Meta, Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta. Meta also has in-house datacenters and a more-optimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable. Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU - big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order. Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META. What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitude/approach, stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company, with 90-day mission-cycles and 100x returns. # The Upcoming Earnings: * **Christmas and AI Pump -** Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge. Meta recently beat massively much thanks to ai-driven ad optimization, something I forecast also has helped Snap. Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future. * **Mean reversion -** Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings. Currently -20% on the week. With sentiment being at all time lows, I expect a classic inverse move. |**Quarter**|**Report Date**|**1-Week Pre-Earnings**|**Next Day Reaction**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q3 2025**|Nov 5, 2025|**+4.8%**|**+9.7%**| |**Q2 2025**|Aug 5, 2025|**+6.8%**|**-17.2%**| |**Q1 2025**|Apr 29, 2025|**+12.2%**|**-12.4%**| |**Q4 2024**|Feb 4, 2025|**+2.1%**|**-8.4%**| |**Q3 2024**|Oct 29, 2024|**+5.3%**|**-14.1%**| |**Q2 2024**|Aug 1, 2024|**+3.9%**|**-18.3%**| |**Q1 2024**|Apr 25, 2024|**-4.1%**|**+27.6%**| |**Q4 2023**|Feb 6, 2024|**+8.4%**|**-34.6%**| * **Expectations:** Stock is at a 52-week low ($6.00) and priced for a \"double-miss\" disaster. According to my data we will see a massive double beat. Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures, but forecast it to be big. Recent analyst ratings: * Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $9 to $10 on Jan. 30, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $10 to $9 on Jan. 20, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $9.5 to $8.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%. * Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an Equal-Weight rating and raised the price target from $8.5 to $9.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69%. * Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $9 to $8.5 on Dec. 19, 2025. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71%. In summary, given the current price of snap, I forecast any risk of earnings-centred pullback to be miniscule. I think the market is pricing the stock for a double-miss, the data tells me we are gonna see a double beat. People have the misconception that the company is dying, but my view is contrarian. DAU and revenue is steadily increasing, with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers. # TLDR: * I entered a Long on $SNAP today ahead of earnings (which come after market close) * Market has priced the stock for a double miss. I think we will see a double beat.",

      "selftext_processed": "DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat . The stock is down over 90 % from all time highs in 2021 currently trading at roughly $ 6 per share with a $ 10B market cap . The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management best personified by their hedonistic CEO Evan Spiegel who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune . This coupled with strong competition from $ META has driven sentiment to perhaps an alltime low . But behind all of this I see and the data tells me that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential currently generating its highest revenue in company history something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenuemodel and the launch of their heavily researched developed AR Glasses . Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1 ... I have been plotting a $ snap long for weeks now and given the recent selloff 1month decline of 30 % I think being long going into earnings offers amazing riskreward . I will try to concisely summarize my stance Snapchat Subscriptions The Perfect Rugpull Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters . Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025 effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories . The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscriptionbased revenue and becomes less reliant on ads . Net Profitability will increase non paying users less AWS expenses Paying users highmargin revenue The Data Kevory tried compiling data i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications My Subscription Forecast I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount as well as users who pay for storage only QuarterSubscribersOther RevenueAnalysis Q1 202514 Million $ 155MShift toward creatorfocused features . Q2 202515 Million $ 170MSteady organic growth . 9 % of total revenue . Q3 202517 Million $ 190MPreStorage Spike Accelerated 35 % YoY growth . 12.6 % of total revenue . Q4 2025 Est19.5M 20M $ 245MThe Storage Catalyst First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact . Up to 15 % of total revenue . Spectacles AR Glasses Launch of marketleading AR Glasses Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026 . Has Spent over $ 3 Billion in RD over the past decade . Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem 400k developers and in certain aspects of hardware . Superior Balance Sheet Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $ Snap look superior in the future less RD costs while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META . Management There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down SBC share based compensation historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses . I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential . Things can only get better from here . Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1 ... Meta competition because of Spiegel ’ s unwillingness to sell to Meta Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta . Meta also has inhouse datacenters and a moreoptimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable . Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order . Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META . What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitudeapproach stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company with 90day missioncycles and 100x returns . The Upcoming Earnings Christmas and AI Pump Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge . Meta recently beat massively much thanks to aidriven ad optimization something I forecast also has helped Snap . Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future . Mean reversion Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings . Currently 20 % on the week . With sentiment being at all time lows I expect a classic inverse move . QuarterReport Date1Week PreEarningsNext Day Reaction Q3 2025Nov 5 20254.8 % 9.7 % Q2 2025Aug 5 20256.8 % 17.2 % Q1 2025Apr 29 202512.2 % 12.4 % Q4 2024Feb 4 20252.1 % 8.4 % Q3 2024Oct 29 20245.3 % 14.1 % Q2 2024Aug 1 20243.9 % 18.3 % Q1 2024Apr 25 20244.1 % 27.6 % Q4 2023Feb 6 20248.4 % 34.6 % Expectations Stock is at a 52week low $ 6.00 and priced for a doublemiss disaster . According to my data we will see a massive double beat . Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures but forecast it to be big . Recent analyst ratings Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $ 9 to $ 10 on Jan. 30 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 10 to $ 9 on Jan. 20 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $ 9.5 to $ 8.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77 % . Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an EqualWeight rating and raised the price target from $ 8.5 to $ 9.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69 % . Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 9 to $ 8.5 on Dec. 19 2025 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71 % . In summary given the current price of snap I forecast any risk of earningscentred pullback to be miniscule . I think the market is pricing the stock for a doublemiss the data tells me we are gon na see a double beat . People have the misconception that the company is dying but my view is contrarian . DAU and revenue is steadily increasing with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers . TLDR I entered a Long on $ SNAP today ahead of earnings which come after market close Market has priced the stock for a double miss . I think we will see a double beat ."

      "selftext": "For context I’m 19, have $15k in my ROTH, and the Army is paying for the rest of my school/board. I have no real future costs for the next 5y, as I just paid the $22k the army wouldn’t cover. I have $6k liquid cash, and have been thinking about putting $4k into Microsoft. It’s now reset to its 1-year point, which feels like an incredible opportunity. However, every other tech stock has seemingly tripled. I can’t figure out what that means to me. Does that mean Microsoft is crazy undervalued and will start to skyrocket its recovery in the future? Or does it mean it’s not a smart choice? I know nobody truly knows, but am looking for at least a more experience opinion than mine. There’s also the aspect that if there is a bubble that crashes, if Microsoft wasn’t effected by the up, it wouldn’t be effected by the downs, and I don’t lose my money. On the other hand, if there is no pop, that 4K could have doubled in a couple years in a different company while it remains instead stagnant in Microsoft. Microsoft is nearly down to where it was at times in 2024. Anyways yea just looking for thoughts. Anything is appreciated",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 40 years old and currently invested in Vanguard Target Date Fund 2065 in my 401(k). It’s been a solid “set it and forget it” option, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s too conservative for my actual timeline and goals. I’m planning to retire somewhere in my early to mid‑60s, so realistically I still have 20–25 years of compounding ahead of me. That’s a long runway, and I’m thinking about shifting to a more high‑growth / aggressive allocation while I still can. Here's the URL link of available funds: [**401k Fidelity Available Funds**]( I’m considering building my own allocation instead of sticking with the TDF, something like: \\- Heavy S&P 500 exposure \\- A tilt toward large‑cap growth \\- Maybe a small slice of mid/small caps \\- Minimal or no bonds for now Basically, a more aggressive equity mix that could outperform the TDF over the long haul, with the understanding that I’d rebalance periodically. So, I'm thinking of below. **PROPOSED INVESTMENT:** 60% FXAIX (S&P 500) 20% FSPGX (Large Cap Growth) 10% FSPSX (International Index) 10% FSMDX or RSPYX (Mid or Small Cap) **WHY**: I think it's diversified enough to avoid concentration risk as it keeps the S&P 500 as the core, adds growth, but not overwhelmingly, adds mid/small caps for factor diversification, and keeps a small international slice for global exposure. It's aggressive, but not fragile -- if that makes sense and my opinion. And easy to manage a 4-fund portfolio. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "I've heard it all: \"Value Trap, Dying business, Competition\" Let's start from the $310 price it was in 2021. There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high. That puts PayPal close to a $300B valuation with $4B net income. It was trading for 80X earnings. Let's talk about the positives: \\#1. PayPal Bans - Have you heard those stories? People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage. What does this truly mean? This means most of it's revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention. \\#2. Mark Grether - **PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026. I'm getting emails.** The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform. However, PayPal made a huge mistake here not making this the main focus. Who is Mark? Well, in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon. Amazon then took it's ad unit from $10B to $30B in revenue. Uber hired Mark. In 2022 to 2024, Mark took Uber's ad business to $0 to $1B in revenue. What is PayPals Ad Manager? Let's act as if this was my own website. My post will get thousands of clicks but no monetization. Now, with PayPal ads, I can integrate their SDK into my website, and within minutes start running ads on this post. (Not this actual post but if it was my site) This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars. For example, if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $2B revenue at 50% margins, they would go from $5-6B net income, to $6-7B net income, and slowly go higher overtime. This is the setup the stock needs to go $100+ \\#3. PayPal Integrations - People seem to forget, PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal. This means users/businesses all get free advertising to PayPal. No matter what, naturally PayPal will grow for the next 5-10 years. Does it need more social growth? People choosing to actually want it? Yes. As an online business, if I'm not accepting PayPal I'm at a huge disadvantage. People use PayPal for their chargeback protection. I'm confident anytime I buy with PayPal I'm protected. Side Note: PayPal's and Venmo's cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet. **The moat remains in ads. PayPal's entire focus needs to shift to running ads.** **Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years, to sell now, ask yourself, why? PayPal ads release in early 2026. This is the product that will drive growth. We haven't even seen it yet.**",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive heard it all Value Trap Dying business Competition Lets start from the $ 310 price it was in 2021 . There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high . That puts PayPal close to a $ 300B valuation with $ 4B net income . It was trading for 80X earnings . Lets talk about the positives 1 . PayPal Bans Have you heard those stories People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage . What does this truly mean This means most of its revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention . 2 . Mark Grether PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026 . Im getting emails . The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform . However PayPal made a huge mistake here not_making this the main focus . Who is Mark Well in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon . Amazon then took its ad unit from $ 10B to $ 30B in revenue . Uber hired Mark . In 2022 to 2024 Mark took Ubers ad business to $ 0 to $ 1B in revenue . What is PayPals Ad Manager Lets act as if this was my own website . My post will get thousands of clicks but no_monetization . Now with PayPal ads I can integrate their SDK into my website and within minutes start running ads on this post . Not this actual post but if it was my site This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars . For example if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $ 2B revenue at 50 % margins they would go from $ 56B net income to $ 67B net income and slowly go higher overtime . This is the setup the stock needs to go $ 100 3 . PayPal Integrations People seem to forget PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal . This means usersbusinesses all get free advertising to PayPal . No_matter what naturally PayPal will grow for the next 510 years . Does it need more social growth People choosing to actually want it Yes . As an online business if Im not_accepting PayPal Im at a huge disadvantage . People use PayPal for their chargeback protection . Im confident anytime I buy with PayPal Im protected . Side Note PayPals and Venmos cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet . The moat remains in ads . PayPals entire focus needs to shift to running ads . Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years to sell now ask yourself why PayPal ads release in early 2026 . This is the product that will drive growth . We havent even seen it yet ."

      "selftext": "Carvana stock has plummeted from its recent $490 high to just $369 as of midday February 5 2026 Many people have never heard Bridgecrest before, and don’t understand why they are the worst human beings on the planet, and how they are associated with Carvana. In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital, Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22% If you have never heard of Bridgecrest before, that is why. Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period. My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse. As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader, I’ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time. The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150,000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax. And he owed $15,800 to Bridgecrest on a $4,000 car. After a short conversation with him, I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap. All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount. After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest, a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff, but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote. This is highly unusual for a bank, as most banks would want to receive the $15,800. They were owed in a timely manner and not have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number. How does this tie in the Carvana stock? Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana, owned through shady, backdoor dealings. And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying. Full disclosure. I am not a financial professional. This is not financial advice. Position disclosure: I have Current open short positions against Carvana. I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock, though it may open and close additional positions at any time.",

In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22 % If you have never_heard of Bridgecrest before that is why . Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period . My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse . As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader I ’ ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time . The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax . And he owed $ 15800 to Bridgecrest on a $ 4000 car . After a short conversation with him I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap . All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount . After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote . This is highly unusual for a bank as most banks would want to receive the $ 15800 . They were owed in a timely manner and not_have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number . How does this tie in the Carvana stock Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana owned through shady backdoor dealings . And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying . Full disclosure . I am not_a financial professional . This is not_financial advice . Position disclosure I have Current open short positions against Carvana . I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock though it may open and close additional positions at any time ."

I posted about it here: Back then, people called my investment terrible. Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no government support. But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis. Instead of liquidating everything, I added even more shares. I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce. That day has finally come. I’ve now turned that $40k loss into about +$200k gains including options. I did take profits on my June and $60 Jan calls this morning, but I’m still holding my $35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares. I believe solar is the future, and $ENPH is the leader in this space. I won’t lie, this trade drained me mentally. But days like today make it worth it. I earned this one. Cheers to ENPH shareholders, we deserve this victory today.",

I posted about it here Back then people called my investment terrible . Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no_government support . But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis . Instead of liquidating everything I added even more shares . I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce . That day has finally come . I ’ ve now turned that $ 40k loss into about $ 200k gains including options . I did take profits on my June and $ 60 Jan calls this morning but I ’ m still holding my $ 35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares . I believe solar is the future and $ ENPH is the leader in this space . I won ’ t lie this trade drained me mentally . But days like today make it worth it . I earned this one . Cheers to ENPH shareholders we deserve this victory today ."

I imagine it's related to recent US-Iran tension, but I haven't found any definitive information on major news channels. It looks like there was a crude oil drawdown in the US based on the latest EIA weekly petroleum status report, but it doesn't seem to justify such a price bump. \\[EDIT\\] The spike is likely due to collapsing talks between the US and Iran that were scheduled to occur on Friday.

      "selftext": "In February tech has largely been getting slaughtered, so I thought I’d zoom us all out to new years when these are the top 15 stocks hyped on Reddit to add to their portfolios. Almost every single one of these stocks, except for GOOG and MU, are significantly down from their 2026 start. We can take away a couple things. 1) reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks; clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence. 2) Redditors fail to follow a buying plan, if they had one to begin with, when their favorite stock dips 20-30%. Institutions on the other hand, force selling action on retailers, then buy at their planned price! That’s why they win out. I for one, am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip. I hope yall join me! Feel free to ask me what I’m buying and I’m staying clear of. 1: RKLB • 2 ASTS • ⁠3 AMZN • ⁠4 NBIS • ⁠5 GOOGL • ⁠6 RDDT • ⁠7 MU • ⁠8 SOFI • ⁠9 POET • ⁠10 AMD • ⁠11 IREN • ⁠12 HOOD • ⁠13 RIVN • ⁠14 NVDA • ⁠15 ONDS",

Almost every single one of these stocks except for GOOG and MU are significantly down from their 2026 start . We can take away a couple things . 1 reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence . 2 Redditors fail to follow a buying plan if they had one to begin with when their favorite stock dips 2030 % . Institutions on the other hand force selling action on retailers then buy at their planned price That ’ s why they win out . I for one am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip .

      "selftext": "Vindicated? I think so, and if I'm right it means you shouldn't go long in RDDT. In the early 2020s I thought to myself that if RDDT ever got listed I would short it but didn't notice it listed until a year later. I noticed because of headlines about it plummeting under 200. I wrote that I was shocked to see it ever made it that high and that it would go below 100. I profited with an 80$ put to back that up (my first ever experiment with buying contracts.) As we all see RDDT, then surged back over 200 twice. And the fanboys (at least here in reddit) came out in droves. One even saying he steadily profits buying under 200 and selling over 200. Hope he didn't load up again after the third time. At first I asserted the initial decline was because reddit is a shitshow. The [pushback I got there]( was that advertisers on it are making money and that RDDT was only going to grow - hugely (as well as smug and smarmy replies.. as if they wished to confirm the shitshow aspect.) I hadn't researched the advertiser revenue yet, so I did. I can't go through all their balance sheets, but I read enough to learn how that works and it led me to surmise Advertisers can only make an educated guess, throw money at it, and then see how much (if any) new revenue can be tracked to that advertising expense. So I posted that's how the downfall would start; that eventually Advertisers would determine they don't make much from this platform, certainly not enough to keep pouring in good money after bad. Am I right? Certainly not as wrong as the wisecrackers wanted to think. Time always tells the truth. For RDDT I say that will be sooner than later, given Digg and Youtube impacts,such as this article mentions and [the cited analyst in it seems to be seeing what I was predicting](",

      "selftext_processed": "Vindicated I think so and if Im right it means you shouldnt go long in RDDT . In the early 2020s I thought to myself that if RDDT ever got listed I would short it but didnt notice it listed until a year later . I noticed because of headlines about it plummeting under 200 . I wrote that I was shocked to see it ever made it that high and that it would go below 100 . I profited with an 80 $ put to back that up my first ever experiment with buying contracts . As we all see RDDT then surged back over 200 twice . And the fanboys at least here in reddit came out in droves . One even saying he steadily profits buying under 200 and selling over 200 . Hope he didnt load up again after the third time . At first I asserted the initial decline was because reddit is a shitshow . The pushback I got there was that advertisers on it are making money and that RDDT was only going to grow hugely as well as smug and smarmy replies .. as if they wished to confirm the shitshow aspect . I hadnt researched the advertiser revenue yet so I did . I cant go through all their balance sheets but I read enough to learn how that works and it led me to surmise Advertisers can only make an educated guess throw money at it and then see how much if any new revenue can be tracked to that advertising expense . So I posted thats how the downfall would start that eventually Advertisers would determine they dont make much from this platform certainly not_enough to keep pouring in good money after bad . Am I right Certainly not_as wrong as the wisecrackers wanted to think . Time always tells the truth . For RDDT I say that will be sooner than later given Digg and Youtube impactssuch as this article mentions and the cited analyst in it seems to be seeing what I was predicting"

      "selftext": "Picked up ENPH Jan 2027 $100 calls back in October when solar was completely hated. Stock had been crushed for months, everyone was calling it dead money, margins were collapsing, demand falling off a cliff, etc. Basically peak pessimism. I’m up about 143% overall now and today alone was a big rip, but I’m still holding. Reason is pretty simple: most of the bad news is already priced in. ENPH went from a market darling to a total punching bag. At \\~$50, you’re looking at a stock that’s been repriced for a worst-case scenario that doesn’t need to reverse much for upside to show up. Solar is extremely rate-sensitive and we’re getting closer to the part of the cycle where rates actually start helping instead of hurting. Even a modest pickup in residential demand changes the narrative fast. ENPH also isn’t some garbage balance sheet company — they’ve got cash, solid tech, and they’ll still be standing when weaker players wash out. Another thing people aren’t really talking about enough is short interest. This name is crowded on the short side. Solar in general is one of the most hated trades out there. If earnings or guidance come in even slightly better than feared, shorts are going to have to cover, and this thing can move way faster than people expect. These are 2027 LEAPS so I’m not trying to time a perfect bottom. If ENPH just mean-reverts part of the way back over the next year or two, the payoff is there. I don’t need it to go back to ATHs for this to work. Not advice, just sharing the trade. Curious if anyone else is still watching solar or thinks this move is just a dead-cat bounce.",

And have around 40% YOY revenue growth 105% customer retention (which means they keep all their customers and add every quarter) CEO has an incentive plan like Elon where he only makes big $$ if the Figma stock price hits certain hurdles. (Like $60,$80, etc) Google bought shares of Figma around $65 a few months ago. Figma also has a AI product called Figma Make. U can try it for free just type Figma Make on google and you are able to just type and create a full website/app. It’s insane and the most impressive AI I’ve probably ever used. The collaborative design market is expected to grow massively over the next 10 years. Around 30% a year on average. Figma has ridiculously high margins that we’ve seen come down from 90s to 80s because they spend so much on AI R&D. But, I’m okay with this. I want them to continue being absolutely cutting edge Collaborative design is the best way to optimize workflow. The ceo can follow the UI/UX designer while the engineer follows and work together in live time which speed up workflow. I think around 90% of the s&p 500 uses Figma. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber etc all use Figma. Figma is the buy of the century. Holding 29,144 shares at $21.10 This is not financial advise. Just my opinion",

      "selftext": "Yesterday’s market saw major indices decline, with Tech and Semis leading losses. A significant factor was renewed \"AI Displacement\" fears hitting the Software sector hard, impacting everything from Gaming to Cybersecurity with notable sell volume. Despite this, broader sector rotation is active; Small Caps (IWM) closed green, and thematic sectors like Nuclear and Space showed relative strength. The outlook suggests continued pressure on Tech today, fueled by AMD earnings and Nvidia’s H200 sales to China facing hurdles. We may be at a pivot point: potentially seeing rotation from outperforming Semis (profit-taking) into heavily beaten-down Software (bottom fishing). This narrative is complex, with NVIDIA nearing a $20B investment in OpenAI, signaling continued long-term commitment despite near-term jitters. This dynamic could shape short-to-medium term market movements. Disclosure: This content is for educational discussion purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

Lilly last ⁠year became the ‌first pharmaceutical company to hit a $ 1 trillion valuation driven by the ‍popularity of its blockbuster weightloss drug Zepbound and a rapidly expanding obesity market that is shifting ​toward cashpay options and telehealth channels . Lillys ‌upbeat outlook stands in sharp contrast to that of rival Novo Nordisk which has warned of unprecedented price pressures in 2026 after rattling investors with a forecast for a ⁠steep sales drop this ​year . For the reported quarter ​the drugmaker reported a profit of $ 7.54 per share . Analysts were expecting $ 6.67 according ‍to data ⁠compiled by LSEG . Lilly expects to earn $ 33.50 to $ 35 per share on an adjusted basis ⁠this year above analysts average estimate of $ 33.23 per ‌share ."

      "selftext": "My primary concern is government regulations. Could the minimum age regulation have affected them more negatively than anticipated a quarter ago when they sent to investors issuing a warning that they expected Q4 to be affected by government regulations? One more concern: they will join the crowd in saying AI somehow causes a lot of expenses for them. Final concern: they miss on all estimates. The last time the stock traded for less than $6 was in 2018. Back then, they had 188 million daily active users. Most recently they reported 477 million daily users. I say again: $6 for 477 million daily users versus $5 for 188 million daily users EIGHT YEARS ago. For all of 2025, $7 seemed to be the absolute floor. When they reported Q3, the stock surged to $9. No news since then… but now it trades for $6? Little downside - because even if it goes to $5s then I highly anticipate a quick recovery back to $6a. Would $5 be unheard of? As for the past seven years, yes. As for upside - even if it jumps 20 % the stock will merely be back to where it was two weeks ago. Would that be unheard of? Hardly. On a final note I just want to add that I was dead certain PayPal wouldn’t fall more than 5-10 % on earnings but the stock ended up falling 20 %. I held near 3,000 shares and sold yesterday to take a $30k loss. So, don’t take my advice. Call it wishful thinking- but I am 100 % SNAP in my portfolio now. Might be in for a double whammy. Might be in for a quick redemption from yesterday’s PYPL bloodbath.",

      "selftext_processed": "My primary concern is government regulations . Could the minimum age regulation have affected them more negatively than anticipated a quarter ago when they sent to investors issuing a warning that they expected Q4 to be affected by government regulations One more concern they will join the crowd in saying AI somehow causes a lot of expenses for them . Final concern they miss on all estimates . The last time the stock traded for less than $ 6 was in 2018 . Back then they had 188 million daily active users . Most recently they reported 477 million daily users . I say again $ 6 for 477 million daily users versus $ 5 for 188 million daily users EIGHT YEARS ago . For all of 2025 $ 7 seemed to be the absolute floor . When they reported Q3 the stock surged to $ 9 . No_news since then… but now it trades for $ 6 Little downside because even if it goes to $ 5s then I highly anticipate a quick recovery back to $ 6a . Would $ 5 be unheard of As for the past seven years yes . As for upside even if it jumps 20 % the stock will merely be back to where it was two weeks ago . Would that be unheard of Hardly . On a final note I just want to add that I was dead certain PayPal wouldn ’ t fall more than 510 % on earnings but the stock ended up falling 20 % . I held near 3000 shares and sold yesterday to take a $ 30k loss . So don ’ t take my advice . Call it wishful thinking but I am 100 % SNAP in my portfolio now . Might be in for a double whammy . Might be in for a quick redemption from yesterday ’ s PYPL bloodbath ."

      "title": "Why It Feels Like Everyone Is Making Money in Markets (Survivorship Bias)",
      "selftext": "When you look at investing and trading communities, profit posts stand out the most. It can easily feel like everyone is making money. But what we are seeing is already a heavily filtered picture. This is a classic case of survivorship bias. Even if only a small percentage of people actually succeed, that small group is the one that speaks. They post their results, share screenshots, and tell their stories. Those stories get repeated and spread until they start to look like the normal outcome. Meanwhile, most of the people who lost money say nothing. They quietly disappear from the same communities. So the information we see becomes biased toward a small group of survivors. In psychology and behavioral economics, this distortion is called survivorship bias. It is dangerous in markets because it makes people focus on stories instead of outcomes over time. In investing, what matters more than “how much you made” is “how long you stayed in the game.” Once survivorship bias takes hold, people start thinking like this: “That person made several times their money, so maybe I can too.” What we rarely see is how many people tried the same approach, how many failed, or how much of the result was luck rather than skill. As a result, high-risk strategies often look far more attractive than they really are. So what should we look at instead? Not “who made the most money,” but how many people were able to survive using the same method over time. Any strategy can produce a few success stories. The real question is whether it keeps working as time goes on. A slowly growing account contains far more information than one that rose quickly. And the more desperate someone feels, the easier it is to fall into this bias. The more urgently you want results, the more your attention is drawn to extreme success stories. At moments like this, you should be more careful and more cautious, not more aggressive. When you invest in a rush, emotion takes the lead, and the result often ends in ruin. So when you feel pressured to hurry, the important question is not how much you can make, but how long you can last. Before thinking, “Maybe I can be the next success story,” it may be more realistic to ask: “How many people actually stayed in the game using this approach?”",

      "title": "Why I'm Betting (Relatively) Big on IPOs This Year - DD?",
      "selftext": "We've all heard of the massive IPOs due (hopefully) sometime this year, and with all the recent/accumulated hype around AI/SpaceTech companies, I think we should follow where the smart money goes. First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund, **Founders Fund:** They have major holdings/stakes in both **OpenAI** and notably **SpaceX,** with a massive **$1B** investment in late 2025 into **OpenAI** and total investments upwards of **$600-$700M** in **SpaceX,** which alone is worth over **$80 billion** as of today, and considering the fund has an **AUM** of **$17 billion** and **total realized/unrealized portfolio** of **\\~$200 billion,** a conservative estimate IPO of **$1.5T** will likely more than double their unrealized stake in **SpaceX** and combined with **OpenAI's** IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund. Now I'll mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated won't be a part of: **Anthropic. Co:** Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI, I think you all know **Anthropic** has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO, you cannot miss out on this one. Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion, **Low-risk/High-return Tickers** that directly stand to gain from the IPOs: 1. $SATS - SpaceX With around **45-50%** of their mkt cap in **SpaceX** shares, roughly **$10\\~$11B,** this ticker stands to gain the most from the **SpaceX** IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV, all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into **$DTECH** or **$RKLB.** 2. $MSFT - OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock, but it's all about to change for the better (for calls) in 2026. I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of \\~$540 and all I can see is **unlimited upside at a 23% discount.** With an **absurd 27% ownership stake in OpenAI,** even if Altman shit himself on live tv you'll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up. 3. $SKM - Anthropic If you want exposure to **Anthropic. Co,** look no further than **$SKM**, a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry, merely a subdivision of their parent company SK, one of the country's largest chaebols. With a dominance of **50.5 of all shares** in their local market, **$SKM** is a solid investment even without their major stakes in **Anthropic. Co.** A monopoly in their industry at a relative all-time low is a great investment nonetheless, but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings. **They hold an ownership stake of approximately** **0.58%\\~0.7%,** which may not seem like a lot, but relative to their **\\~$9B mkt cap**, it makes up a significant portion of **$SKM's valuation at around 20%-25% of the company.** They've also got a joint partnership with **Anthropic,** together developing a **Multilingual LLM** tailored for the telecommunications industry. The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on, and the general public knows little to nothing about **Anthropic or their projects with SKM**, so we are early investors here. And, if you look at their Ytd/1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming. my current positions are: $SATS: +1 contracts of $9.80 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $160 $MSFT: +2 contracts of $4.90 ac Expiry - 11/20 pt $600 $SKM: +5 contracts of $1.89 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $41 **Tldr; If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no downside risk load up on $sats, $msft, $skm;** **Calls, don't be a pussy**",

      "selftext_processed": "Weve all heard of the massive IPOs due hopefully sometime this year and with all the recentaccumulated hype around AISpaceTech companies I think we should follow where the smart money goes . First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund Founders Fund They have major holdingsstakes in both OpenAI and notably SpaceX with a massive $ 1B investment in late 2025 into OpenAI and total investments upwards of $ 600 $ 700M in SpaceX which alone is worth over $ 80 billion as of today and considering the fund has an AUM of $ 17 billion and total realizedunrealized portfolio of $ 200 billion a conservative estimate IPO of $ 1.5T will likely more than double their unrealized stake in SpaceX and combined with OpenAIs IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund . Now Ill mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated wont be a part of Anthropic . Co Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI I think you all know Anthropic has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO you can not miss out on this one . Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion LowriskHighreturn Tickers that directly stand to gain from the IPOs 1 . $ SATS SpaceX With around 4550 % of their mkt cap in SpaceX shares roughly $ 10 $ 11B this ticker stands to gain the most from the SpaceX IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into $ DTECH or $ RKLB . 2 . $ MSFT OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock but its all about to change for the better for calls in 2026 . I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of $ 540 and all I can see is unlimited upside at a 23 % discount . With an absurd 27 % ownership stake in OpenAI even if Altman shit himself on live tv youll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up . 3 . $ SKM Anthropic If you want exposure to Anthropic . Co look no_further than $ SKM a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry merely a subdivision of their parent company SK one of the countrys largest chaebols . With a dominance of 50.5 of all shares in their local market $ SKM is a solid investment even without their major stakes in Anthropic . Co. A monopoly in their industry at a relative alltime low is a great investment nonetheless but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings . They hold an ownership stake of approximately 0.58 % 0.7 % which may not_seem like a lot but relative to their $ 9B mkt cap it makes up a significant portion of $ SKMs valuation at around 20 % 25 % of the company . Theyve also got a joint partnership with Anthropic together developing a Multilingual LLM tailored for the telecommunications industry . The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on and the general public knows little to nothing_about Anthropic or their projects with SKM so we are early investors here . And if you look at their Ytd1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming . my current positions are $ SATS 1 contracts of $ 9.80 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 160 $ MSFT 2 contracts of $ 4.90 ac Expiry 1120 pt $ 600 $ SKM 5 contracts of $ 1.89 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 41 Tldr If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no_downside risk load up on $ sats $ msft $ skm Calls dont be a pussy"

      "selftext": "Ok. Let's think about this logically. Wallstreet hammers SaaS companies. They think it's now much easier to create software. A team of 10 software engineers can now do the work of 100 software engineers. This makes SaaS moats easier to break. You can recreate most of the value of a SaaS with a small team of developers. Competition for SaaS will be intense in the coming years and pricing power for SaaS will be eroded. I happen to agree with that. I'm a software engineer and the productivity gain I experienced in the last 5 months is nothing short of scary good. I personally wouldn't invest in any SaaS company right now. I'm not saying SaaS has no value anymore. I'm saying they should no longer command the high PE ratios that they have historically enjoyed over the broader market. Ok so if SaaS companies are getting hammered, surely it will rotate to the companies responsible for getting the SaaS companies hammered, right? The companies who profit must be the ones who are making AI chips, data centers, and providing energy. Right? Nope. TSMC hammered. Nvidia hammered. Amazon (AWS) hammered. Broadcom hammered. This doesn't make any sense. Buy the dip on hardware companies if you think SaaS company moats will break easily caused by AI.",

      "selftext": "I know, I know. \"Catching a falling knife.\" I bought in at **$58**, so looking at the ticker today at **$42** (-20% drop) stings. The earnings were ugly: Revenue missed, branded checkout slowed to a crawl, and the guidance was flat. But the market is panic-selling the headline and missing the actual story: **The Board just brought in a \"Shareholder Return\" mercenary.** **1. The \"Alex Chriss\" Era is Over** Alex Chriss is out. The board appointed **Enrique Lores** (effective March 1), the former CEO of HP. Why does this matter? At HP, Lores wasn't a \"growth at all costs\" guy. He was a financial engineer who aggressively used free cash flow to buy back stock. The Board didn't hire him to invent a new button; they hired him to engineer the EPS. **2. The \"Death Spiral\" Stress Test** I updated my valuation model this morning to be brutally honest. I removed all the analyst \"growth\" fluff. I assumed PayPal is a melting ice cube. I modeled revenue and earnings **shrinking -5% every year** forever. **The Math at $42/share:** * **Free Cash Flow Yield:** \\~11-12% (based on \\~$6B FCF). * **The \"Cannibal\" Effect:** If the business shrinks 5%, but they use that massive cash pile to buy back stock at these depressed prices, they can retire \\~10-12% of the float per year. **The Equation:** 12% Buyback Yield - 5% Business Decay = **+7% Growth Per Share.** You are mathematically winning even if the company is losing. That is the safety margin at 8.5x earnings. **3. The Verdict** This isn't a growth stock anymore. It’s a \"Cannibal\" stock. The market is pricing it like it's going bankrupt (0.2x Debt/EBITDA says otherwise). With a new CEO known for discipline and a double-digit FCF yield, I think this is maximum pessimism. **My Move:** I’m not selling my $58 bag. I’m lowering my cost basis. The business might be stagnant, but at $42, the math is too loud to ignore. **Positions:** Long PYPL (Avg $58).",

The earnings were ugly Revenue missed branded checkout slowed to a crawl and the guidance was flat . But the market is panicselling the headline and missing the actual story The Board just brought in a Shareholder Return mercenary . 1 . The Alex Chriss Era is Over Alex Chriss is out . The board appointed Enrique Lores effective March 1 the former CEO of HP . Why does this matter At HP Lores wasnt a growth at all costs guy . He was a financial engineer who aggressively used free cash flow to buy back stock . The Board didnt hire him to invent a new button they hired him to engineer the EPS . 2 . The Death Spiral Stress Test I updated my valuation model this morning to be brutally honest . I removed all the analyst growth fluff . I assumed PayPal is a melting ice cube . I modeled revenue and earnings shrinking 5 % every year forever . The Math at $ 42share Free Cash Flow Yield 1112 % based on $ 6B FCF . The Cannibal Effect If the business shrinks 5 % but they use that massive cash pile to buy back stock at these depressed prices they can retire 1012 % of the float per year . The Equation 12 % Buyback Yield 5 % Business Decay 7 % Growth Per Share . You are mathematically winning even if the company is losing . That is the safety margin at 8.5x earnings . 3 . The Verdict This isnt a growth stock anymore . It ’ s a Cannibal stock . The market is pricing it like its going bankrupt 0.2x DebtEBITDA says otherwise . With a new CEO known for discipline and a doubledigit FCF yield I think this is maximum pessimism . My Move I ’ m not_selling my $ 58 bag . I ’ m lowering my cost basis . The business might be stagnant but at $ 42 the math is too loud to ignore . Positions Long PYPL Avg $ 58 ."

      "title": "Upcoming IPO No one is talking about: Forgent Power (FPS) 2/5/26",
      "selftext": "Been digging into this one since the S-1 (link [here]( dropped and wanted to share my notes for the upcoming IPO this week. They make electrical distribution equipment - transformers, switchgear, PDUs, power skids, the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers. Not sexy but completely essential. Every data center, every utility substation, every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff. FY25 revenue: $753M (up 56% YoY) Adjusted EBITDA: $169M (22.5% margin) Adjusted net income: $88.7M Backlog: $1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $283M revenue which is 84% growth. The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility. One thing I noticed - they lead with adjusted figures everywhere. GAAP net income isn't prominently disclosed which usually means there's a meaningful gap. They're adjusting out amortization from acquisitions, sponsor fees, integration costs, stock comp, etc. The adjustments are defensible given the situation but I'd like to see full GAAP figures. This is a PE roll-up. Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024: MGM Transformer (Oct 2023) PwrQ (March 2024) States Manufacturing (May 2024) VanTran (June 2024) So they've been operating as a combined entity for less than two years. Revenue breakdown: Data centers: 42% Grid/utilities: 23% Industrial: 19% Other: 16% By product type: Custom/engineered-to-order: 91% Standard products: 5% Services: 4% The custom work is where the margins are. They're not competing on price with commodity stuff. Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this, their largest comparable and another power infra company. He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv. That's probably the most relevant experience you could ask for - he's literally done this before with a similar business. CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment ($12B+ in revenue). So the management bench is legitimately experienced. As mentioned above, Vertiv is the big dog in data center power/cooling infrastructure, currently trading around $135 with a $50B+ market cap. Pros: * AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment * Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average * Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex * Management knows the space Cons: * This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity. * Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity. Less than 2 years of operating history together. * Valuation is rich for what's essentially a bet that the pieces fit together * Data center exposure cuts both ways. If AI capex slows down they're exposed.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into this one since the S1 link here dropped and wanted to share my notes for the upcoming IPO this week . They make electrical distribution equipment transformers switchgear PDUs power skids the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers . Not_sexy but completely essential . Every data center every utility substation every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff . FY25 revenue $ 753M up 56 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 169M 22.5 % margin Adjusted net income $ 88.7M Backlog $ 1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $ 283M revenue which is 84 % growth . The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility . One thing I noticed they lead with adjusted figures everywhere . GAAP net income isnt prominently disclosed which usually means theres a meaningful gap . Theyre adjusting out amortization from acquisitions sponsor fees integration costs stock comp etc . The adjustments are defensible given the situation but Id like to see full GAAP figures . This is a PE rollup . Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024 MGM Transformer Oct 2023 PwrQ March 2024 States Manufacturing May 2024 VanTran June 2024 So theyve been operating as a combined entity for less than two years . Revenue breakdown Data centers 42 % Gridutilities 23 % Industrial 19 % Other 16 % By product type Customengineeredtoorder 91 % Standard products 5 % Services 4 % The custom work is where the margins are . Theyre not_competing on price with commodity stuff . Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this their largest comparable and another power infra company . He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv . Thats probably the most relevant experience you could ask for hes literally done this before with a similar business . CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment $ 12B in revenue . So the management bench is legitimately experienced . As mentioned above Vertiv is the big dog in data center powercooling infrastructure currently trading around $ 135 with a $ 50B market cap . Pros AI buildout grid modernization manufacturing reshoring all of this requires electrical equipment Supply constrained market . Lead times for this stuff can be 24 years from some suppliers . Forgent claims their lead times are 3065 % shorter than industry average Capacity expansion almost done . Theyve invested $ 205M to expand manufacturing should support up to $ 5B in revenue without major additional capex Management knows the space Cons This is a PE exit . 70 % of the IPO is secondary existing shareholders cashing out . Only 30 % is primary shares with proceeds going to the company . Neos wants liquidity . Rollup risk . Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity . Less than 2 years of operating history together . Valuation is rich for whats essentially a bet that the pieces fit together Data center exposure cuts both ways . If AI capex slows down theyre exposed ."

      "selftext": "Currently, VOO makes up the largest position in my portfolio. However, I'm a non-American investing from outside, and I'm losing confidence in the US for obvious reasons. From an ethical standpoint, I also don't feel like continuing to invest in American companies when America is actively threatening and bullying other countries, including my own. Why should I contribute to an economy that is causing so much harm not only to itself but also the rest of the world? As I'm not a US citizen and have zero ties to the US, I'm thinking now might be a good time to sell all my VOO shares and convert them to VXUS instead, since I see international markets outperforming the US for at least the next few years. I don't have to pay capital gains where I live, so tax is a non-issue for me. Would it be OK to just go all-in on VXUS, or is this a bad idea?",

      "selftext": "We have seen what is happening in SaaS with Disney and Auto recently and it’s something Clayton Christianson warned about decades ago. The Innovators dilemma is when a legacy cash cow business is being up ended by a less profitable but obvious future. With Disney it was and is cable to streaming with cars it was ICE to EVs and with software it’s per user pricing to usage based licensing. As AI takes hold it will kill the user model and likely be replaced with usage models or per user models with a smaller workforce. Either way you have a shrinking legacy book and new AI platforms that are likely to be more competitive. If you look at stocks that go through this transition, the performance is generally not good. The legacy leader going through the transition almost always underperforms the pure play new leader. DIS Vs NFLX F,GM vs TSLA With this in mind I’d bet accordingly",

The Innovators dilemma is when a legacy cash cow business is being up ended by a less profitable but obvious future . With Disney it was and is cable to streaming with cars it was ICE to EVs and with software it ’ s per user pricing to usage based licensing . As AI takes hold it will kill the user model and likely be replaced with usage models or per user models with a smaller workforce . Either way you have a shrinking legacy book and new AI platforms that are likely to be more competitive . If you look at stocks that go through this transition the performance is generally not_good . The legacy leader going through the transition almost always underperforms the pure play new leader . DIS Vs NFLX FGM vs TSLA With this in mind I ’ d bet accordingly"

      "selftext": "I've been looking on with interest at a bunch of SaaS stocks for a while now (Constellation, Intuit, Atlassian, Toast, Salesforce) as they fell on the 'AI will kill every SaaS company' narrative starting to gain momentum. I think it's safe to say that that whole 'SaaS extinction event' narrative has basically gone from 'scary idea' to 'accepted wisdom' by the market at this point given the magnitude of the moves today after Anthropic dropped their latest tool and everyone freaked out. I'm not saying that's right, the markets frequently get it wrong, just commenting on the price moves. I'm trying to figure out what to do here. Option A would be begin to buy these SaaS companies that have large customer bases, recurring revenue and a long history. Doing that sort of requires a belief that they'll integrate AI into their products 'on the run' while fending of the 'pure' AI companies and their abilities. They might fall more in the next months / years so doing this also would require a fair bit of patience and ability to tolerate that pain. Option B would be to not buy at all, continue to watch as the market sorts out the winners and losers. This would be based on a belief that AI is actually going to cause most of these companies to either lose a bunch of users or that it will compress their margins so far that they'll become unattractive investments but that it's impossible to tell which at this point. Option C would be to wait on the 'AI bubble' popping because if that happens, all tech will be indiscriminately sold down (whether it's AI or SaaS) for a while. Doing that means a belief that the AI capabilities of the AI companies are overstated and that the SaaS companies will be fine in the long term as they integrate the helpful AI tools and keep their users. I have no idea on whether that's true or not (and no one else really seems to either, but the moves today seem to suggest there's more in the 'AI will change everything' camp than the 'AI is a bubble one'). Edit: Woah, this has blown up and there's some insanely good takes in the comments from people actually in the industry and stuff. I might expand the post and then incorporate the best of the feedback and format it properly then post the whole deep dive to my profile (probs too long for a sub post) so feel free to follow there if you want to see it.",

      "selftext": "For the last decade, the mantra has been \"Software is eating the world.\" But as we enter 2026, the power dynamic has fundamentally shifted. While the world's focus remains on the \"ghost in the machine\" - the in AI, the algorithms, and the code - the real leverage has migrated back to the Physical Bits: the critical atoms that make the digital revolution possible. My investment thesis is built on three pillars of Scarcity, Energy, and Sovereignty: **1. The Energy Chokepoint (Uranium)** AI is the most energy-intensive technology in human history. We have reached a point where \"code\" is limited by \"current.\" You cannot run a global intelligence network on intermittent power; it requires the massive, carbon-free energy density that only Uranium can provide. By holding CCJ and UUUU, I am investing in the \"fuel\" for the AI era. In this hierarchy, the uranium atom is the ultimate \"bit\" of data center uptime. **2. The Kinetic Chokepoint (Rare Earths)** Software can think, but it cannot move without Rare Earth Elements (REEs). From the high-performance magnets in EV motors to the actuators in humanoid robotics, NdPr (Neodymium-Praseodymium) is the non-substitutable hardware that translates digital commands into physical motion. Through MP and LYSDY, I am positioned at the bottleneck of the \"Physical AI\" revolution. **3. The Geopolitical Moat** We are moving from a world of \"just-in-time\" globalism to a world of \"friend-shoring\" and resource nationalism. The value of these minerals is no longer just their market price; it is their provenance. By focusing on Western-aligned supply chains, I am betting on a \"Sovereignty Premium\" - the reality that a pound of uranium or a magnet produced in a secure, allied jurisdiction is worth significantly more than one controlled by a geopolitical rival. **The Bottom Line** In a world of infinite, replicable software, value naturally flows toward the finite and the non-substitutable. I will not invest in the companies that write the code, instead I’m choosing to invest in the companies that control the physical gatekeepers of the modern world. Tldr: I am long on the atoms that power the bits.",

While the worlds focus remains on the ghost in the machine the in AI the algorithms and the code the real leverage has migrated back to the Physical Bits the critical atoms that make the digital revolution possible . My investment thesis is built on three pillars of Scarcity Energy and Sovereignty 1 . The Energy Chokepoint Uranium AI is the most energyintensive technology in human history . We have reached a point where code is limited by current . You can not run a global intelligence network on intermittent power it requires the massive carbonfree energy density that only Uranium can provide . By holding CCJ and UUUU I am investing in the fuel for the AI era . In this hierarchy the uranium atom is the ultimate bit of data center uptime . 2 . The Kinetic Chokepoint Rare Earths Software can think but it can not move without Rare Earth Elements REEs . From the highperformance magnets in EV motors to the actuators in humanoid robotics NdPr NeodymiumPraseodymium is the nonsubstitutable hardware that translates digital commands into physical motion . Through MP and LYSDY I am positioned at the bottleneck of the Physical AI revolution . 3 . The Geopolitical Moat We are moving from a world of justintime globalism to a world of friendshoring and resource nationalism . The value of these minerals is no_longer just their market price it is their provenance . By focusing on Westernaligned supply chains I am betting on a Sovereignty Premium the reality that a pound of uranium or a magnet produced in a secure allied jurisdiction is worth significantly more than one controlled by a geopolitical rival . The Bottom Line In a world of infinite replicable software value naturally flows toward the finite and the nonsubstitutable . I will not_invest in the companies that write the code instead I ’ m choosing to invest in the companies that control the physical gatekeepers of the modern world . Tldr I am long on the atoms that power the bits ."

What I do is look on Yahoo finance for stocks with stead revenue, earnings and profit growth, low debt, good range P/E ratio and (if possible) PEG under 1. Is this a good way to find good undervalued growth investments or am I out of my mind? What do you guys do? Also, any suggestions on any undervalued growth investments that anyone may know of right now? Thanks",

      "selftext": "Energy production and green technology will be critical over the coming decades as technological growth accelerates. Ensuring reliable power delivery will require significant investment, and new breakthroughs are likely to emerge along the way. I have invested to some extent in a nuclear-focused ETF, as nuclear energy has strong potential for delivering efficient, large-scale power generation. That said, nuclear projects are complex, expensive, and slow to build, so widespread expansion is likely to take decades. Recently, I watched a compelling video on the use of supercritical CO₂ in energy systems, which appears to be a promising emerging technology. My goal is to gain exposure early, before it becomes widely discussed, while diversifying within the energy production sector. Energy demand is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades, and meeting that demand is already a major challenge. I am interested in ways to invest in this technology and other emerging energy solutions while avoiding the higher risk associated with individual stocks. I understand that the U.S. was previously seen as a leader in this area, but China brought a commercially successful supercritical CO₂ power plant online in late 2025, marking a significant milestone. I would welcome any thoughts or suggestions on investment approaches in this space. [Link to youtube video ](",

      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer thesis. I hold no position.** I’ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix’s latest guidance. If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022, you can officially burn that thesis. The Empire has struck back. They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade, effectively transitioning from a cash-burning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape. But here is the conflict: **I love the business. I respect the execution. But I hate the stock at these levels.** As a researcher, my job isn't to applaud the product, it's to price the risk. And right now, the market is pricing a \"Media Conglomerate\" like it’s still a \"SaaS Monopoly.\" Here is the why Netflix won but why I’m still sitting on my hands. **Part 1: Why I Like the Company (The \"Empire\" Thesis)** The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at \"Sub Count\" while Netflix was fixing the \"Plumbing.\" The Ad-Tier Was a Trojan Horse: The market treated the ad-tier as a desperate \"down-sell\" to stop churn. The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) expansion tool. Ad revenue surged 150% in 2025 and is projected to double again to $3B in 2026. They aren't just \"saving\" users; they are monetizing the \"freeloaders\" at a higher margin. Operational Excellence (The Margin Story): While legacy media (Disney, Paramount) is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes, Netflix has achieved \"Escape Velocity.\" They expanded operating margins to 27% in 2024 and are guiding for 29% in 2025. This is no longer a \"growth at all costs\" shop; it is a cash flow machine. The \"Default\" Utility: Netflix has effectively won the \"churn war.\" With over 300 million subscribers, it has become the global default for video consumption. In a recession, people cancel \"nice-to-haves\" (Starz, Discovery+); they keep the \"Utility\" (Netflix). **Part 2: The Trap (Why I’m NOT Buying)** This is where the \"Momentum\" crowd is about to get hurt. The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection (30x+ PE), but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody is discounting. **1. The WBD Elephant (The Valuation Breaker)** The rumored $83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros. Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis. The Re-Rating Risk: \"Tech Monopolies\" trade at 30x-40x PE. \"Media Conglomerates\" (like Comcast/Disney) trade at 15x-20x PE. If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP (Harry Potter, DC), they aren't just buying content; they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets. You cannot pay a premium \"Tech Multiple\" for a company that is becoming \"Cable Provider 2.0.\" The moment that deal ink dries, the multiple compression could be violent. **2. The \"One-Off\" Growth Illusion** A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown (Paid Sharing). This was a \"Step-Function\" increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once. The market is extrapolating that one-time revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend. Reality Check: We are hitting \"Subscription Saturation.\" The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin. The Verdict: Great Business, Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet. Right now, at near 52week lows, you are paying for: Flawless execution of the Ad-Tier. Zero friction in the WBD integration (if it happens). A \"Tech Premium\" on a \"Media\" business. That is Priced for Perfection. I am keeping my powder dry. I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a \"Media Utility,\" and the multiple compresses back to reality (\\~20x-25x earnings). **Further Discussion Points:** The Deal: If NFLX buys WBD, do you instantly re-rate them as a \"Legacy Media\" stock, or does the \"Tech Halo\" protect the multiple? Ad-Tier: Are you seeing the ad-tier actually cannibalize the premium plans, or is it truly additive? Valuation: Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at \\~12-15%, or is this just pure momentum?",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer thesis . I hold no_position . I ’ ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix ’ s latest guidance . If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022 you can officially burn that thesis . The Empire has struck back . They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade effectively transitioning from a cashburning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape . But here is the conflict I love the business . I respect the execution . But I hate the stock at these levels . As a researcher my job isnt to applaud the product its to price the risk . And right now the market is pricing a Media Conglomerate like it ’ s still a SaaS Monopoly . Here is the why Netflix won but why I ’ m still sitting on my hands . Part 1 Why I Like the Company The Empire Thesis The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at Sub Count while Netflix was fixing the Plumbing . The AdTier Was a Trojan Horse The market treated the adtier as a desperate downsell to stop churn . The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU Average Revenue Per User expansion tool . Ad revenue surged 150 % in 2025 and is projected to double again to $ 3B in 2026 . They arent just saving users they are monetizing the freeloaders at a higher margin . Operational Excellence The Margin Story While legacy media Disney Paramount is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes Netflix has achieved Escape Velocity . They expanded operating margins to 27 % in 2024 and are guiding for 29 % in 2025 . This is no_longer a growth at all costs shop it is a cash flow machine . The Default Utility Netflix has effectively won the churn war . With over 300 million subscribers it has become the global default for video consumption . In a recession people cancel nicetohaves Starz Discovery they keep the Utility Netflix . Part 2 The Trap Why I ’ m NOT_Buying This is where the Momentum crowd is about to get hurt . The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection 30x PE but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody_is discounting . 1 . The WBD Elephant The Valuation Breaker The rumored $ 83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros . Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis . The ReRating Risk Tech Monopolies trade at 30x40x PE . Media Conglomerates like ComcastDisney trade at 15x20x PE . If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP Harry Potter DC they arent just buying content they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets . You can not pay a premium Tech Multiple for a company that is becoming Cable Provider 2.0 . The moment that deal ink dries the multiple compression could be violent . 2 . The OneOff Growth Illusion A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown Paid Sharing . This was a StepFunction increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once . The market is extrapolating that onetime revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend . Reality Check We are hitting Subscription Saturation . The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin . The Verdict Great Business Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet . Right now at near 52week lows you are paying for Flawless execution of the AdTier . Zero friction in the WBD integration if it happens . A Tech Premium on a Media business . That is Priced for Perfection . I am keeping my powder dry . I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a Media Utility and the multiple compresses back to reality 20x25x earnings . Further Discussion Points The Deal If NFLX buys WBD do you instantly rerate them as a Legacy Media stock or does the Tech Halo protect the multiple AdTier Are you seeing the adtier actually cannibalize the premium plans or is it truly additive Valuation Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at 1215 % or is this just pure momentum"

      "selftext": "Astrology works because people see patterns, assign meaning, then interpret everything through that lens. Once the label exists, every outcome fits the story. Technical analysis can function similarly. Indicators matter because traders collectively watch them. Support holds because enough people expect it to. The reaction is often driven by shared belief, not inherent market physics. That works - until something external resets the system. A geopolitical shock, a policy surprise, a liquidity event. Suddenly price moves for reasons no indicator anticipated. The chart didn’t fail. The underlying assumptions did. Technical analysis isn’t useless. It’s a behavioral map. But it only works inside stable regimes where expectations are self-reinforcing. The problem starts when traders treat it as objective truth instead of conditional probability. Astrology becomes dangerous when it’s literal. Technical analysis becomes dangerous when it’s absolute. Markets tolerate tools. They punish certainty.",

      "selftext": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth. I'd define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on non-producing assets without an underlying, historical, or productive market value. Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone, can collapse when the faith vanishes, with nobody willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse. In fact, there's no concept of a 'bargain' for a bubble commodity. Once the faith is gone, the value is gone. Real wealth examples: * real estate that people live in, using money from jobs. Or functioning commercial real estate. * stocks with a historically non-insane PE (say, less than 25 or 30). Yes, there's an exception for genuine likelihood of growth. * gold at historical prices (gold is faith based, but it's 10,000 years of faith). * dollars, exchangeable for above, as long as inflation is sane. * Dutch tulips c. 1635; Beanie Babies c. 1995. Bubble wealth examples: * the part of gold price above its historical norm, say $2500 (ie, a bit over plateau before 2024). Gold's current bubble value would be $16T using total amount of gold in existence; but only 22% is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits, so maybe just $3T. * most of silver's current price, but most of silver is in non-investment form. Silver has a $5T total cap, but only 5% is held as coin or bullion, so ignore silver. * cryptocurrency. Current bubble value $2.6T, assuming all crypto is hokum. * the $3T of AI infrastructure build-up could be bubble wealth, in full or in part. * real estate used to park money, that could not be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition. Bubble value: very hard to guess; the total [value of real estate shot up from $30T to $50T after covid,( when CPI says it should have gone to 38T, so there's $12T of bubble value maybe, unless the increase of prices is fundamental. * stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA - I'd say TSLA is 90% bubble but hard to say for NVDA. 50%? Anyway, maybe $4T just for these, then a bunch of other stocks, at various bubble fractions. * one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 20-25 (?) and today's value of 30 is bubble wealth, so at least 20% of the US market ($14T) is bubble wealth, but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated, and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up, with bargain hunters waiting to pile on. So let's not count the high current P/E, or discount its bubbliness by a lot. The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly, however. So there seems to be at least $20T of faith-based wealth out there, perhaps 65% of US GDP. The stock market lost $8T (equivalent to $12T today) in 2008; it lost $5T ($10T today) in 2000. Housing lost something like $6T in 2008, suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of today's bubble wealth. Comments? Are we in a record era bubble wealth? Or is this the wrong way to look at things?",

      "selftext_processed": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth . Id define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on nonproducing assets without an underlying historical or productive market value . Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone can collapse when the faith vanishes with nobody_willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse . In fact theres no_concept of a bargain for a bubble commodity . Once the faith is gone the value is gone . Real wealth examples real estate that people live in using money from jobs . Or functioning commercial real estate . stocks with a historically noninsane PE say less than 25 or 30 . Yes theres an exception for genuine likelihood of growth . gold at historical prices gold is faith based but its 10000 years of faith . dollars exchangeable for above as long as inflation is sane . Dutch tulips c. 1635 Beanie Babies c. 1995 . Bubble wealth examples the part of gold price above its historical norm say $ 2500 ie a bit over plateau before 2024 . Golds current bubble value would be $ 16T using total amount of gold in existence but only 22 % is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits so maybe just $ 3T . most of silvers current price but most of silver is in noninvestment form . Silver has a $ 5T total cap but only 5 % is held as coin or bullion so ignore silver . cryptocurrency . Current bubble value $ 2.6T assuming all crypto is hokum . the $ 3T of AI infrastructure buildup could be bubble wealth in full or in part . real estate used to park money that could not_be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition . Bubble value very hard to guess the total value of real estate shot up from $ 30T to $ 50T after covid when CPI says it should have gone to 38T so theres $ 12T of bubble value maybe unless the increase of prices is fundamental . stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA Id say TSLA is 90 % bubble but hard to say for NVDA . 50 % Anyway maybe $ 4T just for these then a bunch of other stocks at various bubble fractions . one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 2025 and todays value of 30 is bubble wealth so at least 20 % of the US market $ 14T is bubble wealth but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up with bargain hunters waiting to pile on . So lets not_count the high current PE or discount its bubbliness by a lot . The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly however . So there seems to be at least $ 20T of faithbased wealth out there perhaps 65 % of US GDP . The stock market lost $ 8T equivalent to $ 12T today in 2008 it lost $ 5T $ 10T today in 2000 . Housing lost something like $ 6T in 2008 suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of todays bubble wealth . Comments Are we in a record era bubble wealth Or is this the wrong way to look at things"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Oracle Corp. plans to raise $45 billion to $50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI’s growth. >Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company’s largest cloud customers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp., OpenAI, TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp., the company said in a statement Sunday. >The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligence-linked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off. The company’s shares have fallen around 50% from its record price on Sept. 10, wiping out roughly $460 billion in market value. >Shares fell about 3% in premarket trading on Monday. Oracle’s stock had declined 2.6% to close at $164.58 in New York on Friday. >Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle’s free cash flow negative, where it is expected to stay until 2030, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years, largely on semiconductors and leases. >“If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. >The company plans to raise half of the funds via equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an at-the-market equity program of as much as $20 billion. >Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investment-grade debt rating, wrote John DiFucci, an analyst at Guggenheim, in a January note. >The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026. The company borrowed $18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year’s largest corporate bond offerings. >But the debt market may not have an appetite for this much investment-grade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps, Luria said. Issuing equity may also hurt the company’s stock price, he said. >Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering, Oracle said. >As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble, investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle, which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. >A key part of Oracle’s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI, which has committed to spending about $300 billion to rent servers from Oracle. OpenAI is not profitable, adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns. >Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle. The timing, “could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday’s open,” Luria said. *Processing img uc3th276y2hg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Oracle Corp. plans to raise $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI ’ s growth . Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company ’ s largest cloud customers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. Nvidia Corp. OpenAI TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp. the company said in a statement Sunday . The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligencelinked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off . The company ’ s shares have fallen around 50 % from its record price on Sept. 10 wiping out roughly $ 460 billion in market value . Shares fell about 3 % in premarket trading on Monday . Oracle ’ s stock had declined 2.6 % to close at $ 164.58 in New York on Friday . Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle ’ s free cash flow negative where it is expected to stay until 2030 according to data compiled by Bloomberg . The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years largely on semiconductors and leases . “ If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in ” said Gil Luria an analyst at DA Davidson Co . The company plans to raise half of the funds via equitylinked and common equity issuances including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an atthemarket equity program of as much as $ 20 billion . Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investmentgrade debt rating wrote John DiFucci an analyst at Guggenheim in a January note . The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026 . The company borrowed $ 18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year ’ s largest corporate bond offerings . But the debt market may not_have an appetite for this much investmentgrade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps Luria said . Issuing equity may also hurt the company ’ s stock price he said . Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the atthemarket issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering Oracle said . As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis . A key part of Oracle ’ s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI which has committed to spending about $ 300 billion to rent servers from Oracle . OpenAI is not_profitable adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns . Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle . The timing “ could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday ’ s open ” Luria said .

      "selftext": "BARK Inc., is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to go-private in a all-cash transaction. The first proposal: BARK stock started 2025 at $2 with a continuous drop until $0.60. The Co-Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $0.60 and pushed the stock price down. A few weeks later, the CEO with the insiders made a go-private offer at $0.90 per share. They control nearly 39% of BARK already. Their offer was a relief for some retail holders, as it was nearly 50% higher than the current sp then. But, it was actually a low-ball offer for a artificially beaten down stock. The second proposal: In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $0.90, another major shareholder, Shay Capital, criticized the management and made two proposals: First, its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors, Second, a stock buy-back up to $25 million, as in their opinion, BARK stock price at $0.90 was very undervalued. A few days later than the CEO/insiders proposal at $0.90, Klugman with Marcus Lemonis (CEO of BBBY) made their buyout proposal at $1.10 per share. (Remember, Klugman does not accept the $0.90. He stated that in October. Then he said the sp at $0.90 is too low). So, there are two parties, already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders, who will try to acquire the company. They are both serious: \\-CEO/insiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a low-ball offer following it. \\-Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis. \\-Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff, a pet firm with retail stores. He grew Bentley with many acquisitions. Bentley sell pet foods, but don't make its own. BARK is making pet foods, so the synergies between these two are obvious. Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH, acquiring/delisting a company, merged it, re-listing it again. I think it will take time, but during times of uncertainty, the potential of a 22% gain from Klugman-Lemonis offer and the secured CEO/insiders offer bring a great risk/reward ratio. BARK currently trades at $0.89 and it dropped even at $0.85. These prices are below both offers. The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $1.10. Until then, both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down. Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th, but they are not important anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "BARK Inc. is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to goprivate in a allcash transaction . The first proposal BARK stock started 2025 at $ 2 with a continuous drop until $ 0.60 . The CoFounder Executive Chairman CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $ 0.60 and pushed the stock price down . A few weeks later the CEO with the insiders made a goprivate offer at $ 0.90 per share . They control nearly 39 % of BARK already . Their offer was a relief for some retail holders as it was nearly 50 % higher than the current sp then . But it was actually a lowball offer for a artificially beaten down stock . The second proposal In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $ 0.90 another major shareholder Shay Capital criticized the management and made two proposals First its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors Second a stock buyback up to $ 25 million as in their opinion BARK stock price at $ 0.90 was very undervalued . A few days later than the CEOinsiders proposal at $ 0.90 Klugman with Marcus Lemonis CEO of BBBY made their buyout proposal at $ 1.10 per share . Remember Klugman does not_accept the $ 0.90 . He stated that in October . Then he said the sp at $ 0.90 is too low . So there are two parties already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders who will try to acquire the company . They are both serious CEOinsiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a lowball offer following it . Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis . Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff a pet firm with retail stores . He grew Bentley with many acquisitions . Bentley sell pet foods but dont make its own . BARK is making pet foods so the synergies between these two are obvious . Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH acquiringdelisting a company merged it relisting it again . I think it will take time but during times of uncertainty the potential of a 22 % gain from KlugmanLemonis offer and the secured CEOinsiders offer bring a great riskreward ratio . BARK currently trades at $ 0.89 and it dropped even at $ 0.85 . These prices are below both offers . The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $ 1.10 . Until then both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down . Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th but they are not_important anymore ."

Some news outlets are framing the Federal Reserve’s latest fed chef replacement proposal as evidence that the dollar is becoming significantly stronger. I find that misleading. Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn’t signal a strong dollar especially not merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place. What we need is real fiscal progress, not just new faces saying things are improving. I’m not convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem.

      "title": "TikTok's most popular influencer sold his company for $975m... to a sketchy Chinese \"printing\" company doing $6m in revenue: a write-up.",
      "selftext": "*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)* ***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.*** ***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.*** ***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.*** Hola fellow regards, If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.]( It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares. Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point. [Quite a return if you ask me.]( Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… # Rich Sparkle is a \"printing company\" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all. With a consideration of nearly $975 million dollars, most would think that Rich Sparkle is, in some way, a firm that’s engaged within the social media or technology space. Maybe an A.I influencer company or something? It’s what I thought too, but Rich Sparkle’s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements. Yes. Printing and designing financial statements. [Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th, 2025.]( A financial statements printing company is paying $975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok’s most popular influencer. What’s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they’re paying Khaby Lame for this company. The company only raked in just $5.88m in revenue the previous year, yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars? [Again, per the prospectus.]( [Listed on the prospectus, ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade.]( $ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th, 2025, raising just **$5m in IPO proceeds** [**(6-k pg.11)**]( The company issued out just 10% of their current shares, which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $50m come the time of the IPO (shares would eventually dilute out to \\~5% of outstanding shares being publicly traded). Just a month later, the stock that initially IPO'd at price of around $4 is trading at [$30 bucks and has added nearly $250m in market capitalization]( with literally no material events happening within that time that neither EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too. Inexplicably [the ticker just... stays in that price range for no real reason at all, no material events, nothing]( for the next few months. That changes on December 15th, 2025. [6-k on December 15th.]( The auditor for Rich Sparkle, Wei Wei & Co, resigned as Sparkle's auditor [effective immediately. ]( wouldn't be too much of a problem (for a company of their stature) if it weren't for the fact that the company has [filed notice that their 20-F is going to come late.]( The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only [one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn (who only has one follower), despite being an American company,]( and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with [zero followers]( and [filler posts that are just stock images]( I'm not one to want to cyberbully a small business, but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company (as of 2/1/26) that just did a $975m acquisition... yeah that's a bit sketchy. # The biggest IPO Sparkle's underwriter got involved in... was historic for all the wrong reasons. I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece I'm working on. This section is where I'll clear that up. The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money, would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares. [Per prospectus]( Eddid Securities. [Their website]( says that they help bring small to medium-size companies to the market, stuff the big investment banks don't have the time for. *Small to medium-size companies*, with the exception of one. [Ain't that a lovely throwback]( To any WSBers that were here during 2022, I'm sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you. Their subsidiary, Digital, randomly skyrocketed 30,000% within the span of mere weeks in July-August 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The only problem is that no one exactly knew how this was even possible, and no, it wasn't a meme stock as the media often claimed. AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kong-related stocks (Regencell, Addentax, etc) that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $400b+ at its peak only to dump 90% right after. The guy behind the IPO, Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO, and, a year and a half before, was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of China's biggest investment firms, CMIG. This feud was so public, CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a *fraudster they shouldn't invest with.* [one of us if I'm being real 😶‍🌫️]( While AMTD's stock surge still hasn't been publicly explained yet, it's pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider co-ordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola, Facebook, and Walmart (no I'm not joking) within the span of weeks. The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process? Looking at the underwriting records, where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process ([prospectus]( [Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022]( Of course, this isn't definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital, but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with, while also considering that $ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider co-ordination. AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC (Hong Kong's version of the SEC). They recently got fined for failing to [produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market.]( Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to \"*have lost records and books relating to the listing of multi-million dollar companies*\" # Conclusion. I'm not here to make any definitive claims, but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is, and that the media is not reporting on any of it, at all. With the clear influencer angle, and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has, I feel like it's hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that don't really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally *cooked*. Anyways, hope you enjoyed this write-up. I'm out.",

      "selftext_processed": "For disclosure I dont hold any position in $ ANPA nor do I plan to . I wrote this write up since I found it interesting and also intersects with other work Im doing TLDR Khaby Lame the mostfollowed creator on TikTok sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $ 6m in revenue ... yes this is real . A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publiclyknown employee and hardly any public presence . The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most highprofile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs . Simply put the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets . Hola fellow regards If you ’ ve been reading the news lately you might ’ ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok ’ s most followed creator Khaby Lame selling his name and likeness for just shy of a billion dollars . It ’ s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame ’ s success story . The laidoff machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars looks built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal . According to the SEC filing Khaby Lame sold Step Distinctive Limited from a Hong Kongbased holding company Rich Sparkle Limited for the consideration of $ 975m USD through the issuance of 75m ordinary shares of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive ’ s shareholders . No_cash got exchanged at all purely shares . Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ ANPA and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing up to 600 % from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point . Quite a return if you ask me . Yet take an actual dive into the company that ’ s acquiring Khaby ’ s company and more specifically who even underwrote them within the first place and you ’ re going to get a picture filled with so many redflags you ’ d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… Rich Sparkle is a printing company that has no_business making a deal of this nature ... like at all . With a consideration of nearly $ 975 million dollars most would think that Rich Sparkle is in some way a firm that ’ s engaged within the social media or technology space . Maybe an A.I influencer company or something It ’ s what I thought too but Rich Sparkle ’ s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements . Yes . Printing and designing financial statements . Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th 2025 . A financial statements printing company is paying $ 975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok ’ s most popular influencer . What ’ s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they ’ re paying Khaby Lame for this company . The company only raked in just $ 5.88m in revenue the previous year yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars Again per the prospectus . Listed on the prospectus ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade . $ ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th 2025 raising just $ 5m in IPO proceeds 6k pg.11 The company issued out just 10 % of their current shares which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $ 50m come the time of the IPO shares would eventually dilute out to 5 % of outstanding shares being publicly traded . Just a month later the stock that initially IPOd at price of around $ 4 is trading at $ 30 bucks and has added nearly $ 250m in market capitalization with literally no_material events happening within that time that neither_EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too . Inexplicably the ticker just ... stays in that price range for no_real reason at all no_material events nothing_for the next few months . That changes on December 15th 2025 . 6k on December 15th . The auditor for Rich Sparkle Wei Wei Co resigned as Sparkles auditor effective immediately . wouldnt be too much of a problem for a company of their stature if it werent for the fact that the company has filed notice that their 20F is going to come late . The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn who only has one follower despite being an American company and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with zero followers and filler posts that are just stock images Im not_one to want to cyberbully a small business but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company as of 2126 that just did a $ 975m acquisition ... yeah thats a bit sketchy . The biggest IPO Sparkles underwriter got involved in ... was historic for all the wrong reasons . I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece Im working on . This section is where Ill clear that up . The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares . Per prospectus Eddid Securities . Their website says that they help bring small to mediumsize companies to the market stuff the big investment banks dont have the time for . Small to mediumsize companies with the exception of one . Aint that a lovely throwback To any WSBers that were here during 2022 Im sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you . Their subsidiary Digital randomly skyrocketed 30000 % within the span of mere weeks in JulyAugust 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world . The only problem is that no_one exactly knew how this was even possible and no_it wasnt a meme stock as the media often claimed . AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kongrelated stocks Regencell Addentax etc that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $ 400b at its peak only to dump 90 % right after . The guy behind the IPO Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO and a year and a half before was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of Chinas biggest investment firms CMIG . This feud was so public CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a fraudster they shouldnt invest with . one of us if Im being real 😶‍🌫️ While AMTDs stock surge still hasnt been publicly explained yet its pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider coordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola Facebook and Walmart no Im not_joking within the span of weeks . The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process Looking at the underwriting records where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process prospectus Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022 Of course this isnt definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with while also considering that $ ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider coordination . AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC Hong Kongs version of the SEC . They recently got fined for failing to produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market . Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to have lost records and books relating to the listing of multimillion dollar companies Conclusion . Im not_here to make any definitive claims but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is and that the media is not_reporting on any of it at all . With the clear influencer angle and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has I feel like its hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that dont really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally cooked . Anyways hope you enjoyed this writeup . Im out ."

I'd like to start moving some funds out of equities into something more stable to avoid SORR when I start to draw down my IRA.

      "selftext": "The extraordinary price action in metals on Friday was plastered with comments from ex JPM global head Marko Kolanovic warning of massive correction in Silver prices due this year. Interestingly his latest post on X intraday Jan 30 when the price action was unfolding was about SLV rebounding. Peter Schiff sounded similar note at close of trading on Friday. The price action esp for Silver was truly extraordinary. One for the record books however I don’t think the doom and gloom end of the world posts all over the web actually capture the underlying structural shifts that have been in play in the precious metals market over the last year. 1 - physical demand story for Silver is still intact. The AI buildout, industrial demand for solar, electronics is still there. The biggest global silver miner Fresnillo has actually cut its 2026 production guidance. Even on friday the physical silver premium in shanghai was over $20. 2026 like its predecessor years will be marred by shortfall in silver supply unable to match the demand forecasts. 2 - another major trigger for Friday’s price action was obviously announcement of Kevin Warsh as fed pick. Markets have immediately perceived him as an interest rate hawk on balance based on his previous positioning. I think we are underestimating trump’s push for lower interest rates and the extent he went to pressure powell in aligning to his agendas. Its unthinkable that Trump wouldn’t have covered base with Kevin Warsh on what is expected of the next fed chair. 3 - yet another technical trigger for Friday’s price action was change in margin rules by CME on silver and gold contracts. I think this was the primary reason more than any other for the violent unwinding of the leverage trade in precious metals. Precious metals may not reclaim the ATHs anytime soon but I don’t think the story is over. I think the debasement trade, multi polar world order leading to uncertain geopolitical setup( potential iran attack, trumps impulsive trade wars) are still in play and will be for quite some time which in turn will keep SLV and GLD up and center.",

Some of you remember my Intel position - I had worked my way back from being down 95% into 39k, netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings.

Here we are, and I'm still in disbelief when I check the account total. I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude. I'm now trading nat gas (probably too big of a position), but no aggressive trades and definitely no more 0 DTE I just want to say: if you're down big atm, there's still a chance. It isn't going to be easy (I've spent every day/night hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets) but there's a chance you can come back. None of this is worth the stress though. That post-nut clarity once you've made it back is pretty sick though. \\[the large P/L for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $4900 on Friday - as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x...believe it or not those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $4700.\\]",

      "selftext": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates. Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2% at 2% inflation, President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1%, presumably around the middle of 2026 (I will explain why soon). Economics tells us, however, that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively, you need the stock market to drop, and quite hard. This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs, it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly, providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone, causing inflation to jump very quickly - potentially out of control. Of course, if you're cutting rates from the rather high 4.5% to the still high 3.75%, it isn't going to cause these issues, especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now, but the extreme 1% will not work the same. These factors, and more evidence which I will present here, leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop. Because isn't it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st (and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies), Trump announced the new Fed Chair, and the Epstein files were released (and some Iran news). Even more interesting, according to Business Insider, the Dow, on average, drops 15% after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair. February 1st was also the exact day that Trump would've pushed 10% tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise - and guess what? The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1. I don't believe it's a coincidence, but even if you do, we've had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 - hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic. Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he would've raised the tariffs by another 15%, ultimately leading me to believe June and July - after perhaps a 15-20% drop which would not surprise me - will be the bottom of this incoming bear market, and the time where rates will be cut to 1%. So, what do you think of this? Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not make it overly political. Thanks! Oh, and be careful bulls!",

      "selftext_processed": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates . Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2 % at 2 % inflation President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1 % presumably around the middle of 2026 I will explain why soon . Economics tells us however that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively you need the stock market to drop and quite hard . This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone causing inflation to jump very quickly potentially out of control . Of course if youre cutting rates from the rather high 4.5 % to the still high 3.75 % it isnt going to cause these issues especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now but the extreme 1 % will not_work the same . These factors and more evidence which I will present here leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop . Because isnt it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies Trump announced the new Fed Chair and the Epstein files were released and some Iran news . Even more interesting according to Business Insider the Dow on average drops 15 % after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair . February 1st was also the exact day that Trump wouldve pushed 10 % tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise and guess what The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1 . I dont believe its a coincidence but even if you do weve had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic . Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he wouldve raised the tariffs by another 15 % ultimately leading me to believe June and July after perhaps a 1520 % drop which would not_surprise me will be the bottom of this incoming bear market and the time where rates will be cut to 1 % . So what do you think of this Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not_make it overly political . Thanks Oh and be careful bulls"

Here’s my question however, I’m not super knowledgeable about the stock market but I’ve always been curious about investing my money myself and crypto has also spiked my interest a few times, I have a broker who invests the 300 dollars a month for me, he’s a family friend so I know him personally and he’s been doing this for a very long time. I’ve thought about opening my own Wealth Simple tfsa so I can put some money into that every month and invest myself into stock and etf, etc myself. Is it better to just keep letting my broker do it himself or should I contribute 200 or so a month into my Wealth Simple so I can invest myself. I know that was a bit to read and getting to the question took a bit but I wanted to not leave out any info lol. Thanks everyone !",

This is not an area of expertise for me so my best guess is that the corporation the stocks represent are \"forced\" to buy them back? Because if you're selling off stocks you're getting paid for their value. So where is that value coming from? Thanks in advanced for constructive on-topic replies.",

Who buys these freefalling stocks for more money than theyre going to be worth one minute later Who buys those freefalling stocks The obvious part is that no_one in their right mind would buy a stock high knowing that itll lose them money . This is not_an area of expertise for me so my best guess is that the corporation the stocks represent are forced to buy them back Because if youre selling off stocks youre getting paid for their value .

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a Nu holder and wanted to share an experience from a close friend in Brazil who recently decided to use Nu’s app to buy stocks instead of a traditional broker. Honestly, the experience sounds pretty rough. Some of the main issues he ran into: - You can only buy full shares (no fractional shares at all); - He placed a sell order during market hours, but the cash from the sale didn’t show up immediately in his account; - No live stock prices, you can’t really track price movements in real time; - Very limited information on the stocks (no depth, no proper charts, no context); - App navigation is Portuguese-only, no language flexibility; - The app feels cluttered with ads pushing credit products and services; - Buying and selling stocks doesn’t feel smooth or intuitive at all. This made me wonder: Is Nu treating stock investing as a serious long-term product, or just a secondary feature to cross-sell credit and banking services? As investors, we often focus on: user growth, engagement, ecosystem expansion. But product quality matters, especially if Nu wants to keep users inside its platform instead of losing them to real brokers. For those in Brazil actually using Nu Invest: Has this been your experience too? Has it improved recently? Do you still use it, or did you move to another platform? Curious to hear real user feedback, especially from locals.",

      "selftext": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago. I was/am very ignorant of investing. One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees. I looked through my statements and saw around $300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025. That's around $1200 a year in fees! I checked 2021-2024 and it was only a $40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief. I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year. I don't think the advisor did anything shady. They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didn't ask enough questions about it. My friend also made me aware of all the \"invisible\" fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades. So now I'm looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees. I'm considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3% match for IRA transfers and contributions, or Fidelity since that's what my 401k is in and it'd be nice to have it all in once place. I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH, not withdraw what I already have. Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages? I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake. Next. Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself, I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in. I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had high(er) expense ratios. My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped. I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds. The split would be 80% stock(US and Foreign) and 20% bonds. Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that I've done. I'm not looking to do anything fancy or game the market. I'm just going to max my contribution each year, then sit and hold for 30 years. Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above? Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA, then selling everything my advisor had me in, then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup. I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first. I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications? Any help is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago . I wasam very ignorant of investing . One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees . I looked through my statements and saw around $ 300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025 . Thats around $ 1200 a year in fees I checked 20212024 and it was only a $ 40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief . I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year . I dont think the advisor did anything shady . They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didnt ask enough questions about it . My friend also made me aware of all the invisible fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades . So now Im looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees . Im considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3 % match for IRA transfers and contributions or Fidelity since thats what my 401k is in and itd be nice to have it all in once place . I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH not_withdraw what I already have . Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake . Next . Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in . I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had higher expense ratios . My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped . I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds . The split would be 80 % stockUS and Foreign and 20 % bonds . Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that Ive done . Im not_looking to do anything fancy or game the market . Im just going to max my contribution each year then sit and hold for 30 years . Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA then selling everything my advisor had me in then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup . I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first . I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications Any help is appreciated ."

But their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is quietly growing and giving Coke another unique competitive advantage. These freestyle machines can give consumers multiple choices of drinks and the ability to mix multiple drinks. But not everyone realises this has made Coca-Cola hundreds of millions or more. This machine helps Coca-Cola know what favours people are using the most which means they know what drinks work and they can promote it. Saving on marketing costs as they know what to focus on. Also with people mixing drinks it can give Coca-Cola ideas for new drinks which can also help grow the business But what’s your thoughts? Thanks for reading",

But their CocaCola Freestyle machine is quietly growing and giving Coke another unique competitive advantage . These freestyle machines can give consumers multiple choices of drinks and the ability to mix multiple drinks . But not_everyone realises this has made CocaCola hundreds of millions or more . This machine helps CocaCola know what favours people are using the most which means they know what drinks work and they can promote it . Saving on marketing costs as they know what to focus on . Also with people mixing drinks it can give CocaCola ideas for new drinks which can also help grow the business But what ’ s your thoughts Thanks for reading"

Lately, I’ve been thinking about switching to Trading 212, but I’m a bit stuck on how (or if) I should do it. Right now, I have the Revolut Metal subscription, which gives me 10 free trades per month, and I’ve already paid for the full year. From what I see, I basically have two options: Option 1: Just stay with Revolut and keep investing there, since I’m already paying for Metal anyway. Option 2: Slowly move out: • Each month, sell a position using my free trades • Reinvest that money into Trading 212 • Stop adding new money to Revolut and only fund 212 going forward Transferring everything at once isn’t really an option, because Revolut charges €35 per stock for transfers. Give me your advice. If you want to advise another broker feel free, I live at Europe if that helps.",

      "selftext": "MSTR currently has about 712k coins and their net debt is about $14B (according to their website). For MSTR to cover their debt, coin price needs to be >$20k. But they couldn't wait for that price to start selling because this would trigger a crash and they wouldn't get an average price of $20k. So at what price do you think MSTR would have to start selling? UPDATE 5 Feb 2026: I would like to thank all of you who have contributed to this discussion. Great insights and very interesting. As I write, Bitcoin has dropped below $66k and MSTR below $110. There is no agreement here on what price of Bitcoin would force MSTR to start selling theirs. This is because it is believed that MSTR's loans are not dependent on the Bitcoin price. But it's ability to roll-over those loans in the years to come and its ability to raise money through diluting common stock holders, are very dependent on coin price. Based on all the comments, my instinct is that below $50k/coin MSTR will be in damage control mode and below $20k/coin in desperate trouble from investors and lenders, even if not legally forced to sell Bitcoins immediately.",

      "selftext_processed": "MSTR currently has about 712k coins and their net debt is about $ 14B according to their website . For MSTR to cover their debt coin price needs to be $ 20k . But they couldnt wait for that price to start selling because this would trigger a crash and they wouldnt get an average price of $ 20k . So at what price do you think MSTR would have to start selling UPDATE 5 Feb 2026 I would like to thank all of you who have contributed to this discussion . Great insights and very interesting . As I write Bitcoin has dropped below $ 66k and MSTR below $ 110 . There is no_agreement here on what price of Bitcoin would force MSTR to start selling theirs . This is because it is believed that MSTRs loans are not_dependent on the Bitcoin price . But its ability to rollover those loans in the years to come and its ability to raise money through diluting common stock holders are very dependent on coin price . Based on all the comments my instinct is that below $ 50kcoin MSTR will be in damage control mode and below $ 20kcoin in desperate trouble from investors and lenders even if not_legally forced to sell Bitcoins immediately ."

      "title": "How to filter Insider Trading data: Why buying high is actually a stronger signal than buying low",
      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer analysis, so I will try to explain my strategy at once** Okay, so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals, better data, and direct lines to management. Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However, there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours: SEC Form 4 Filings. I’ve spent the last few months (during my masters degree) refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity. I’m not talking about following politicians. I’m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it’s public. Below is the framework I use to filter this data, backed by academic research that explains *why* this works. # The Signal: The \"Cluster Buy\" A single insider buying stock can mean anything. They might be saving face, diversifying, or just optimistic. It’s noisy data. The real signal is the **Cluster Buy**. This occurs when **three or more unique insiders** purchase stock on the open market within a short window (usually <30 days). * **Why it matters:** Research by Alldredge and Blank (2019) confirms that insiders \"herd\" with their colleagues. They found an insider is nearly **four times more likely** to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently * **The Hierarchy:** Not all clusters are equal. Clusters led by **CFOs and Directors** exhibit the highest subsequent returns. The CFO knows the numbers; Directors see the strategy. When they move together, it’s a high-conviction signal. # The Filter: Ignoring the Noise 90% of insider transactions are noise. To find the alpha, you have to filter aggressively. Here are the three specific filters I use: **1. Ignore \"Routine\" Trades** We are looking for **Opportunistic Traders**. If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons, that trade contains zero information. You want to see trades that break a pattern. **2. The \"Buy High\" Anomaly** Conventional wisdom says \"buy low.\" However, research by Li, Wang, Yan, and Zhang (2019) uncovered a powerful anomaly: **Insiders who buy at 52-week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52-week lows**. * **The Logic:** This is called overcoming \"Anchoring Bias.\" Psychologically, it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30%. If an insider buys at a 52-week high, they are fighting human nature. They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher. A \"High Buy\" is a massive confidence signal. **3. The \"Not-Sold\" Signal** Sometimes the best signal is what insiders *don't* do. DeVault, Cederburg, and Wang (2021) analyzed **Portfolio Insiders** (directors who sit on multiple boards). * **The Signal:** If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B, and they sell Company A but **hold** Company B, the \"Not-Sold\" stock (Company B) significantly outperforms the market. If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock, check if those insiders are selling their *other* holdings to fund it. That doubles the conviction. # The Execution: Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one. Execution is where you make or lose money. **Rule 1: Wait for Price Confirmation** Insiders are notoriously early. They are value investors with infinite time horizons. You are not. * **My Trigger:** I wait for the stock to **reclaim the average price** of the insider's purchase. * **The Logic:** If the CFO buys at $50 and the stock drops to $40, the market disagrees with him. I stay away. When the stock rallies back through $50, it confirms the \"Insider Floor\" is holding and momentum is aligning with the insider's view. **Rule 2: Focus on Liquid Stocks** Paradoxically, insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks. Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume. A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks. **Rule 3: The \"Silent\" Exit** Retail investors usually sell too early or too late. I watch the insiders. If they stop buying during a subsequent dip, or if they start \"Routine\" selling into strength, the edge is gone. # Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash (especially at 52-week highs) it is the purest signal of value you can find. I track these **Cluster Buys** and publish a deep-dive watchlist of the most significant ones every week.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer analysis so I will try to explain my strategy at once Okay so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals better data and direct lines to management . Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours SEC Form 4 Filings . I ’ ve spent the last few months during my masters degree refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity . I ’ m not_talking about following politicians . I ’ m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it ’ s public . Below is the framework I use to filter this data backed by academic research that explains why this works . The Signal The Cluster Buy A single insider buying stock can mean anything . They might be saving face diversifying or just optimistic . It ’ s noisy data . The real signal is the Cluster Buy . This occurs when three or more unique insiders purchase stock on the open market within a short window usually 30 days . Why it matters Research by Alldredge and Blank 2019 confirms that insiders herd with their colleagues . They found an insider is nearly four times more likely to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently The Hierarchy Not_all clusters are equal . Clusters led by CFOs and Directors exhibit the highest subsequent returns . The CFO knows the numbers Directors see the strategy . When they move together it ’ s a highconviction signal . The Filter Ignoring the Noise 90 % of insider transactions are noise . To find the alpha you have to filter aggressively . Here are the three specific filters I use 1 . Ignore Routine Trades We are looking for Opportunistic Traders . If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons that trade contains zero information . You want to see trades that break a pattern . 2 . The Buy High Anomaly Conventional wisdom says buy low . However research by Li Wang Yan and Zhang 2019 uncovered a powerful anomaly Insiders who buy at 52week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52week lows . The Logic This is called overcoming Anchoring Bias . Psychologically it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30 % . If an insider buys at a 52week high they are fighting human nature . They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher . A High Buy is a massive confidence signal . 3 . The NotSold Signal Sometimes the best signal is what insiders dont do . DeVault Cederburg and Wang 2021 analyzed Portfolio Insiders directors who sit on multiple boards . The Signal If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B and they sell Company A but hold Company B the NotSold stock Company B significantly outperforms the market . If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock check if those insiders are selling their other holdings to fund it . That doubles the conviction . The Execution Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one . Execution is where you make or lose money . Rule 1 Wait for Price Confirmation Insiders are notoriously early . They are value investors with infinite time horizons . You are not_ My Trigger I wait for the stock to reclaim the average price of the insiders purchase . The Logic If the CFO buys at $ 50 and the stock drops to $ 40 the market disagrees with him . I stay away . When the stock rallies back through $ 50 it confirms the Insider Floor is holding and momentum is aligning with the insiders view . Rule 2 Focus on Liquid Stocks Paradoxically insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks . Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume . A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks . Rule 3 The Silent Exit Retail investors usually sell too early or too late . I watch the insiders . If they stop buying during a subsequent dip or if they start Routine selling into strength the edge is gone . Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash especially at 52week highs it is the purest signal of value you can find . I track these Cluster Buys and publish a deepdive watchlist of the most significant ones every week ."

      "title": "GlobalFoundries $GFS has 101.25% Institutional Ownerships with 11.66% of the float short.",
      "selftext": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th, the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips, for $20B, that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them, which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $GFS, who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics, the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq. What left me dumbfounded, is why $GFS was trading flat on the news for the week, and looking deeper into the stock, I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th, a week before Nvidia buying Groq, there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares, that barely moved the stock at all on that date, wtf… I know Quad-witching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that don't necessarily affect the stock, but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock’s volume on Quad-witching… So, putting two and two together, someone *probably* knew Nvidia was buying Groq, and they used the Quad-Witching date to load the f’king boat on GlobalFoundries. A week after the Groq acquisition, $GFS finally started climbing rapidly, from $35, to over $48 on January 27th, before pulling back to its current price of $42.20. Why the curious delayed reaction to the move? I believe, because this stock is shorted to the gills, and *someone* can’t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out. One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $GFS is currently shorted, Institutions hold 101.25% of the float, while a whopping 11.66% of that float is short, which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi’s… For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month. One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M! Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post. Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself. That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS. To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \\[OBV\\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month! $GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger……….. As always, this is not Financial Advice, don't blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet, this is all PURE speculation on my part. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** From u/Independent-Exam1863 comment below, the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with it's GR00Ts Robotics program. It all starts to make sense with $GFS acquisition of MIPS & Synopsis, who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI; with their acquisition $GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE 2\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** Well, holy shit, I should've dug deeper into this, Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis!",

      "selftext_processed": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips for $ 20B that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $ GFS who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq . What left me dumbfounded is why $ GFS was trading flat on the news for the week and looking deeper into the stock I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th a week before Nvidia buying Groq there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares that barely moved the stock at all on that date wtf… I know Quadwitching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that dont necessarily affect the stock but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock ’ s volume on Quadwitching… So putting two and two together someone probably knew Nvidia was buying Groq and they used the QuadWitching date to load the f ’ king boat on GlobalFoundries . A week after the Groq acquisition $ GFS finally started climbing rapidly from $ 35 to over $ 48 on January 27th before pulling back to its current price of $ 42.20 . Why the curious delayed reaction to the move I believe because this stock is shorted to the gills and someone can ’ t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out . One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $ GFS is currently shorted Institutions hold 101.25 % of the float while a whopping 11.66 % of that float is short which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi ’ s… For more confirmation that $ GFS is dangerously shorted on Dec 31st just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $ 35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere_downgrading the stock and dropping the stock nearly 4 % on the day instead of continuing its plunge Bulls smelled blood in the water and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $ 48 in less than a month . One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 41726 $ 45 Calls for $ 5.2M then sold it for $ 14.2M on the price surge and then doubled down with 417 $ 55 Calls for nearly $ 10M Clearly they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 211 and that brings me to my first point of this post . Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI so they spent $ 20B on Groq AI Chips and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips if you ’ re Nvidia you ’ re not_gonna spend $ 20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips so the next logical investment for $ NVDA is to buy a stake in $ GFS itself . That MUST be what that Options Whale is betting on maybe an announcement on 211 earnings and with $ GFS so heavily shorted this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $ NVDA does intend to invest in $ GFS . To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries below is the Daily OnBalance Volume OBV chart ignore all those black lines in the middle those are my Intraday trendlines the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure to nearly hitting its Dec ’ 22 ATHs before pulling back but still staying above the Gann Fan and breaking that downward trend in just a single month $ GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options I believe Longs are betting on a run soon with or without $ NVDA buying a stake in $ GFS AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in . My position is 9 July 17th $ 45 Calls wish my account were bigger……… .. As always this is not_Financial Advice dont blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet this is all PURE speculation on my part . UPDATE From uIndependentExam1863 comment below the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with its GR00Ts Robotics program . It all starts to make sense with $ GFS acquisition of MIPS Synopsis who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI with their acquisition $ GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips . UPDATE 2 Well holy shit I shouldve dug deeper into this Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis"

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, staying fully invested is often treated as the default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over long horizons, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally maintain a degree of flexibility through modest allocations to cash or short-duration assets. This can allow rebalancing, deployment during drawdowns, or reduced forced selling during periods of market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it may also affect risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is structured and used. From a portfolio construction standpoint, how do you think about this tradeoff? Do you view flexibility as a form of risk management, or as an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? How do you approach this in practice over full market cycles.?",
