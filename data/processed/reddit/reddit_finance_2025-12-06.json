At its core, return stacking is the idea of layering one investment return on top of another to achieve more than $1.00 of exposure for every $1.00 invested. This is typically done to maintain core portfolio exposure (like stocks and bonds) while simultaneously introducing new, diversifying return streams (like managed futures or other alternative strategies).",

My strategy is basically options trading and determining the support and resistance levels for tickers. Robinhood has been the ticker I’ve been going in and out of since I started this strategy back in September. Anyways on DEC 3rd I bought a few contracts of HOOD 137 call EXP 12/12. Robinhood has been very reactive on rate cut probabilities. With the PCE data coming out today and high probability that the number would come in lower than expected I thought it would be a safe call to hold until Friday and see if the stock climbs higher. It did the opposite of that and before any data was even released. As it dipped this morning my decision was to hold until after the release of the PCE. My assumption was that the Market was reacting out of fear not data. It climbed a little after the PCE was released but eventually settled to 131.80. I was right about the data but was wrong about the Markets reaction.",

      "selftext": "I've followed investanswers channel quiet some time even though I knew he's a Tesla shill. I subscribed to his patreon for some time and here are my findings. He got in early on Tesla, microstrategy etc. And he covers a daily segment on Tesla and how pristine the investment is. Pushes out these wild targets where he calls for a 20 Trillion market cap for Tesla as a company alone in the next 5-10 yrs. Up until recently, he spread misinformation on Google's Gemini efforts, belittled them as a clumsily run big company that doesn't innovate anymore. And kept pushing this idea that grok is the gold standard in LLMs. Now that Google has rerated significantly and Elon kinda praising Google, he flipped the switch and started positively about Google and even stating that he's kinda \"mad\" that he missed on the Google rerating. He consistently dunks on Rivian when that company is genuinely seeing a new chapter now and spread misinformation. He consistently dunks on Uber because Tesla needs to drain some market share in ride hailing and calls them a great short idea. Meanwhile Uber currently generates more free cash flow than Tesla. He kept talking in his videos on multiple occasions how Warren buffet could \"cement his legacy\" if he put a tiny bit of his wealth in Tesla. Every earnings call he'd group with his fellow early Tesla investor cult and contributes to keeping the stock afloat. This guy has strong tradfi background. And is very good at trading and sounds wise like a veteran investor. But underneath it is all festering greed to manipulate new investors. He uses data that is convenient and shallow sometimes to make a \"great case\" for Tesla stock. He's very deft at coaxing the uninitiated by using his legitimate tradfi experience. Be very careful if you consume his content, this guy knows how to use real information and tweak the narrative in an extremely favorable manner towards the assets he holds. Yes, we see a lot of shills on YouTube and X. But this guy is truly pernicious. Be careful young investors. Cheers!",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive followed investanswers channel quiet some time even though I knew hes a Tesla shill . I subscribed to his patreon for some time and here are my findings . He got in early on Tesla microstrategy etc . And he covers a daily segment on Tesla and how pristine the investment is . Pushes out these wild targets where he calls for a 20 Trillion market cap for Tesla as a company alone in the next 510 yrs . Up until recently he spread misinformation on Googles Gemini efforts belittled them as a clumsily run big company that doesnt innovate anymore . And kept pushing this idea that grok is the gold standard in LLMs . Now that Google has rerated significantly and Elon kinda praising Google he flipped the switch and started positively about Google and even stating that hes kinda mad that he missed on the Google rerating . He consistently dunks on Rivian when that company is genuinely seeing a new chapter now and spread misinformation . He consistently dunks on Uber because Tesla needs to drain some market share in ride hailing and calls them a great short idea . Meanwhile Uber currently generates more free cash flow than Tesla . He kept talking in his videos on multiple occasions how Warren buffet could cement his legacy if he put a tiny bit of his wealth in Tesla . Every earnings call hed group with his fellow early Tesla investor cult and contributes to keeping the stock afloat . This guy has strong tradfi background . And is very good at trading and sounds wise like a veteran investor . But underneath it is all festering greed to manipulate new investors . He uses data that is convenient and shallow sometimes to make a great case for Tesla stock . Hes very deft at coaxing the uninitiated by using his legitimate tradfi experience . Be very careful if you consume his content this guy knows how to use real information and tweak the narrative in an extremely favorable manner towards the assets he holds . Yes we see a lot of shills on YouTube and X . But this guy is truly pernicious . Be careful young investors . Cheers"

      "selftext": "I used to think trading fees were just part of trading,like you pay them and move on. But lately I’ve been noticing how much they mess with my decisions. I lookout for larger profit margin before each trade A few days ago I tried a small experiment on Bitget 0 fee stock race. I did some trades using tokenized stocks (E.G. NVDA/AMZN tokenized stocks). I wasn’t doing it because I think it’s the future or anything. I just wanted to see how it is. And honestly it felt different in a way I didn’t expect. When there’s a cost on every move, I do this thing where I start negotiating with myself. I hesitate on entries, then I end up late. Or I hold a loser longer because I’m thinking “I already paid to get in” which is dumb but my brain does it anyway. Sometimes I even size bigger than I should, not because the setup is better, but because it feels like I have to “make it worth it.” With this test, I noticed my behavior calmed down. First, I stopped doing that internal debate. It was just, do I like the setup or not. Second, my sizing got more normal. I could scale in or cut without feeling like every adjustment was a tax. I didn’t feel forced into making fewer, bigger decisions. Third, I chased less. I thought removing friction would make me click more, but it was kind of the opposite. Because I could act anytime, I didn’t feel pressure to act right now. I’m not saying this makes anyone profitable or that fees are the root of all evil. But I do think “cost to act” is a real factor in trading psychology, and most people don’t track it. They track their entries and exits, but not the way friction pushes them into weird choices. Anyway I’m going to keep running this for the Phase 3 window as a personal test and see what it does to my stats. If the only thing that changed is friction and my results improve, that’s going to be a little uncomfortable to admit. Curious if anyone else noticed this when switching to lower fee setups, even just going from one broker to another. Did you end up trading more, or did you just trade smarter?",

      "selftext_processed": "I used to think trading fees were just part of tradinglike you pay them and move on . But lately I ’ ve been noticing how much they mess with my decisions . I lookout for larger profit margin before each trade A few days ago I tried a small experiment on Bitget 0 fee stock race . I did some trades using tokenized stocks E.G . NVDAAMZN tokenized stocks . I wasn ’ t doing it because I think it ’ s the future or anything . I just wanted to see how it is . And honestly it felt different in a way I didn ’ t expect . When there ’ s a cost on every move I do this thing where I start negotiating with myself . I hesitate on entries then I end up late . Or I hold a loser longer because I ’ m thinking “ I already paid to get in ” which is dumb but my brain does it anyway . Sometimes I even size bigger than I should not_because the setup is better but because it feels like I have to “ make it worth it. ” With this test I noticed my behavior calmed down . First I stopped doing that internal debate . It was just do I like the setup or not_Second my sizing got more normal . I could scale in or cut without feeling like every adjustment was a tax . I didn ’ t feel forced into making fewer bigger decisions . Third I chased less . I thought removing friction would make me click more but it was kind of the opposite . Because I could act anytime I didn ’ t feel pressure to act right now . I ’ m not_saying this makes anyone profitable or that fees are the root of all evil . But I do think “ cost to act ” is a real factor in trading psychology and most people don ’ t track it . They track their entries and exits but not_the way friction pushes them into weird choices . Anyway I ’ m going to keep running this for the Phase 3 window as a personal test and see what it does to my stats . If the only thing that changed is friction and my results improve that ’ s going to be a little uncomfortable to admit . Curious if anyone else noticed this when switching to lower fee setups even just going from one broker to another . Did you end up trading more or did you just trade smarter"

      "selftext": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never touch it, even more specifically the S&P 500 as it has outperformed 90% of all individual stocks in about 85% of all hedge funds and 75% of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor. This is why the S&P 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes, period. While all of this may be true, there is something that still needs to be considered: When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007, it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing is wrong and just keep passively investing. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive, however, there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous. The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max, the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50% or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50% decline, The US dollar will devalue dramatically. In this current predicament, I would not say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging. If you were to buy in 2007 or pre- Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25-year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the S&P 500. And for the Great depression, it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even. So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 20-40 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years. This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on. According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader, it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not 9 months, but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds, not US bonds for reasons I can discuss later, as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession. So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions. After a substantial decline my goal is buy at -20%, then -35% then near -50% is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession. Please do not be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term. PS. My average annualized percent gain is 50%. Try getting that in an index fund",

This is why the SP 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes period . While all of this may be true there is something that still needs to be considered When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007 it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing_is wrong and just keep passively investing . The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent . That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive however there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous . The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50 % or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50 % decline The US dollar will devalue dramatically . In this current predicament I would not_say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging . If you were to buy in 2007 or pre Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the SP 500 . And for the Great depression it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even . So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 2040 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years . This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on . According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not_9 months but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds not_US bonds for reasons I can discuss later as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession . So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions . After a substantial decline my goal is buy at 20 % then 35 % then near 50 % is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession . Please do not_be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term . PS . My average annualized percent gain is 50 % . Try getting that in an index fund"

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware? Note: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation. Please feel free to correct me!",

The other 2 RAM companies Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 13rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely . The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can ’ t meet expectations thus not_making profits causing the bubble to pop or the market crash . But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware . If the crash occurs how would their stocks drop if they are making profits by selling hardware Note I ’ m a fairly new investor so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation .

Their current valuation isn't that far off from the bid on Beacon to begin with and as far as I can tell the CEO, Brad Jacobs, seems to have a great track record. I am from Sweden so I don't know that much about the construction sector in the US, but with coming (probable) decision on rate cuts and hopefully a growing economy - I can't really understand why this stock seems to be flying under the radar? It's not a small company by any means - and wouldn't benefit any less then companies like OPEN that got so much attention earlier. So is there some big thing that I am missing? In terms of risk/reward it seems like a safe play and the upside could be huge if the 50B revenue can actually be achieved in the future. URI and XPO has blown up before. I got 335 shares on a cost basis of around 18,7 - but am I stupid for thinking that this will probably be worth a couple of times more within the coming years?",

Their current valuation isnt that far off from the bid on Beacon to begin with and as far as I can tell the CEO Brad Jacobs seems to have a great track record . I am from Sweden so I dont know that much about the construction sector in the US but with coming probable decision on rate cuts and hopefully a growing economy I cant really understand why this stock seems to be flying under the radar Its not_a small company by any means and wouldnt benefit any less then companies like OPEN that got so much attention earlier . So is there some big thing that I am missing In terms of riskreward it seems like a safe play and the upside could be huge if the 50B revenue can actually be achieved in the future . URI and XPO has blown up before . I got 335 shares on a cost basis of around 187 but am I stupid for thinking that this will probably be worth a couple of times more within the coming years"

The deal adds a world class brand to its rapidly expanding Beyond Beer portfolio, which already includes Cutwater Spirits, NÜTRL Vodka Sparkling, and Phorm Energy. As one of the top ten RTD brands in the industry, BeatBox is said to complement A-B's Beyond Beer offerings while introducing progressive flavors and styles to the company's existing RTD portfolio. The BeatBox deal further underscores the need for major brewers to acquire more emerging non beer brands to counteract the beer industry's growing structural headwinds.",

As one of the top ten RTD brands in the industry BeatBox is said to complement ABs Beyond Beer offerings while introducing progressive flavors and styles to the companys existing RTD portfolio . The BeatBox deal further underscores the need for major brewers to acquire more emerging non beer brands to counteract the beer industrys growing structural headwinds ."

      "selftext": "Man, I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that we’re like twenty something days away from 2026. This year just flew by and honestly, it was kinda wild in a good way. Hands down, my favorite move of the year was piling into NVDA back in March/April when the market vibe was super doom and gloom. Everyone was like, “chips are way too high, risky as hell,” and I was sitting there thinking, “Nah dude this is the moment,” so I slammed that buy button hard. And… you saw how that played out. AI popped off everywhere, and NVDA just took off like a freakin’ rocket Low key, the gains scared me for a minute. Probably the closest I’ve ever gotten to “holy shit profit” on a long-term play seriously. Of course balance in the universe I dumped LLY way too early. Thought it was overextended, figured a pullback was coming and then the damn thing just kept moon-walking upward. Every time I see news about it: “So I basically sold a money printer cool cool cool Anyway, I’m already cooking up my 2026 plans. Right now I’m thinking: • Still adding to tech, but way more picky this time • Pumping up my healthcare dividend positions • Maybe dipping into some international ETFs if the setup looks good Still brainstorming, but that’s the rough game plan. So tell me ： What was YOUR craziest win of 2025? Any trade that still haunts you like “bro if I could just redo that one move And for 2026 full send again? Or just stacking cash and staying chill? Drop your war stories I need some inspiration too, man!",

The earnings revision rating for the past three months is currently A with 19 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions . Revenue data shows 18 upward revisions and 0 downward revisions indicating bullish sentiment behind the stock . So is it still worth adding to or buying at the current price"

      "title": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve",
      "selftext": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)]( \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI. # Full-stack AI Now, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve). But what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product. But before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering? I’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis]( worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future. # AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms]( The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on. Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that. # All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”]( Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly. Nvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD. **Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. **TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.",

      "selftext_processed": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company ’ s conception . Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000 Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google . So we had the ultimate search engine it would understand everything on the web it would understand um you know exactly what you wanted and it would give you the right thing . And thats obviously artificial intelligence . Google CoFounder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI 2000 For those that don ’ t know it was supposedly Larry Page ’ s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI . Fullstack AI Now imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation . Your first thought will probably be Which should I pick ChatGPT immediately comes to mind but you want to do your research properly . Through your research you find that Googles Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck at least among American AI models . Plus they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model . Perfect . Google seems like a good choice . Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity especially if they improve . But what about implementation Google offers enterpriseready APIs via Vertex with more features coming like auth database and payments Google Cloud for storage and now even at location TPUs that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible . Super . Suddenly your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google and along the way you never_touch an Nvidia product . But before you make your final decision you ask yourself Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term so I don ’ t get vendorlocked with an inferior offering I ’ ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never_want to bet against the man and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way . I don ’ t imagine Nvidia is particularly or really at all threatened by Google in the short term though Googles TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices reducing profit margin . Apparently OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia . Though what is actually important is not_the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future . AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve A Geminipowered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms The evolutionary AI system had in secret improved everything from the training of their AI models to Googles hardware i.e . their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multibillion dollar deal for them with Meta considering the same . The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro not_even Gemini 2.5 . Today it ’ s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations and in the future it will use far more powerful models than that . Meaning that the better Google ’ s AI models get the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google ’ s models and hardware . The cheaper and better Google ’ s hardware the more powerful models can be built and run . The more powerful the models the better the hardware . And so on . Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia ’ s CUDA moat . One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA . But once AI models become sufficiently advanced the programming difficulty may not_be a concern or Google and Gemini create some CUDAvariant of their own . Rumors also exist of them doing just that . All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business it ’ s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia . If they do it often enough AI labs will eventually wonder can you build better AI models without Nvidia This will be especially true if other AIlabs do it too “ resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs ” Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for Not_at all as I said Ive spent enough time studying Jensen that Id never_want to bet against him . After all he is a man who roommated with a 17yearold excon covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5trilliondollar man . Jensen has a ton of cards to play and he ’ s already playing them perfectly . Nvidia still has a hardwarehardwaresoftware lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future . If they make a substantial compute leap Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia ’ s AI lab absorb one of the AI labs or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race . He is securing longterm deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia . Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development . He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem . Nvidia will likely begin to offer fullstack solutions of its own . And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia Google and AMD . Disclaimer I hold a significant long position in Google Alphabet . The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not_constitute financial or investment advice . Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions . TLDR Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin . But over the long term Google ’ s full stack offerings AI modelsapplications cloud and TPUs with AI model ’ s designed to improve AI models and hardware AlphaEvolve getting better Google might even take a long term lead . Though Jensen is playing Nvidia ’ s cards perfectly ."

      "selftext": "Today, Microsoft shareholders formally approved all company proposals, including board elections and the 2026 stock plan. But more notably shareholders rejected all six shareholder proposals, including one demanding Microsoft submit a “human rights due diligence report.” This raises several questions: Amid AI's sweeping expansion, Microsoft increasingly resembles a “state-owned enterprise among tech giants.” Yet shareholders have clearly granted the company greater autonomy this time. From a purely market perspective, this outcome is almost entirely positive for the stock price, as the company avoids being shackled by additional regulatory reporting requirements. Yet from a long-term ESG and social responsibility perspective, won't this become a latent concern for Microsoft? Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI, AI regulation, and data ethics. My personal take: This vote feels more like the market collectively saying, “Keep driving performance we don't want distractions.” But as AI operations expand, whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain. What are your thoughts? Is this a rational market choice, or is it merely deferring potential long-term risks? I'm particularly curious to hear others' perspectives on Microsoft's positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years.",

      "selftext": "Today, U.S. stocks staged a sharp rebound as inflation data eased and expectations for interest rate cuts intensified, with tech stocks leading the charge. It feels like a prime opportunity to bottom-fish or add positions in growth, tech, and semiconductor stocks. I'm currently monitoring META and NVDA: 1.META: Its advertising and social platform fundamentals remain solid. If new ventures like AI, cloud, and content recommendations continue to gain traction, falling interest rates could be quite favorable. 2.NVDA: Should interest rates ease while AI and data center demand persists, NVDA could see a surge in resilience. For those seeking exposure to the rebound without excessive risk, these companies offer relatively lower risk profiles while retaining upside potential. If you were to add positions today, would you choose growth, AI, or chip stocks? This is for discussion only. You are responsible for your own portfolio decisions never invest lightly.",

If new ventures like AI cloud and content recommendations continue to gain traction falling interest rates could be quite favorable . 2.NVDA Should interest rates ease while AI and data center demand persists NVDA could see a surge in resilience .

      "title": "“Buying on dips” isn't as effective as imagined; over the long term, it may even be less effective than “buy and hold.”",
      "selftext": "The reason lies in the fact that buying on dips essentially involves counter trend trading during periods of market momentum that is, anticipating reversals while the trend persists, thereby imposing value investing principles onto momentum cycles. Historical data indicates that trends tend to continue rather than reverse immediately. Furthermore, when examining the correlation between buying on dips and the SG Trend Index, it was discovered that the SG Trend Index represents the average return of the top 10 hedge funds employing trend following strategies. The correlation coefficient is -0.14, a modest value, yet it maintains a negative correlation across all strategies. In contrast, trend following delivers genuine value during market declines. Analyzing four bear market periods, the “buy the dip” strategy averaged an 18% decline, while the S&P 500 averaged a 40% drop. Conversely, the trend strategy gained 29%. More intriguingly, testing 196 “buy the dip” strategies against the S&P 500 revealed: Risk adjusted returns (technically called the Sharpe ratio) were worse than passive holding across all strategies. I believe the core issue is that there's no endless stream of capital waiting to buy the dip, so you must sell at some point. This exit timing must be precise: too early, and the gains from buying the dip are largely offset by missed upside; too late, and you might miss the rally entirely. Therefore, bottom fishing is fundamentally suited for those with idle cash. Without it, one must resort to margin trading or even borrowing money to leverage stock investments, which carries enormous risk. In summary, for bottom fishing to succeed, the timing of stock purchases must be more opportune than usual, and cash reserves must be sufficient. Another challenge lies in defining the rules for testing bottom fishing strategies, such as duration and extent of decline.",

      "selftext_processed": "The reason lies in the fact that buying on dips essentially involves counter trend trading during periods of market momentum that is anticipating reversals while the trend persists thereby imposing value investing principles onto momentum cycles . Historical data indicates that trends tend to continue rather than reverse immediately . Furthermore when examining the correlation between buying on dips and the SG Trend Index it was discovered that the SG Trend Index represents the average return of the top 10 hedge funds employing trend following strategies . The correlation coefficient is 0.14 a modest value yet it maintains a negative correlation across all strategies . In contrast trend following delivers genuine value during market declines . Analyzing four bear market periods the “ buy the dip ” strategy averaged an 18 % decline while the SP 500 averaged a 40 % drop . Conversely the trend strategy gained 29 % . More intriguingly testing 196 “ buy the dip ” strategies against the SP 500 revealed Risk adjusted returns technically called the Sharpe ratio were worse than passive holding across all strategies . I believe the core issue is that theres no_endless stream of capital waiting to buy the dip so you must sell at some point . This exit timing must be precise too early and the gains from buying the dip are largely offset by missed upside too late and you might miss the rally entirely . Therefore bottom fishing is fundamentally suited for those with idle cash . Without it one must resort to margin trading or even borrowing money to leverage stock investments which carries enormous risk . In summary for bottom fishing to succeed the timing of stock purchases must be more opportune than usual and cash reserves must be sufficient . Another challenge lies in defining the rules for testing bottom fishing strategies such as duration and extent of decline ."

      "selftext": "Today's data is a bit complex. The December Consumer Confidence Index edged up slightly to 53.3, which appears positive, but the increase actually falls within the margin of error. The real notable improvement lies in the expectations of younger demographics and personal financial outlooks, which rose by 13%. However, overall consumer sentiment remains cautious, with high inflation pressures frequently cited. Labor market expectations, though slightly better than in November, remain weak. What surprised me is: Short-term inflation expectations have fallen for four consecutive months, reaching 4.1% the lowest this year while long-term expectations also dropped to 3.2%. This part does offer the market some breathing room. But the issues are: The improvement in sentiment is modest. Consumer concerns about “personal finances over the next year” are even more pessimistic than at the start of the year. Labor market expectations continue to hover at low levels. This leaves me somewhat hesitant Does this combination of “mild recovery + persistent caution” truly count as positive news? My take is: Markets may interpret “declining inflation expectations” as a bullish signal, but consumer spending hasn't truly regained momentum. In this scenario, equities might adopt an “optimistic interpretation” in the short term, yet sustainability hinges on upcoming employment, wage, and inflation data in the coming weeks. What are your thoughts? Is this a “moderate positive” for the market, or does it still conceal downside risks?",

Government spending was softer than planned . Not_a great quarter operationally but the commentary suggests the AIrelated backlog is more of a timing issue rather than demand disappearing .

      "selftext": "Most people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong. They look at red charts, crushed valuations, and ugly sentiment and think: \"See, it was all hype. The tech doesn’t work. The economics don’t add up.\" No. The tech works. The physics work. The economics work. What doesn’t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity. # 1. Oil survives on scarcity. Clean energy survives on abundance. Oil is valuable because it is limited. You can control supply. You can restrict access. You can manipulate flows and influence pricing. That model has fed entire dynasties, countries, and corporate empires for decades. Clean energy is the opposite. You cannot corner the sun. You cannot own the wind. You cannot put a fence around photons. As you scale solar, wind, storage, and smarter grids, you move closer to something energy markets are not built to handle: practical abundance. When a resource moves toward abundance, long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage. That does not threaten the technology. It threatens the business model that ruled the last century. # 2. Old money versus new players This is not a morality play. It is a capital structure problem. Oil money has had decades to dig into governments, regulators, media, and financial systems. New clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale. They do not have the same lobbying power or political weight. So when you see pressure on clean energy stocks, it is not just \"the market is disappointed.\" It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory. Old money is not going to roll over because the physics improved. # 3. Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart People say: \"If this sector is the future, why do all these charts look like trash?\" Because the market is not just pricing tech. It is pricing resistance. The closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption, the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity. That resistance does not target one company. It hits the entire sector. So the charts move together. Mass rerates up when optimism spikes. Then mass punishment when pressure comes back in. Rinse, repeat. You are not just watching fundamentals. You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action. # 4. The transition is inevitable, but not painless Clean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason: it is better aligned with physics and long term economics. Once the upfront buildout is done, a lot of the \"fuel\" is free. Sunlight does not send an invoice. Wind does not negotiate shipping rates. But the speed of the transition is not decided only by engineers. It is decided by capital and policy. That is why you can see: * The technology already working at scale in many regions * The costs already competitive or better * Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment There is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled. # 5. What this means for investors If you look at clean energy names and only see “downtrend,” you are missing the bigger picture. Yes, the sector is volatile. Yes, many companies will fail. Yes, a lot of garbage got funded along the way. But at the structural level, you are dealing with a simple reality: * The old world is built on monetizing scarcity. * The new world is built on scaling abundance. The economic winner is obvious over decades. The path there will not be smooth, especially when trillions in old capital are on the line. This is not financial advice. It is a reminder that red charts do not automatically mean \"dead tech.\" Sometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Most people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong . They look at red charts crushed valuations and ugly sentiment and think See it was all hype . The tech doesn ’ t work . The economics don ’ t add up . No_The tech works . The physics work . The economics work . What doesn ’ t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity . 1 . Oil survives on scarcity . Clean energy survives on abundance . Oil is valuable because it is limited . You can control supply . You can restrict access . You can manipulate flows and influence pricing . That model has fed entire dynasties countries and corporate empires for decades . Clean energy is the opposite . You can not corner the sun . You can not own the wind . You can not put a fence around photons . As you scale solar wind storage and smarter grids you move closer to something energy markets are not_built to handle practical abundance . When a resource moves toward abundance long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage . That does not_threaten the technology . It threatens the business model that ruled the last century . 2 . Old money versus new players This is not_a morality play . It is a capital structure problem . Oil money has had decades to dig into governments regulators media and financial systems . New clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale . They do not_have the same lobbying power or political weight . So when you see pressure on clean energy stocks it is not_just the market is disappointed . It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory . Old money is not_going to roll over because the physics improved . 3 . Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart People say If this sector is the future why do all these charts look like trash Because the market is not_just pricing tech . It is pricing resistance . The closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity . That resistance does not_target one company . It hits the entire sector . So the charts move together . Mass rerates up when optimism spikes . Then mass punishment when pressure comes back in . Rinse repeat . You are not_just watching fundamentals . You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action . 4 . The transition is inevitable but not_painless Clean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason it is better aligned with physics and long term economics . Once the upfront buildout is done a lot of the fuel is free . Sunlight does not_send an invoice . Wind does not_negotiate shipping rates . But the speed of the transition is not_decided only by engineers . It is decided by capital and policy . That is why you can see The technology already working at scale in many regions The costs already competitive or better Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment There is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled . 5 . What this means for investors If you look at clean energy names and only see “ downtrend ” you are missing the bigger picture . Yes the sector is volatile . Yes many companies will fail . Yes a lot of garbage got funded along the way . But at the structural level you are dealing with a simple reality The old world is built on monetizing scarcity . The new world is built on scaling abundance . The economic winner is obvious over decades . The path there will not_be smooth especially when trillions in old capital are on the line . This is not_financial advice . It is a reminder that red charts do not_automatically mean dead tech . Sometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it ."

The product has well-documented reliability issues and despite that is still #1 in EV customer satisfaction. According to Consumer Reports' November 2025 survey, 86% of Rivian owners would buy again. BMW comes in second at 77%. Tesla is third at 75% with complaints about build quality. **CEO Has The Right Stuff** If you're seriously considering investing in Rivian, I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview ([Here's one]( with John Collison, founder of Stripe). I've listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews, and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic, ambitious, and competent CEOs out there. He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009. His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows. Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPO'd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around. Lucid's leadership does not hold a candle to this guy. Go watch them yourself (Marc Winterhoff, Peter Rawlinson) and see the difference. **Solid Company Culture** I don't look at Glassdoor. Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on [Blind]( Before making an investment in a tech company, I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what it's like working there. For example, I don't want to see things like \"excellent work-life balance\" or \"nepotism\" because they suggest an unproductive environment. The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fast-paced, scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently. I like that. **The R2 Is A Game-Changer** At a much more accessible $45,000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S, production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VW-backed Georgia plant. This one makes or breaks the company, and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. They're also planning a smaller, cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026. **Autonomy & AI Day On Dec 11** Rivian will likely unveil hands-free driving features, an overview of their sensor stack, and future autonomous roadmap. Not yet comparable to Tesla, but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock. **Amazon Delivery Vehicles** Rivian built about 2.5% of Amazon's fleet (30,000 vehicles) with a projection of over 10% by 2030 as gas vans are phased out. Rivian currently accounts for about 80-90% of Amazon's EV fleet. Take a look around you. If you see a cute-looking Amazon van, on the side you'll notice it's \"powered by Rivian\". **Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW** With VW's financial backing, Rivian is developing a modular, vertically-integrated EV software stack. VW already plans to use it across its brands, giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream. Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win. **Major Institutional Backing** Amazon owns 13% and VW owns 12.3% of Rivian. A welcome vote of confidence, given how closely they work together. Vanguard (6%), BlackRock (4%), UBS (1.6%) and a whole host of other well-known institutional investors are in as well. **The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation** I'll admit it - I'm an astrologer. But you can't look at this chart and say something didn't change after the last earnings call. Popped from 12-18, consolidated at 14.5-15, and headed higher all within a month. Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity. This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 12-13 again \"like it always does.\" It has steadily been making higher lows (6 separate times since Apr 2024 - roughly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and just recently 14) and once it breaks out, all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher. **Some Personal Anecdotes** * An AI/ML PhD friend of mine currently working in the self-driving space claimed that Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) is a \"long-running failure\", bought Rivian stock because he \"likes the car and company\" and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle. * My scammer ex-girlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her. I didn't, but every time we'd drive around town and she saw one she'd point at it and excitedly say \"Rivian!\" in that cute little Russian accent of hers. I don't miss her all that much, she was a complete pain in the ass. Really, I don't.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey First post on WSB . Heres why Im betting big on Rivian Customers Love The Product Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade or posts on any of the EVRivian forums or subreddits . The product has welldocumented reliability issues and despite that is still 1 in EV customer satisfaction . According to Consumer Reports November 2025 survey 86 % of Rivian owners would buy again . BMW comes in second at 77 % . Tesla is third at 75 % with complaints about build quality . CEO Has The Right Stuff If youre seriously considering investing in Rivian I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview Heres one with John Collison founder of Stripe . Ive listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic ambitious and competent CEOs out there . He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009 . His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows . Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPOd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around . Lucids leadership does not_hold a candle to this guy . Go watch them yourself Marc Winterhoff Peter Rawlinson and see the difference . Solid Company Culture I dont look at Glassdoor . Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on Blind Before making an investment in a tech company I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what its like working there . For example I dont want to see things like excellent worklife balance or nepotism because they suggest an unproductive environment . The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fastpaced scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently . I like that . The R2 Is A GameChanger At a much more accessible $ 45000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VWbacked Georgia plant . This one makes or breaks the company and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive . Theyre also planning a smaller cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026 . Autonomy AI Day On Dec 11 Rivian will likely unveil handsfree driving features an overview of their sensor stack and future autonomous roadmap . Not_yet comparable to Tesla but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock . Amazon Delivery Vehicles Rivian built about 2.5 % of Amazons fleet 30000 vehicles with a projection of over 10 % by 2030 as gas vans are phased out . Rivian currently accounts for about 8090 % of Amazons EV fleet . Take a look around you . If you see a cutelooking Amazon van on the side youll notice its powered by Rivian . Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW With VWs financial backing Rivian is developing a modular verticallyintegrated EV software stack . VW already plans to use it across its brands giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream . Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win . Major Institutional Backing Amazon owns 13 % and VW owns 12.3 % of Rivian . A welcome vote of confidence given how closely they work together . Vanguard 6 % BlackRock 4 % UBS 1.6 % and a whole host of other wellknown institutional investors are in as well . The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation Ill admit it Im an astrologer . But you cant look at this chart and say something didnt change after the last earnings call . Popped from 1218 consolidated at 14.515 and headed higher all within a month . Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity . This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 1213 again like it always does . It has steadily been making higher lows 6 separate times since Apr 2024 roughly 8 9 10 11 12 and just recently 14 and once it breaks out all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher . Some Personal Anecdotes An AIML PhD friend of mine currently working in the selfdriving space claimed that Tesla FSD Full SelfDriving is a longrunning failure bought Rivian stock because he likes the car and company and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle . My scammer exgirlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her . I didnt but every time wed drive around town and she saw one shed point at it and excitedly say Rivian in that cute little Russian accent of hers . I dont miss her all that much she was a complete pain in the ass . Really I dont ."

      "selftext": "As we all know, 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again, with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains. Personally, as far as an AI bubble is concerned, the market still has legs to run -- and empirical as this is, I don't think we'll have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind. Here's my current portfolio weights, how I'll be reallocating for the new year, and my predictions on how each will move! I'll be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year :) NVDA - 17% Nvidia continues to be my largest holding. There is significant overlap with my ETFs, but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which I'm comfortable having overweight. Doubt we will see 30+% gains after such a huge run-up though, although a 20% gain wouldn't surprise me. QQQ - 16% I've unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didn't realise there were alternatives (QQQM) with much lower expense ratios. Anyway, doesn't make sense for me to sell and buy back, but just a note for beginners. Mag 7 propelled it to 20+% gains this year, I'm predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12% gain in 2026, supported by more mid caps. VOO - 15% Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech. Predicting a healthy 9% as tech continues to outpace other sectors. AAPL - 11% The Vision Pro hasn't seen much success yet, and I think it's very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point. However, with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year, I think it'll continue to see revenue growth. Predicting a 16% upside. META - 9% Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut, hope to see more of that in the coming year. While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT. As far as I'm concerned, the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage. Share price has been relatively shaky this year, but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18%. VT - 7% Going to continue DCAing into VT, likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year. Non-US markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I don't have enough conviction to go into VXUS. Assuming global markets do better than the US, I'm projecting 11% upside. XLU - 6% My only defensive holding in utilities. Being capital-intensive, utilities should benefit greatly from a low-rate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk. Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well. Don’t expect big gains, at most 8%, just on pace with the overall market. DUOL - 5% One of my only two high-risk plays. Down from highs over 540 this year, share price has begun to consolidate. The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising long-term user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market, but this is a good long-term outlook. With a 34% 3-5 year projected EPS growth rate, I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32% gain. ANET - 3% Last but not least, my smallest holding (for now). My long-term AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have. Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns, but with the prospect of a continue, albeit slowing bull market, I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth. My guess is 35%, and I will be adding ANET/VRT on dips close to their 50MA. Let me know what you guys think about my predictions!",

      "selftext_processed": "As we all know 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains . Personally as far as an AI bubble is concerned the market still has legs to run and empirical as this is I dont think well have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind . Heres my current portfolio weights how Ill be reallocating for the new year and my predictions on how each will move Ill be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year NVDA 17 % Nvidia continues to be my largest holding . There is significant overlap with my ETFs but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which Im comfortable having overweight . Doubt we will see 30 % gains after such a huge runup though although a 20 % gain wouldnt surprise me . QQQ 16 % Ive unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didnt realise there were alternatives QQQM with much lower expense ratios . Anyway doesnt make sense for me to sell and buy back but just a note for beginners . Mag 7 propelled it to 20 % gains this year Im predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12 % gain in 2026 supported by more mid caps . VOO 15 % Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech . Predicting a healthy 9 % as tech continues to outpace other sectors . AAPL 11 % The Vision Pro hasnt seen much success yet and I think its very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point . However with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year I think itll continue to see revenue growth . Predicting a 16 % upside . META 9 % Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut hope to see more of that in the coming year . While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now I dont think itll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT . As far as Im concerned the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage . Share price has been relatively shaky this year but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18 % . VT 7 % Going to continue DCAing into VT likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year . NonUS markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I dont have enough conviction to go into VXUS . Assuming global markets do better than the US Im projecting 11 % upside . XLU 6 % My only defensive holding in utilities . Being capitalintensive utilities should benefit greatly from a lowrate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk . Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well . Don ’ t expect big gains at most 8 % just on pace with the overall market . DUOL 5 % One of my only two highrisk plays . Down from highs over 540 this year share price has begun to consolidate . The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising longterm user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market but this is a good longterm outlook . With a 34 % 35 year projected EPS growth rate I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32 % gain . ANET 3 % Last but not_least my smallest holding for now . My longterm AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have . Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns but with the prospect of a continue albeit slowing bull market I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth . My guess is 35 % and I will be adding ANETVRT on dips close to their 50MA . Let me know what you guys think about my predictions"

      "selftext": "Netflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.” Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion. The breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.",

      "selftext": "The stock market seems to be catching its breath after the early December shakeup, while Major indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posted modest gains today as bond yields and the dollar stabilized, Investor sentiment is creeping out of the deep end, less panic, but not yet bullish euphoria. Big cap tech remains the backbone, while Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL are holding steady, while Tesla TSLA shows early signs of recovery after recent volatility. The mood is uneven, Some stocks shows technical strength, Alphabet’s stock, for example, is coiling inside a triangle ahead of a key data release, while others remain pressured by macro headwinds, high valuations, and mixed earnings reports, The market feels like it’s trying to decide whether this bounce marks a real recovery or just another lower high, Interestingly, the broader conversation about the future of stocks is evolving as well because even Nasdaq’s crypto chief mentioned they’re moving as fast as they can to get SEC approval for trading tokenized stocks, and some platforms like bitget have already started experimenting with on chain stock trading and related incentives. Right now, everything looks fragile on the surface, but the underlying structure isn’t broken. Big cap tech is guarding major ranges, a few beaten down stocks are showing early signs of life, and macro signals hint at potential rate cuts. If this consolidation holds, the rest of December could still surprise, but caution is still warranted, It’s worth noting that the evolving infrastructure for tokenized or on chain stock trading, even with zero fee experiments or rewards programs, which is part of the bigger picture shaping how investors might participate in equities in the near future.",

Big cap tech remains the backbone while Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL are holding steady while Tesla TSLA shows early signs of recovery after recent volatility . The mood is uneven Some stocks shows technical strength Alphabet ’ s stock for example is coiling inside a triangle ahead of a key data release while others remain pressured by macro headwinds high valuations and mixed earnings reports The market feels like it ’ s trying to decide whether this bounce marks a real recovery or just another lower high Interestingly the broader conversation about the future of stocks is evolving as well because even Nasdaq ’ s crypto chief mentioned they ’ re moving as fast as they can to get SEC approval for trading tokenized stocks and some platforms like bitget have already started experimenting with on chain stock trading and related incentives . Right now everything looks fragile on the surface but the underlying structure isn ’ t broken . Big cap tech is guarding major ranges a few beaten down stocks are showing early signs of life and macro signals hint at potential rate cuts . If this consolidation holds the rest of December could still surprise but caution is still warranted It ’ s worth noting that the evolving infrastructure for tokenized or on chain stock trading even with zero fee experiments or rewards programs which is part of the bigger picture shaping how investors might participate in equities in the near future ."

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

      "selftext": "Moore Threads had a massive first day in Shanghai, jumping more than 400% after its $1.1 billion IPO. It’s one of the biggest debuts for a Chinese chip company this year and comes at a time when Beijing is pushing hard to build a domestic GPU ecosystem. The timing matters. With U.S. sanctions limiting China’s access to advanced manufacturing, companies like Moore Threads, Huawei, and Cambricon are all stepping in to fill the gap. China clearly wants local alternatives that can support AI, gaming, and data-center workloads without depending on U.S. suppliers. Moore Threads still has a long way to go in matching the performance of global leaders, but the market’s reaction shows how much enthusiasm there is behind China’s semiconductor push. The broader chip sector in China has been accelerating, with new entrants and established players all competing for the same growing demand. Curious what everyone thinks is this early hype or a sign that China’s GPU ecosystem is finally gaining real momentum? Source: [",

      "title": "Bloomberg: Morgan Stanley Considers Offloading Some of Its Data-Center Exposure",
      "selftext": "Morgan Stanley, one of the key players in financing the artificial-intelligence race, is considering offloading some of its data-center exposure via a so-called significant risk transfer. The bank has held preliminary talks with potential investors about an SRT tied to a portfolio of loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. SRTs backed by data-center exposure are still a nascent slice of the credit-risk transfer market, where banks hedge their credit exposure, manage capital ratios and free up balance-sheet capacity for more lending by selling credit-linked notes to institutional investors. Morgan Stanley is also exploring other ways to hedge or syndicate part of its data-center risk, the people said, and there is no guarantee the early-stage SRT talks will result in a deal. Morgan Stanley in October arranged over $27 billion of debt and about $2.5 billion of equity financing for a special-purpose vehicle tied to the development of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Hyperion data-center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The bank also led three recent junk-bond offerings from TeraWulf Inc., Cipher Mining Inc., and Applied Digital Corp. in which the proceeds were earmarked in part to help finance the construction of new data-center facilities. Morgan Stanley strategists forecast big cloud computing companies will spend about $3 trillion on data-center infrastructure projects through 2028. Cash flow can fund only about half of that, the bank estimates, with most of the rest raised via debt markets. The lending surge may leave banks overexposed to a small group of companies.

      "selftext_processed": "Morgan Stanley one of the key players in financing the artificialintelligence race is considering offloading some of its datacenter exposure via a socalled significant risk transfer . The bank has held preliminary talks with potential investors about an SRT tied to a portfolio of loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure according to people with knowledge of the matter who asked not_to be identified because the information is confidential . SRTs backed by datacenter exposure are still a nascent slice of the creditrisk transfer market where banks hedge their credit exposure manage capital ratios and free up balancesheet capacity for more lending by selling creditlinked notes to institutional investors . Morgan Stanley is also exploring other ways to hedge or syndicate part of its datacenter risk the people said and there is no_guarantee the earlystage SRT talks will result in a deal . Morgan Stanley in October arranged over $ 27 billion of debt and about $ 2.5 billion of equity financing for a specialpurpose vehicle tied to the development of Meta Platforms Inc. ’ s Hyperion datacenter site in Richland Parish Louisiana . The bank also led three recent junkbond offerings from TeraWulf Inc. Cipher Mining Inc. and Applied Digital Corp. in which the proceeds were earmarked in part to help finance the construction of new datacenter facilities . Morgan Stanley strategists forecast big cloud computing companies will spend about $ 3 trillion on datacenter infrastructure projects through 2028 . Cash flow can fund only about half of that the bank estimates with most of the rest raised via debt markets . The lending surge may leave banks overexposed to a small group of companies .

Larry Fink, the CEO of BlackRock, is also calling for the next evolution in market infrastructure, saying tokenization will transform finance. And everybody with a brain still firing neurons knows that tokenization will mainly happen on Ethereum. Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won’t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and non-lenient. Thankfully, decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that, because digital is the future, and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past, outside of the decentralized, democratized blockchain. Despite the biggest dogs calling for a financial revolution built on Ethereum, Ethereum has been flat for the last 5 years. This is your final chance to get your supercharged Ethereum golden ticket, BMNR, before the biggest evolution in market infrastructure reprices Ethereum forever.",

Larry Fink the CEO of BlackRock is also calling for the next evolution in market infrastructure saying tokenization will transform finance . And everybody with a brain still firing neurons knows that tokenization will mainly happen on Ethereum . Traditional stock platforms take days to settle and won ’ t even allow you to swap one share for another — the current financial market is slow and nonlenient . Thankfully decentralized and trustworthy Ethereum and their smart contracts are finally ready to change that because digital is the future and the financial markets are currently stuck in the centralized past outside of the decentralized democratized blockchain . Despite the biggest dogs calling for a financial revolution built on Ethereum Ethereum has been flat for the last 5 years . This is your final chance to get your supercharged Ethereum golden ticket BMNR before the biggest evolution in market infrastructure reprices Ethereum forever ."

      "selftext": "From doing past analysis, I realized that most people, including myself, miss out on life-changing huge gains because we sell our stocks too early. There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100-200% and some over 5Y went up 1000%-3000%. One thing I noticed people like to do is day-trade or swing-trade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days. They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly. But then afterwards, the stock that they just sold ends up going up +30% in one day suddenly, then continues to go up consistently day by day, +5%, +7%, +3%... and so on, eventually before you know it, the stock has already went up +100%. Personally, I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buy-and-hold approach. I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future. Hence, I try my absolute best not to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dips/crashes, or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential.",

For some reason I have this fear about triggering conversions of realized losses into wash sale losses even if they’re outside of the 60-day window. In the following scenario, how much would my wash sale amount be? 1 March: I sell my entire position (100 shares) for a $100 realized loss; 1 April: I re-buy 100 shares of the stock (30 days’ past so no wash sale); 15 April: I sell 50 of the 100 shares of the stock for a $50 loss. I know the 15 April $50 loss would count as a wash sale against the remaining 50 shares purchased on 1 April, but would the 1 March $100 losses stay as realized losses or would they also be converted to wash sale losses?",

It suggests that the market isn't expecting a lot of volatility (large market moves). It seems strange to me to see fear indicators and at the same time little expectation of volatility. Of course the VIX is more of a trailing than leading indicator. Seems like not a bad time to buy some VXX, to hedge against a market panic. Opinions? Edit: To clarify, I'm not talking about selling holding to try to make a short term play. I'm interested in making a small side bet to profit against a market panic.",

It suggests that the market isnt expecting a lot of volatility large market moves . It seems strange to me to see fear indicators and at the same time little expectation of volatility . Of course the VIX is more of a trailing than leading indicator . Seems like not_a bad time to buy some VXX to hedge against a market panic . Opinions Edit To clarify Im not_talking about selling holding to try to make a short term play . Im interested in making a small side bet to profit against a market panic ."

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries . MY POSITION 200 Contracts of the $ 10 Strike Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $ 3.5 in premiums for a total of $ 71712 TLDR ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdownbig potential catalyst . Education is huge in China households spend 17 % of income on it 5x global avg . Reopening the sector helps job creation consumption and talent development . ﻿﻿If rules loosen TAL EDU become a nearduopoly due to heavy compliance barriers ﻿﻿Stock has been rangebound $ 8 $ 11 but sentiment policy tone in China is improving . Im in Jan 2027 $ 10 calls 200 contracts $ 72K as a longterm bet ."

      "title": "Japan's interest rate hike may trigger a major shock to global markets, signaling the end of the era of low interest rates!",
      "selftext": "Everyone's been focused on the Federal Reserve's actions lately, but what could truly ignite global markets this month isn't Washington, but Tokyo. This country, dormant for over 20 years, is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows. Over the past week, Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends, with the 30-year rate hitting a record high, the 10-year rate breaking a 17-year high, and even the 20-year rate reaching multi-year highs. For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates, this is no longer just market volatility, but a complete interest rate restart. More importantly, Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time, directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting. This sudden change has triggered high market tension, because last August, when Japan only slightly raised interest rates, global markets overreacted instantly, experiencing massive asset sell-offs. At that time, US stocks plummeted, Bitcoin was severely impacted, and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars. This time, it seems Japan is truly preparing to \"walk,\" and may even start \"running.\" How much impact will this have on global capital flows? For the past 30 years, the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation. However, since 2023, core CPI has been rising steadily, wage growth has exceeded 3%, and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991. This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases. But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery, if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates, the yen will continue to depreciate significantly, severely impacting Japan's import costs and corporate profits. Therefore, Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hard-won economic structure. The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the market's reaction. This strategy itself is a financial stress test; the market is no longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates, but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows. The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on low-interest-rate funds from Japan. Now, if Japan raises interest rates, this capital chain will begin to reverse, and global assets will face the risk of repricing. Why would this trigger a stampede? Because in the past, global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade, using low-interest-rate funds to invest in higher-yield assets (such as US stocks, US bonds, and Bitcoin). If the yen appreciates, these funds will have to be withdrawn, potentially triggering a massive asset sell-off. When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly, global financial market volatility will be even more severe. Last August's interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen, but it already triggered a sharp market reaction. This time, the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow, particularly from US and tech stocks, as well as high-risk assets globally. Whenever Japan raises interest rates, global investment portfolios will face reassessment, especially those high-risk assets reliant on low-cost funding. As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer, global markets are already preparing for a possible \"unwinding wave.\" Markets are becoming increasingly nervous, and investors are beginning to withdraw from high-risk assets, particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin. In the coming months, global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike, far exceeding the impact of fundamentals. Therefore, what truly needs attention now is not whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyones been focused on the Federal Reserves actions lately but what could truly ignite global markets this month isnt Washington but Tokyo . This country dormant for over 20 years is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows . Over the past week Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends with the 30year rate hitting a record high the 10year rate breaking a 17year high and even the 20year rate reaching multiyear highs . For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates this is no_longer just market volatility but a complete interest rate restart . More importantly Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting . This sudden change has triggered high market tension because last August when Japan only slightly raised interest rates global markets overreacted instantly experiencing massive asset selloffs . At that time US stocks plummeted Bitcoin was severely impacted and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars . This time it seems Japan is truly preparing to walk and may even start running . How much impact will this have on global capital flows For the past 30 years the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation . However since 2023 core CPI has been rising steadily wage growth has exceeded 3 % and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991 . This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases . But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates the yen will continue to depreciate significantly severely impacting Japans import costs and corporate profits . Therefore Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hardwon economic structure . The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the markets reaction . This strategy itself is a financial stress test the market is no_longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows . The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on lowinterestrate funds from Japan . Now if Japan raises interest rates this capital chain will begin to reverse and global assets will face the risk of repricing . Why would this trigger a stampede Because in the past global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade using lowinterestrate funds to invest in higheryield assets such as US stocks US bonds and Bitcoin . If the yen appreciates these funds will have to be withdrawn potentially triggering a massive asset selloff . When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly global financial market volatility will be even more severe . Last Augusts interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen but it already triggered a sharp market reaction . This time the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow particularly from US and tech stocks as well as highrisk assets globally . Whenever Japan raises interest rates global investment portfolios will face reassessment especially those highrisk assets reliant on lowcost funding . As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer global markets are already preparing for a possible unwinding wave . Markets are becoming increasingly nervous and investors are beginning to withdraw from highrisk assets particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin . In the coming months global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike far exceeding the impact of fundamentals . Therefore what truly needs attention now is not_whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike ."

      "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 4 (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O), CEO Lisa Su on Thursday said the company has licenses to ship some of its MI 308 chips to China and is prepared to pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government if it ships them. Su made the remarks at a conference held by technology publication Wired in San Francisco. U.S. President Donald Trump in August said his administration had reached a deal with Nvidia (NVDA.O), and AMD under which they could resume shipping some chips to China in exchange for paying a 15% fee, a move some legal experts argued could violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on taxing exports.

U.S. President Donald Trump in August said his administration had reached a deal with Nvidia NVDA.O and AMD under which they could resume shipping some chips to China in exchange for paying a 15 % fee a move some legal experts argued could violate the U.S. Constitutions ban on taxing exports .

      "selftext": "Apple’s general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, will retire from Apple, the company announced on Thursday. Apple said that Jennifer Newstead would become Apple’s new general counsel in March next year and that Jackson’s government affairs staff would report to her. The two executives previously reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook and represent the latest sign that Apple’s senior leadership is seeing a slew of exits. In recent weeks, Apple’s head software designer said he was leaving to go to Meta, Apple said that its AI chief was retiring, and Apple’s chief operating officer retired. Adams joined Apple and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company’s privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store’s restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company’s diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Prior to joining Apple in 2013, she spent four years as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. In that role, Jackson “focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,” according to her bio on Apple’s website. Jackson was instrumental in Apple’s launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company’s equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report on the initiative in 2023. “At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,” Jackson wrote in a section of that report. “We won’t delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.” Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Source: [",

The Yahoo Finance seems like it works, but I'm concerned it might be providing adjusted values, because they seem very similar. For example if I look at Apple for April 2nd in 1990, it shows me $0.36 for the close. But the header says \"Close price adjusted for splits\" and then there's also an 'Adj. Close' column beside that. So it seems confusing for them both to say they're adjusted. I'm just looking to find out how I can get verifiable, unadjusted actual price of a stock for a given day.",

      "selftext": "MoonLake ($MLTX) is soaring today, and I believe we are just getting started. This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now, and a run-up to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th. Thesis (TL;DR): MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90%—because the market hyper-focused on a single narrowly missed endpoint, not the whole data set. Under the surface, sonelokimab (SLK) hit consistent, significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases, with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks. This is one of those rare moments where “disaster” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity. Data & Why the Panic Is Overdone: • VELA-1: Big win. Mid-30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo, all core secondaries positive. • VELA-2: Drug effect consistent with VELA-1, but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread (p ≈ .05). All secondary endpoints still positive; combined analysis is strongly significant (p < 0.001). []( [SLK HS VELA Trial Data]( • Takeaway: High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials. Look at the totality: consistent drug effect, positive secondaries, and durable benefit, not “dead drug.” More Than HS: Platform Upside (4 Indications):SLK is not a one-trick pony. MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications, including: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): Adult and adolescent, with long-term extension data. • Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP): LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive, immediate pipeline upgrade. • Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA): S-OLARIS readout Q1 2026. • Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): IZAR Phase 3, 2026. Upcoming Catalysts (Why Act Now): • Dec 15, 2025: FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application. A “yes” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher, while a “not without additional data” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90% one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year. • Q4 2025: LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform, not just HS. • Q1–Q2 2026: S-OLARIS (axSpA), VELA-TEEN/long-term HS, IZAR (PsA). You basically have a week or two to get a thesis-confirming or thesis-breaking regulatory answer—at panic-level valuations. Balance Sheet: MoonLake isn’t hurting for cash. They have hundreds of millions on hand, a fresh $75M raise, with extended runway into 2027. You’re not waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst; you’re waiting for data, and more data is coming imminently. Lawsuit/FUD Section (for the Record):Yes, the numerous class actions headlines exist: they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed, if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response. In biotech, legal and headline risk is always present post-drop, but those lawsuits don’t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon. The lawsuits are noise; the SLK’s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal. Risks: • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn. • LEDA readout/other pipeline indications could go nowhere and this is still a one-asset, high-volatility biotech—but I like the data so far. Asymmetric Setup: Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what’s not priced in is a credible FDA greenlight, positive PPP data, and the multi-indication platform angle. The next two catalysts (FDA and LEDA) will likely decide if this rerates violently higher, in the very near term. This window, with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits, could close fast. Part of the reason I'm so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock, which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline \"miss\". The data is there - SLK works, the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesn't work. But the data says it does, and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not just HS, but also PPP, PsA, axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesn't work. I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher, and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one. [I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—I'm posting this one.]( Disclosure: I (obviously) own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options, my kids even own MLTX. **I like the stock.** I don't know your personal financial situation, this is not financial advice.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake $ MLTX is soaring today and I believe we are just getting started . This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now and a runup to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th . Thesis TLDR MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90 % —because the market hyperfocused on a single narrowly missed endpoint not_the whole data set . Under the surface sonelokimab SLK hit consistent significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks . This is one of those rare moments where “ disaster ” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity . Data Why the Panic Is Overdone • VELA1 Big win . Mid30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo all core secondaries positive . • VELA2 Drug effect consistent with VELA1 but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread p ≈ .05 . All secondary endpoints still positive combined analysis is strongly significant p 0.001 . SLK HS VELA Trial Data • Takeaway High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials . Look at the totality consistent drug effect positive secondaries and durable benefit not_ “ dead drug. ” More Than HS Platform Upside 4 IndicationsSLK is not_a onetrick pony . MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications including • Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Adult and adolescent with longterm extension data . • Palmoplantar Pustulosis PPP LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive immediate pipeline upgrade . • Axial Spondyloarthritis axSpA SOLARIS readout Q1 2026 . • Psoriatic Arthritis PsA IZAR Phase 3 2026 . Upcoming Catalysts Why Act Now • Dec 15 2025 FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application . A “ yes ” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher while a “ not without additional data ” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90 % one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year . • Q4 2025 LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform not_just HS . • Q1–Q2 2026 SOLARIS axSpA VELATEENlongterm HS IZAR PsA . You basically have a week or two to get a thesisconfirming or thesisbreaking regulatory answer—at paniclevel valuations . Balance Sheet MoonLake isn ’ t hurting for cash . They have hundreds of millions on hand a fresh $ 75M raise with extended runway into 2027 . You ’ re not_waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst you ’ re waiting for data and more data is coming imminently . LawsuitFUD Section for the RecordYes the numerous class actions headlines exist they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response . In biotech legal and headline risk is always present postdrop but those lawsuits don ’ t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon . The lawsuits are noise the SLK ’ s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal . Risks • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn . • LEDA readoutother pipeline indications could go nowhere_and this is still a oneasset highvolatility biotech—but I like the data so far . Asymmetric Setup Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what ’ s not_priced in is a credible FDA greenlight positive PPP data and the multiindication platform angle . The next two catalysts FDA and LEDA will likely decide if this rerates violently higher in the very near term . This window with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits could close fast . Part of the reason Im so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline miss . The data is there SLK works the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesnt work . But the data says it does and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not_just HS but also PPP PsA axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesnt work . I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one . I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—Im posting this one . Disclosure I obviously own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options my kids even own MLTX . I like the stock . I dont know your personal financial situation this is not_financial advice . Do your own research ."

I realize they have an absolutely massive geyser of cash from their advertising but why did sinking tens of billions into the metaverse several years ago never seem to depress their income? I assume they're capitalizing most of it but even so, shouldn't a huge project that doesn't generate a fraction of the revenue they thought it would depress earnings in later years? Did the advertising business just so happened to grow at a rate that canceled all that spending out?",

      "title": "[DD] WIX: The Market Says \"Dead Legacy Tech.\" The Math Says \"Rule of 40\" Cash Cow (9x EV/FCF).",
      "selftext": "I've been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive, and I kept ignoring **Wix (WIX)**. Like most of you, I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify. But I finally dug into their 10-Ks and updated guidance for 2025, and honestly, the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment. It looks like a classic capital return play that's being priced like a distressed asset. I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if I'm missing something obvious. Here is the raw math I’m looking at: 1. They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise. I thought they were unprofitable. Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and it's showing up in the GAAP numbers. Check out the Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin ramp: * **2022:** 2% (Barely broke even at $32M) * **2023:** 16% ($246M) * **2024:** 28% ($488M) * **2025 (Est):** 30%+ (On track for \\~$600M) Basically, they hit the \"Rule of 40\" way faster than anyone expected, but the stock price hasn't really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow. 2. The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30% margins, they usually trade at a premium. WIX is in the basement. * **WIX is trading at \\~9.0x EV/FCF.** * **The median for their peer group is around 14.2x.** * **The \"Quality\" names trade at 15-25x.** Even if you don't think WIX is a \"premium\" asset, a 40% discount to the *median* seems excessive for a company printing $600M a year in cash. 3. The \"AI Risk\" might be backwards The bear case is always \"AI will make website builders obsolete.\" I looked into this, and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now. Two things stood out in the segments: 1. **Partners (Agencies):** This isn't DIY revenue. This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients. It grew at a **30% CAGR** and hit **$610M** in 2024. This revenue is way stickier than the churn-heavy DIY stuff. 2. **Base44:** They bought/launched this AI app builder recently. It went from **300k users in June '25 to 2 Million in October**. I haven't modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe, but it gives them a foot in the door of the $25B low-code market. Valuation / Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins (low 30s) and keep growing revenue at a boring 15%. My model spits out an intrinsic value of around **$170**. Even if I'm wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow, the stock should be significantly higher than $96. **Where could I be wrong? (Bear Case)** I'm trying to kill this trade before I size up. * Obviously, Shopify is the elephant in the room. WIX seems to be winning on \"services\" websites vs. pure e-commerce, but the overlap is scary. * Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026? If the macro turns, their churn could look ugly fast. Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently? Am I overestimating the stickiness there? **Disclosure:** Long WIX. **Reference:** I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive and I kept ignoring Wix WIX . Like most of you I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify . But I finally dug into their 10Ks and updated guidance for 2025 and honestly the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment . It looks like a classic capital return play thats being priced like a distressed asset . I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if Im missing something obvious . Here is the raw math I ’ m looking at 1 . They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise . I thought they were unprofitable . Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and its showing up in the GAAP numbers . Check out the Free Cash Flow FCF margin ramp 2022 2 % Barely broke even at $ 32M 2023 16 % $ 246M 2024 28 % $ 488M 2025 Est 30 % On track for $ 600M Basically they hit the Rule of 40 way faster than anyone expected but the stock price hasnt really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow . 2 . The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30 % margins they usually trade at a premium . WIX is in the basement . WIX is trading at 9.0x EVFCF . The median for their peer group is around 14.2x . The Quality names trade at 1525x . Even if you dont think WIX is a premium asset a 40 % discount to the median seems excessive for a company printing $ 600M a year in cash . 3 . The AI Risk might be backwards The bear case is always AI will make website builders obsolete . I looked into this and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now . Two things stood out in the segments 1 . Partners Agencies This isnt DIY revenue . This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients . It grew at a 30 % CAGR and hit $ 610M in 2024 . This revenue is way stickier than the churnheavy DIY stuff . 2 . Base44 They boughtlaunched this AI app builder recently . It went from 300k users in June 25 to 2 Million in October . I havent modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe but it gives them a foot in the door of the $ 25B lowcode market . Valuation Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins low 30s and keep growing revenue at a boring 15 % . My model spits out an intrinsic value of around $ 170 . Even if Im wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow the stock should be significantly higher than $ 96 . Where could I be wrong Bear Case Im trying to kill this trade before I size up . Obviously Shopify is the elephant in the room . WIX seems to be winning on services websites vs. pure ecommerce but the overlap is scary . Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026 If the macro turns their churn could look ugly fast . Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently Am I overestimating the stickiness there Disclosure Long WIX . Reference I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog"

Because I've watched too many people ride winners back to zero waiting for \"just a bit more.\" The greed is real and it kills portfolios. That said - I break this rule for stuff I'm actually long on. Real estate that's throwing off cash? Not selling. Solana I'm staking? Staying put. Quality dividend plays? Those compound forever. But random defi yields, momentum stocks, anything that smells like hype? 70% and gone. No second thoughts. Basically: exit the bets, hold the investments.

Take a look at r/HealthInsurance and you will see people talking about how premiums are tripling or even worse just for bad insurance. Do you think the current admin will step in and fund these companies, driving the costs down for consumers. Or, will it not, and people will not have insurance. If the government steps in, then you could make a lot of money by going long on healthcare stocks. If not, healthy people will go without insurance, driving the prices for the elderly/sick higher. Further it could cause small business owners to close shop and find a job that contributes to their insurance. This could affect a large portion of the market by funneling more money into bigger companies. Let me know what you think.",

      "selftext": "Amazon is considering terminating its long-term contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to instead establish its own nationwide competitive delivery network. The existing agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two parties have spent months negotiating the next version of the contract, but talks have become complicated due to President Trump's push to privatize the USPS. Under the current deal, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency's projected 2025 revenue. This agreement plays a crucial role in the USPS's financial model. However, Amazon already operates an extensive transportation network, including aircraft, Rivian electric vans, and an emerging drone delivery service though the drone project has faced multiple challenges this year, including a recent investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. It is also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox, further strengthening its control over last mile delivery. Should Amazon decide to terminate its partnership with the USPS, it could have significant implications for the logistics industry. As Amazon bolsters its logistics network, will companies like Rivian and Zoox see further growth opportunities?",

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve's growing pressure for further rate cuts is gradually brightening the outlook for emerging market assets next year. Fidelity International stated: “If 2025 is a strong year for emerging markets, just wait for 2026.” This asset manager, overseeing over $1 trillion in assets, is joining a growing number of Wall Street banks betting that a weaker dollar will drive returns in developing-market assets next year. Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last year's rate hikes. While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year, substantial capital remains unallocated. This may lay the groundwork for 2026, where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations. Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets? After all, these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential. But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets' 2025 performance. Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 (according to MSCI indices). We know the dollar and euro often move inversely, and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness. In contrast, Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound. Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality, with many believing greater market opportunities exist here.",

Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last years rate hikes . While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year substantial capital remains unallocated . This may lay the groundwork for 2026 where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations . Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets After all these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential . But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets 2025 performance . Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 according to MSCI indices . We know the dollar and euro often move inversely and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley Bank of America and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness . In contrast Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound . Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality with many believing greater market opportunities exist here ."

The restructuring would likely include layoffs as Meta continues shifting resources away from its earlier metaverse ambitions and into AI, efficiency, and core products. The pivot isn’t surprising. Meta rebranded back in 2021 to bet big on the metaverse, but investor enthusiasm cooled fast as the unit racked up heavy losses. With AI now dominating Big Tech strategy (and Meta’s own AI efforts gaining traction), it looks like the company is tightening spending where returns have been the weakest. If these cuts go through, it would mark one of the clearest signs yet that Meta is prioritizing near-term profitability and AI capability over its longer-term virtual world vision. Anyone else think this is Meta admitting the metaverse bet just isn’t paying off or is this just a natural rebalancing of resources? Source: [",

The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities. >The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound ⁠in Hawaii last month, Bloomberg reported. >Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January, according to the report. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment. >\"Smart move, just late,\" said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber. \"This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought ​years ago.\" >The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality ‌headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. >Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community. >However, it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses, as competitors such as Alphabet's Google, [Apple]( and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts. >The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. >To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year. Overall, large tech companies are expected to spend around $400 billion on AI this year. >The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with million-dollar pay packages.",

      "selftext_processed": "Np paywall Meta is expected to make budget cuts of up to 30 % for its metaverse initiative Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people ​familiar with the discussions . The Facebook parents shares rose 4 % as the move eased ‌some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars only for the ‌business to burn more than $ 60 billion since 2020 . The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities . The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the companys annual budget planning for 2026 which included a series of meetings at Zuckerbergs compound ⁠in Hawaii last month Bloomberg reported . Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January according to the report . Meta did not_immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment . Smart move just late said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber . This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not_as prosperous as management thought ​years ago . The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs which produces the companys Quest mixedreality ‌headsets smart glasses made with EssilorLuxotticas RayBan and upcoming augmentedreality glasses . Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community . However it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses as competitors such as Alphabets Google Apple and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts . The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valleys artificialintelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception . To fuel its ambitious goals Meta has committed as much as $ 72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year . Overall large tech companies are expected to spend around $ 400 billion on AI this year . The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with milliondollar pay packages ."

      "selftext": "Alcoa's (AA) stock price has recently shown a strong rally, climbing over 18% in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025. This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6% on December 3, 2025, reaching $44.09. This upward trend follows strong third-quarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts. Notably, the company has secured a 10-year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York. Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies, particularly data centers and batteries. The AI build-out is a major new demand driver for aluminum. Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks, cooling units, and radiators, as demand for the metal soars. In the battery sector, the global aluminum-based battery market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market, as the market is forecast to grow from $5 billion to over $12 billion by 2032. ...and one of the best things I've heard from the Investor's Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its non-used sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations. .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turn-around story for them?",

      "selftext_processed": "Alcoas AA stock price has recently shown a strong rally climbing over 18 % in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025 . This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6 % on December 3 2025 reaching $ 44.09 . This upward trend follows strong thirdquarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts . Notably the company has secured a 10year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York . Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies particularly data centers and batteries . The AI buildout is a major new demand driver for aluminum . Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks cooling units and radiators as demand for the metal soars . In the battery sector the global aluminumbased battery market is projected to grow significantly driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market as the market is forecast to grow from $ 5 billion to over $ 12 billion by 2032 . ... and one of the best things Ive heard from the Investors Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its nonused sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations . .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turnaround story for them"

I've been doing this for the last 9 years now and considering it's costing an average of $30k to purchase the house with deposits etc etc this is a return of roughly 8% give or take . Let's say prices rise 2-3% per year it's a 10-11% return . For the simplicity of it all is this why people just get an average of 10% in the stock market each year ? It seems like a crazy amount of work on my property end to make what people are in the S&P500 . I know the stock market goes up and down and end up averaging out but if I'm looking at the next 20years . What's everyone's thoughts on steering more toward the stocks market purely because it doubles every 9years or so on average I know . House prices I don't see doubling every 9-10year . Am I missing something here ? I'll add in that I've had a very successful run with property just wondering if it's time to park the $ in stocks rather than more roofs",

      "title": "if Tesla is just auto + energy till 2030, is mid-440s cheap or a joke?",
      "selftext": "I’ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow. Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful, and somehow the price just refuses to die. Since October it’s actually held up better than I expected: it was around $456 back then, dropped into the high $380s in November, bounced back to ~430, and now it’s sitting in the mid-440s. After all that noise, it’s basically only a small step down from October. What’s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn’t sounded great. I remember a bunch of pieces about “margins getting crushed” and “Tesla losing its EV lead” as cheaper EVs (especially from China) grabbed share. In places like France and Sweden, sales were down something like 40–50% YoY, and I just saw another article saying that in the UK, November sales were down about 19%, yet TSLA still roughly up 4%. After Q3, the stock did sell off for a bit, which kind of matched the mood: GAAP operating income down ~40% YoY, operating margin ~5.8%, total gross margin ~18%, auto gross margin ex-credits only mid-teens vs close to 30% at the peak. Revenue hit a record, but net income was still down ~35–40% YoY. The one real bright spot was they printed almost $4B in free cash flow and have over $40B in cash, so the balance sheet doesn’t really scare me. Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “very good” auto + energy business, I just can’t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety. For me to get more comfortable, I’d want either a clear trend of margin recovery, or the AI / FSD / robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the P&L instead of just keynotes and hype. So I’m honestly curious: if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto + energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis / robots aren’t huge before 2030, what kind of PE would you put on that? Under that assumption, is today’s price cheap, fair, or just straight-up expensive to you? And if I butchered any of these stats, feel free to correct me in the comments. aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff, this was the dashboard I was looking at: [Tesla UK sales down ~19% in November, New Automotive data shows.](",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow . Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful and somehow the price just refuses to die . Since October it ’ s actually held up better than I expected it was around $ 456 back then dropped into the high $ 380s in November bounced back to 430 and now it ’ s sitting in the mid440s . After all that noise it ’ s basically only a small step down from October . What ’ s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn ’ t sounded great . I remember a bunch of pieces about “ margins getting crushed ” and “ Tesla losing its EV lead ” as cheaper EVs especially from China grabbed share . In places like France and Sweden sales were down something like 40–50 % YoY and I just saw another article saying that in the UK November sales were down about 19 % yet TSLA still roughly up 4 % . After Q3 the stock did sell off for a bit which kind of matched the mood GAAP operating income down 40 % YoY operating margin 5.8 % total gross margin 18 % auto gross margin excredits only midteens vs close to 30 % at the peak . Revenue hit a record but net income was still down 35–40 % YoY . The one real bright spot was they printed almost $ 4B in free cash flow and have over $ 40B in cash so the balance sheet doesn ’ t really scare me . Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “ very good ” auto energy business I just can ’ t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety . For me to get more comfortable I ’ d want either a clear trend of margin recovery or the AI FSD robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the PL instead of just keynotes and hype . So I ’ m honestly curious if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis robots aren ’ t huge before 2030 what kind of PE would you put on that Under that assumption is today ’ s price cheap fair or just straightup expensive to you And if I butchered any of these stats feel free to correct me in the comments . aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff this was the dashboard I was looking at Tesla UK sales down 19 % in November New Automotive data shows ."

In the best case, I would make around an 11% profit if I sold during the buyback. However, I currently receive about a 10% dividend per year after taxes (based on the tax rules in my country). At the moment, I would not sell. I have held the stock for 12 months already, which means I have already gotten back 10% of my purchase price through dividends.

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then it's really hard to know if they actually own what they're talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow, just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably won't work out. I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe I'm not figuring out how to use it right? Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept it's not designed for serious analysis, what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment",

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then its really hard to know if they actually own what theyre talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably wont work out . I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe Im not_figuring out how to use it right Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept its not_designed for serious analysis what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment"

The only worrying and troubling thing is Charter Communications has billions and billions og dollars of debt on its current balance. I understand that this particular industry is very capital intensive, but this ​it still gives me pause. There is also the risk that in the medium term, Charter could lose customers to other companies in the industry. However, I'm still going to undertake a deep dive and do a full due diligence on the company and its stock. And, I must admit that when I crunch the numbers, I'm going to be very conservative in my estimates. 😊😊😊😊",

Now I just stare at the chart sometimes and sigh. I’m starting to sketch out ideas for 2026. Thinking about leaning a bit more into dividend stocks and maybe some international ETFs, but not sure yet. So, curious to hear from other people. What was your best investment in 2025?

      "selftext": "Japan’s 10-year JGB yield touched 1.917% on Thursday the highest level since 2007. It’s basically the market’s way of signaling that investors aren’t fully convinced about the Bank of Japan’s current policy path. The BOJ is stuck between two bad options: Raise rates further: yields likely push even higher, tightening conditions at a time when parts of the economy are still fragile. Cut or stay on hold: risks re-accelerating inflation after spending most of the decade trying to get it under control. It’s one of those situations where any direction introduces new problems. The next BOJ meeting should be interesting because the window for “gentle normalization” looks like it’s narrowing fast. Source:",

      "selftext": "As of 2025, the amount of ETFs that exist on the US stock exchanges has surpassed the amount of stocks. Honestly, this surprised me and I didn't realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up. ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion, you used to be able to refer to them as the \"safer\" option to invest in, but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products, it's even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks. When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage, or 2x short Tesla, it's actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information. If people are willing to pay for products, companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that. [",

Honestly this surprised me and I didnt realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up . ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion you used to be able to refer to them as the safer option to invest in but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products its even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks . When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage or 2x short Tesla its actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information . If people are willing to pay for products companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that ."

Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights, things that stood out to me: \\- Revenue grew 22% YoY to $1.23 billion, beating the $1.22 billion estimate \\- Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents, beating the 94 cent estimate \\- Added $265m of net new ARR in the quarter (+73% YoY) \\- ARR as of October 31st, 2025 was $4.92b (+23% YoY) \\- $398m in operating cash flow vs $326m last year \\- $296m in free cash flow vs $231m last year \\- Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and net new ARR. CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him. This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings, and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and don't know why they sold. Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically, and this time doesn't look any different to me. The fundamentals here are strong, this quarter lines up the next leg of growth, and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market. So at these levels, do you guys view $CRWD as a buy, hold, or sell? (I do personally own the stock).",

      "selftext": "What are your thoughts on ADBE before they report earnings on Dec 10? The company is down 37% over the last year and 25.9% YTD. They are currently trading at a PE of 20 (5 year average is 41), while the S&P is trading at a PE ratio of 30. The company is growing revenue by about 10% year over year vs the S&P at 5%. They also have very little debt, coming in at 4% vs the average of the S&P at 25%. They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter. They grew free cash flow by 52% over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares (25 billion through 2028 to be exact). Adobe’s profit margins are steady at 29% over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10% per year since 2022. They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at, and yet the price continues to fall. Am I missing something here? I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn’t like them, but the numbers don’t reflect that. I also hear that as much as the user base does not like their pricing, they have no other alternative but to use their products. Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels? If not, what price are you looking to start a position? Or why are you not starting a position?",

They are currently trading at a PE of 20 5 year average is 41 while the SP is trading at a PE ratio of 30 . The company is growing revenue by about 10 % year over year vs the SP at 5 % . They also have very little debt coming in at 4 % vs the average of the SP at 25 % . They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter . They grew free cash flow by 52 % over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares 25 billion through 2028 to be exact . Adobe ’ s profit margins are steady at 29 % over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10 % per year since 2022 . They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at and yet the price continues to fall . Am I missing something here I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn ’ t like them but the numbers don ’ t reflect that . I also hear that as much as the user base does not_like their pricing they have no_other alternative but to use their products . Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels If not_what price are you looking to start a position Or why are you not_starting a position"

      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about the fabled “AI Bubble” but I see a much different problem all together. Here’s what I see in phases. Just my DD. Phase 1: AI demand will keep exploding for years, like a river that keeps widening no matter how many dams you build. Look at the Micron news recently, or the Genesis Executive Order. The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave, even if the economy is doing crap (it is). Phase 2: Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can’t get entry level jobs. Right now, AI layoffs feel like cutting “cost fat,” but if they keep going, you’re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive. Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke? Who will buy a house when they can’t establish credit or a down payment? You see how this trickles? Phase 3: Structural unemployment doesn’t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries. I’m talking entry level positions in finance, HR, hospitality, etc, etc. Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entry-level coding, customer support, basic analysis, HR screening, or content production, companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans, so those roles don’t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay. Over time, this creates a gap: a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no longer exist, while new AI-era jobs (prompt engineers, system architects, AI ops, etc.) require skills, credentials, or geography that many of them don’t have. What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don’t have a career option in their major? *This is kind of a doomer post, so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong. I hope this country can thrive, but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming.",

Phase 1 AI demand will keep exploding for years like a river that keeps widening no_matter how many dams you build . Look at the Micron news recently or the Genesis Executive Order . The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave even if the economy is doing crap it is . Phase 2 Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can ’ t get entry level jobs . Right now AI layoffs feel like cutting “ cost fat ” but if they keep going you ’ re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive . Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke Who will buy a house when they can ’ t establish credit or a down payment You see how this trickles Phase 3 Structural unemployment doesn ’ t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries . I ’ m talking entry level positions in finance HR hospitality etc etc . Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entrylevel coding customer support basic analysis HR screening or content production companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans so those roles don ’ t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay . Over time this creates a gap a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no_longer exist while new AIera jobs prompt engineers system architects AI ops etc . require skills credentials or geography that many of them don ’ t have . What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don ’ t have a career option in their major This is kind of a doomer post so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong . I hope this country can thrive but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming ."

      "selftext": "CME FedWatch s latest data shows: The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in December has risen to 89%. The probability of maintaining rates unchanged is approximately 11%. By January next year, the cumulative probability of a 25 basis point rate cut stands at about 65%, while the probability of a 50 basis-point cut is approximately 28%. As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading, this shift is hard to ignore. My key considerations: If rate cuts materialize: Could drive gains in tech, high growth, and high beta sectors, potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side: Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a rate-cut environment, though rate-sensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution: If markets overprice “easing” expectations, a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives: With rising probability of rate cuts, would you preemptively position in growth stocks/tech sectors, or maintain defensive holdings/cash reserves? If trading options or high volatility assets, how would you manage potential market turbulence? Is this a trend driven opportunity or a short-term sentiment-fueled rally? Share your insights or strategies this is an opportunity to reassess positions, not blindly chase highs.",

      "selftext_processed": "CME FedWatch s latest data shows The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in December has risen to 89 % . The probability of maintaining rates unchanged is approximately 11 % . By January next year the cumulative probability of a 25 basis point rate cut stands at about 65 % while the probability of a 50 basispoint cut is approximately 28 % . As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading this shift is hard to ignore . My key considerations If rate cuts materialize Could drive gains in tech high growth and high beta sectors potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a ratecut environment though ratesensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution If markets overprice “ easing ” expectations a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives With rising probability of rate cuts would you preemptively position in growth stockstech sectors or maintain defensive holdingscash reserves If trading options or high volatility assets how would you manage potential market turbulence Is this a trend driven opportunity or a shortterm sentimentfueled rally Share your insights or strategies this is an opportunity to reassess positions not_blindly chase highs ."

      "selftext": "Thesis: High-quality business with durable competitive advantages trading at a reasonable price, now with improving capital allocation. Moat: Search dominance (90% share) and network effects. AI Infrastructure: Proprietary TPUs provide a cost/performance advantage over peers relying solely on Nvidia. Capital Return: Shift from cash hoarding to shareholder returns (buybacks + dividends). Valuation check: Trades at 27.1x P/E, which is a 27% discount to the peer group average of 37x. Durable advantage + reasonable price. Business Segments: Search: $56.6B revenue (Q3 '24), 14.5% YoY growth. 90% global market share remains stable despite AI threats. YouTube: $50B+ revenue (ads + subs). 2.53B reach. Dominant in streaming watch time. Cloud (GCP): $15.2B revenue (Q3 '25), 30% YoY growth, 24% operating margins. 90% of AI unicorns use GCP. Financial Health: Cash: $66.7B TTM Free Cash Flow (3.2% yield). Balance Sheet: Fortress balance sheet with $76.9B net cash and minimal debt (0.11 D/E ratio). Management (Sundar Pichai): Proven track record (Chrome, Android integration, GCP growth from 6% to 13% share). Successfully navigated AI pivot with Gemini deployment to 1B+ users. Multiples: Current P/E: 27.1x. • FCF Yield: \\~3.2%. Total Yield: \\~2.3% (2% buyback yield + 0.3% dividend yield). Capital Allocation: retiring 2-3% of shares annually; initiated first-ever dividend ($0.20/quarter). Low payout ratio (8.29%) leaves room for growth. Market Positioning: Not cheap, but valuation is attractive relative to the S&P 500 and tech peers. TPU Advantage: Vertically integrated chip stack allows for lower cost of compute for AI, protecting margins better than competitors renting Nvidia GPUs. Expert Views: Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO): Acknowledged the quality of Google's TPU program. Internal Sentiment: CEO Pichai maintains top 5% approval ratings among peer CEOs. Competitive Check: Gemini 3 Pro and Veo 3 killing it on benchmarks. Here's my workflow visualized: [ BUY / BULLISH Conclusion: Alphabet offers a rare combination of growth (Cloud/AI) and value (Search cash cow). The transition to custom silicon (TPUs) creates a defensible long-term infrastructure advantage, while the new capital return program sets a floor for investor returns. Risks regarding AI disruption in search are mitigated by their own AI integration and hardware advantages.",

Memory shortage could delay AI projects, productivity gains. SK Hynix predicts memory shortage to last through late 2027. Smartphone makers warn of price rises due to soaring memory costs. An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumer-electronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies, as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data. The squeeze spans almost every type of memory, from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that feeds AI chips in data centers. Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February, according to market-research firm TrendForce, drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run. The fallout could reach beyond tech. Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AI-based productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure. It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate US tariffs.

I know the fees are super high with Edward jones and I feel pretty terrible about basically dealing with that for a decade but it has to be better than not investing at all right?

      "selftext": "So I've been investing for years and honestly I thought I was doing pretty well, nothing crazy but decent returns, portfolio is growing, and I felt good about my strategy and everything. Then I started looking at what other people actually hold on blossom and man that was humbling as hell, like I'm sitting here proud of my 40% voo 30% individual stocks 30% cash thinking I'm being smart and diversified, meanwhile everyone else my age is way more aggressive and honestly crushing it because of it. For instance I saw one dude's portfolio that's like 80% growth stocks and he's up 45% this year while I'm at maybe 18%, which made me realize I'm probably being too conservative for someone with 35 years till retirement, but the weirdest part was seeing how many people just hold 3-5 positions total and do better than my diversified 25 stock portfolio, kinda makes you question if diversification is actually helping or just watering down returns tbh. Not saying I'm gonna copy what other people do but it def made me rethink my whole approach, like maybe I should take more risk while I'm young instead of investing like I'm already 50, idk… anyone else compares their portfolio to others and realizes you're way more conservative than you thought? Kinda a weird feeling…",

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not priced in. edit: this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards. Reverse reddit. Calls. As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started. Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1, 2, and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients. So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market. The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not going further down. So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point. Low risk of losing any significant amounts. The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies. before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma; the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit. lower side seems to be non-existent while the up side seems to be 10x. What am i missing here? Postion: 30k shares at 27.5 Average.",

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not_priced in . edit this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards . Reverse reddit . Calls . As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started . Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1 2 and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients . So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market . The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not_going further down . So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point . Low risk of losing any significant amounts . The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not_factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies . before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit . lower side seems to be nonexistent while the up side seems to be 10x . What am i missing here Postion 30k shares at 27.5 Average ."

      "selftext": "Have been doing business with a hard money lending investment partnership. Generally I have been collecting an average of 9.5% interest on each deal, with the deals being 12 months and backed up by 50% LTV real estate. Not crazy minimums, around 25K USD. All of my investments have performed and none defaulted, pretty solid underwriting and only on commercial stuff. Here is my question…I can borrow against my investment portfolio at a 4.97% rate, risk being it is variable and tied to fed rate. Is it a completely foolish idea to borrow against this, lend the money via the hard money lender, and make the difference on the spread of the two rates?",

      "selftext": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom, market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle (ORCL.US) might issue up to $100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions. Worries over Oracle's debt situation drove its five year credit default swap (CDS) to surge to a three year high. However, BNP Paribas believes Oracle's actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $100 billion. Therefore, Oracle may only need to issue $25 billion to $35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development. While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the company's recent $18 billion bond offering, it remains far below the $100 billion level that had investors concerned. It's worth noting that given Oracle's high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business, we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden. Management could also explore alternative financing solutions (such as vendor financing) to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures. Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “Overweight” rating, but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations, some have lowered their target price from $430 to $390. Furthermore, the market currently prices Oracle's collaboration with OpenAI at only a “minimal upside.” This can be calculated: approximately 84% of Oracle's current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses. Estimates suggest Oracle's cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027. This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets.",

According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed.

MSFT: Cloud and enterprise demand remain robust; while less flashy than other stocks, Microsoft's shares offer greater safety if the macroeconomy stumbles. 3. GOOGL: They continue to profit from advertising and cloud services, and their investments in AI appear promising. I'm not looking for potential winners, but rather which stocks might actually hold up through the end of the year or even continue to rise in December. I'd appreciate your valuable insights. Invest cautiously don't blindly follow trends!!!!!",

      "selftext": "The latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.

      "title": "Macy’s drops 7% pre-market on strongest growth in 3 years while raising outlook and warning on holiday spending and tariffs",
      "selftext": "No paywall: [ >Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum. >The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion. >Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace. >It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. >Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. >And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter. >Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday. >In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season. >“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. >He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury. >Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: >Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents >Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected >Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open. >Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. >The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. >In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents. >Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter. >In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%. >Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%. >Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs. >He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. >“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.” >The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. >For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors. >Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said. >Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs. >As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "No_paywall Macy ’ s on Wednesday beat Wall Street ’ s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company ’ s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum . The department store operator raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook after its betterthanexpected fiscal third quarter . The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2 and $ 2.20 up from its previous expectation of $ 1.70 to $ 2.05 and net sales of $ 21.48 billion to $ 21.63 billion compared with its prior outlook of $ 21.15 billion and $ 21.45 billion . Macy ’ s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5 % comparable sales growth from the previous year . That compares to its previous expectations for a yearoveryear decline of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % . The industry metric takes out onetime dynamics like store openings and closures and Macy ’ s includes merchandise that it owns items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its thirdparty online marketplace . It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy ’ s raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook . The company had cut its fullyear earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs more promotions and “ some moderation ” in discretionary spending . Even so the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the yearago net sales of $ 22.29 billion . Macy ’ s said about $ 700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year which ended Feb. 1 and in the early part of this fiscal year . And Macy ’ s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter . Shares dropped about 6 % in premarket trading on Wednesday . In an interview with CNBC CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “ prudent view ” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough yearoveryear comparisons and because it ’ s not_sure how “ aspirational customers ” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured may spend during the season . “ We ’ re pleased with the fourth quarter to date but we have a big holiday in front of us ” he said . He said Macy ’ s department store model is an advantage during the giftgiving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices from offprice to luxury . Here ’ s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue $ 4.71 billion vs. $ 4.62 billion expected Macy ’ s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales particularly for its namesake brand . Macy ’ s department stores account for the majority of the New York Citybased legacy retailer ’ s business but their performance has lagged behind the company ’ s higherend department store Bloomingdale ’ s and beauty chain Bluemercury . To try to reverse that trend the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing sharper merchandise and eyecatching displays at Macy ’ s stores . It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations which were dubbed the “ First 50 ” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy ’ s locations . That ’ s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy ’ s plans to keep open . Along with the added investment it has shuttered lowerperforming Macy ’ s locations . It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027 while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale ’ s and Bluemercury . The company hasn ’ t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year . In the threemonth period that ended Nov. 1 Macy ’ s net income fell to $ 11 million or 4 cents per share compared with $ 28 million or 10 cents per share in the yearago period . Adjusting for some onetime items including gains on the sale of real estate it reported earnings per share of 9 cents . Revenue decreased from $ 4.74 billion in the yearago quarter . In the fiscal third quarter companywide comparable sales rose 3.2 % including owned and licensed merchandise and its thirdparty marketplace . When the company excluded stores that won ’ t be part of its goforward business that growth was 3.4 % . Bloomingdale ’ s posted the strongest performance of the company ’ s brands with comparable sales jumping 9 % year over year on an ownedpluslicensed basis including its thirdparty marketplace . And Bluemercury ’ s comparable sales increased 1.1 % . Spring attributed the company ’ s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy ’ s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like highend home goods company MacKenzieChilds . He said he visited Macy ’ s stores and those of its competitors on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw . “ I like the way we ’ re showing up ” he said . “ We look crisp . We look clean . We look interesting compelling inspiring easy to shop. ” The snap to cooler weather helped too he said . As temperatures turned cooler in October shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters outerwear and boots . For the holiday season Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the yearago period at Macy ’ s stores and website along with those of its competitors . Higher tariffs however will mean higher prices for some items . Macy ’ s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected he said . Still Spring said Macy ’ s has made “ selective ” price increases in almost every category with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs . As of Tuesday ’ s close Macy ’ s shares have risen about 34 % so far this year . That outpaces the SP 500′s 16 % gains during the same period . Macy ’ s stock closed Tuesday at $ 22.71 bringing the company ’ s market cap to about $ 6.10 billion ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m curious to know what fees you pay with your broker and what the capital gains tax rate is in your country. Here in Italy, capital gains on stocks, bonds, and similar instruments are taxed at 26%, while gains on government bonds are taxed at 12.5%. I trade with Fineco Bank, and each order to buy stocks, bonds, etc. costs €19, plus another €19 to sell. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "* The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum, and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 4:49:11 PM EST. * BMNR price increased by 10.26% yesterday. * Today's Fusaka update marks Ethereum's second major network enhancement of 2025, following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th, which sparked a 29% rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations. * The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits, expanding transaction capacity per block (increasing TPS), and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling. This makes the network more secure, faster, more efficient, and with lower gas fees. A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets. It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure, \"bank-grade\" hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor. * This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further, with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster. * Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, with a near-term downside to $2,500. But the downside is minor compared to the upside. * Today, the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act, a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming near-term catalysts for BMNR after today's Fusaka upgrade: * A probable Fed rate cut (CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8% chance of a 25-bp cut) next Wednesday will increase liquidity. * The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17, 2025, with a bipartisan vote, and the bill has moved to the Senate. The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption, particularly among banks and the Fed. * Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system. Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNR's underlying largest asset. * Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026. * Achieving the Alchemy of 5% would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve. BMNR currently owns more than 3% of the total ETH. * Moonshots, which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network * Increasing Institutional Ownership",

      "selftext_processed": "The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 44911 PM EST . BMNR price increased by 10.26 % yesterday . Todays Fusaka update marks Ethereums second major network enhancement of 2025 following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th which sparked a 29 % rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations . The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits expanding transaction capacity per block increasing TPS and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling . This makes the network more secure faster more efficient and with lower gas fees . A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets . It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure bankgrade hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor . This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster . Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $ 7000 and $ 9000 by early 2026 with a nearterm downside to $ 2500 . But the downside is minor compared to the upside . Today the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter . BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming nearterm catalysts for BMNR after todays Fusaka upgrade A probable Fed rate cut CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8 % chance of a 25bp cut next Wednesday will increase liquidity . The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17 2025 with a bipartisan vote and the bill has moved to the Senate . The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption particularly among banks and the Fed . Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system . Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNRs underlying largest asset . Made in America Validator Network MAVAN for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026 . Achieving the Alchemy of 5 % would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve . BMNR currently owns more than 3 % of the total ETH . Moonshots which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network Increasing Institutional Ownership"

The rebound from Tuesday seems to be holding, even with mixed signals coming from manufacturing data, holiday spending, and the broader macro picture. The Fed narrative is shifting again: interviews for Powell’s potential successor were reportedly cancelled, which has strengthened expectations that Kevin Hassett who’s generally viewed as a rate-cut supporter could take over next year. That’s adding another layer to the rate-cut speculation already building. Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week’s meeting have climbed to 87%, up sharply from 63% a month ago. Today’s focus is on incoming data: ADP jobs report, expected to show very soft hiring (10k vs 42k prior). ISM services, especially the prices-paid and employment components. Industrial production also on the radar. With official government jobs data landing only after next week’s Fed decision, the market is relying more heavily on private reports than usual.",

The Fed narrative is shifting again interviews for Powell ’ s potential successor were reportedly cancelled which has strengthened expectations that Kevin Hassett who ’ s generally viewed as a ratecut supporter could take over next year . That ’ s adding another layer to the ratecut speculation already building . Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week ’ s meeting have climbed to 87 % up sharply from 63 % a month ago . Today ’ s focus is on incoming data ADP jobs report expected to show very soft hiring 10k vs 42k prior . ISM services especially the pricespaid and employment components . Industrial production also on the radar . With official government jobs data landing only after next week ’ s Fed decision the market is relying more heavily on private reports than usual ."

      "selftext": "10 months ago I posted a DD on Intel in here on why Intel is going to go big. Back then the price was at 22.5$ and I had 3k shares. Fast forward to 10 months later and I increased my position to 10.100 shares for an average of 23.5$ and now Intel is at 43.5$. This thing can and, if macro allows, will go a lot higher. We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future). Currently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months. In nana we trust.",

      "selftext": "Weekly mortgage data came in with a pretty mixed picture. The average 30-year fixed rate for conforming loans ($806,500 or below) ticked down to 6.32%, from 6.40% the week prior. Despite lower rates, refinance applications fell 4%, which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels. On the other hand, purchase applications rose 3%, suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets. Overall, rates drifting lower is good news, but the demand response is still pretty uneven. It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior.

The average 30year fixed rate for conforming loans $ 806500 or below ticked down to 6.32 % from 6.40 % the week prior . Despite lower rates refinance applications fell 4 % which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels . On the other hand purchase applications rose 3 % suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets . Overall rates drifting lower is good news but the demand response is still pretty uneven . It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior .

Yeah, their finances look terrible, yeah the sentiment towards them among online communities is bad BUT I see 2 things that are likely to happen. Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout, or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own (Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy, Rayman, Prince of Persia etc.) they could completely turn around their financial results. Now I'm not saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I don't think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think. I would like to hear why I'm stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into.",

Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own Assassins Creed Far Cry Tom Clancy Rayman Prince of Persia etc . they could completely turn around their financial results . Now Im not_saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I dont think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think . I would like to hear why Im stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, 22M here. I’m current sitting on $24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up. I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on, and want to start thinking a bit more long term. I previously thought of going 60% nasdaq and 40% all world, but at my age this seems a bit too boring. I want to be a bit more risky until age 25-30 before I start to get super safe with my investments. So I was thinking 100% Mag-7. Like I mentioned i’ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk, and this would be for long term holding. I would contribute around $600/month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction, then would go all in with the $24k (into Mag-7, and save about 20% for some high risk AI/Nuclear/Quantum plays). Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i’m not missing anything important, besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride. Thanks",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys 22M here . I ’ m current sitting on $ 24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up . I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on and want to start thinking a bit more long term . I previously thought of going 60 % nasdaq and 40 % all world but at my age this seems a bit too boring . I want to be a bit more risky until age 2530 before I start to get super safe with my investments . So I was thinking 100 % Mag7 . Like I mentioned i ’ ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk and this would be for long term holding . I would contribute around $ 600month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction then would go all in with the $ 24k into Mag7 and save about 20 % for some high risk AINuclearQuantum plays . Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i ’ m not_missing anything important besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Hello all! My parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&P-500-level returns with a little diversification. They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week. Here’s the rough allocation we’re considering: U.S. Large Cap (S&P-ish): SCHX – 40% Total U.S. Market: SCHB – 30% Developed International: SCHF – 10% Emerging Markets: SCHE – 5% U.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10% TIPS: SCHP – 5% All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab. Questions: 1. Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately? 2. Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)? 3. Would a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate? 4. Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY? Thanks in advance for any input.",

They just inherited $ 500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months . They don ’ t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility . Their goal is basically SP500level returns with a little diversification . They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “ should ” sign with him . We ’ re not_sure that ’ s necessary since they ’ re leaning toward a simple lowfee ETFbased plan and dollarcost averaging $ 5–10k per week . Here ’ s the rough allocation we ’ re considering U.S. Large Cap SPish SCHX – 40 % Total U.S. Market SCHB – 30 % Developed International SCHF – 10 % Emerging Markets SCHE – 5 % U.S. Bonds SCHZ – 10 % TIPS SCHP – 5 % All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab . Questions 1 . Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid60s who don ’ t need the money immediately 2 . Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup ETF vs mutual fund tax considerations rebalancing etc . 3 . Would a simpler onefund option like SWANXSWYNX be more appropriate 4 . Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary or is this straightforward enough to DIY Thanks in advance for any input ."

      "selftext": "Here's my situation. I've got about $900K in a non-IRA (Schwab) in an Irrevocable Trust (I'm the sole Beneficiary & Trustee if that matters - the Trust itself is complex, but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it). I want to get a line-of-credit loan of perhaps $150K, that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution (where I have about $700K) whenever I feel like it's time to ring the register on some position there. Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate). (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL) If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns. I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%). I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing. Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money. I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan. I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

Ive got about $ 900K in a nonIRA Schwab in an Irrevocable Trust Im the sole Beneficiary Trustee if that matters the Trust itself is complex but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it . I want to get a lineofcredit loan of perhaps $ 150K that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution where I have about $ 700K whenever I feel like its time to ring the register on some position there . Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now or soon will be longterm unrealized gains because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150 % of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver94 % plan I cant extract the gains indeed some of these gains are 6X so most of the proceeds would be gains and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare i.e . the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150 % would be equivalent to a 25 % implicit tax rate . I could retain the income in the Trust but that would be at a 23.8 % haircut 20 % longterm capgains 3.8 % ACA tax oh the irony LOL If it matters this $ 150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house for my personal residence use on a property that the Trust owns . I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab but the interest rate is ridiculous like 11 % . I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25 % but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there as well as them having notsogood_service although since I wouldnt be doing much I guess it wouldnt be a big thing . Any transfer would be to my Trust nonIRA actually checking account associated with the Trust nonIRA at Schwab which is the account that I would be using to spend the money . I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB and he got something like 6 % on a loan although this wasnt a Trust account and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan . I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower my own financial situation is irrelevant for the record my credit score is A but of course my official income is very low LOL ."

      "selftext": "Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest. Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. Still, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile. [Link to article](",

      "title": "Tesla x Michael Burry x Musk lies",
      "selftext": "You don't need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musk's LIES. Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla. Let’s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed. Feel free to verify each statement yourself :) Long story short, Burry said has an history of going all-in in whatever sounds cool, rarely following up on promises and that competition wins. Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 2020/2021. He then moved to full-self driving as its \"main goal\", but Google’s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4. Tesla? 20 cars that still need supervision (level 2+) but hear me out, he's gonna DOUBLE it to 40 by late December. Ready for the misleading headlines \"Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network\" ??? So after failing with this, he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots. Last year he promised by the end of this year he'd produce 5000 robots. Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that’s just what he dies. He got his Trillion dollar package, he's good. In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality... so, as Burry said, the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elon's total addressable market. Now, I personally don't trust a management who doesn't offer reliable projections. When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls, their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up. Just take note, for each company, of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters, set it on your calendar to check back on it and you’ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don’t have time to listen/read all of the guidance, copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto :) ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious, never overpromises and often overdelivers. That's a company you can trust. That's a company who's CEO words are worth something while Elon's at this point is just toilet paper. Guy is not a genius, he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is. This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world. Then he takes all the credit, as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is. You don't need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud, you just need to actually listen what he says and how he's just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says. He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved, the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and ego-driven adventures against OpenAI, , and whomever proved to be better than him at executing. To be complete, here's the list of unmet promises: - $25000 family car: promised in 2006. January 2025 he confirmed production would start, later scrapped the plan in April 2025. - Cheaper models announced late 2024: delayed to prioritize Cybertruck (which was a complete failure) - Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production. Delayed every year since then, new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered. - New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production, Delayed every year since then. - Unsupervised full self driving in Austin: promised by June 2025, still not achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size. - Large-scale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles: bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far. - Self-delivering teslas: promised by 2019, never realized. IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER I'm not saying you should sell. Just stay informed, read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock. You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk, knowing there's a history of missing deadlines, promises and flip-flop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail. The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true, but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon. Ignore people with aggressive ideas, they are just desperate Read the comments, you’ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts.

      "selftext_processed": "You dont need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musks LIES . Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla . Let ’ s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed . Feel free to verify each statement yourself Long story short Burry said has an history of going allin in whatever sounds cool rarely following up on promises and that competition wins . Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 20202021 . He then moved to fullself driving as its main goal but Google ’ s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4 . Tesla 20 cars that still need supervision level 2 but hear me out hes gon na DOUBLE it to 40 by late December . Ready for the misleading headlines Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network So after failing with this he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots . Last year he promised by the end of this year hed produce 5000 robots . Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that ’ s just what he dies . He got his Trillion dollar package hes good . In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality ... so as Burry said the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elons total addressable market . Now I personally dont trust a management who doesnt offer reliable projections . When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up . Just take note for each company of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters set it on your calendar to check back on it and you ’ ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don ’ t have time to listenread all of the guidance copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious never_overpromises and often overdelivers . Thats a company you can trust . Thats a company whos CEO words are worth something while Elons at this point is just toilet paper . Guy is not_a genius he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is . This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world . Then he takes all the credit as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is . You dont need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud you just need to actually listen what he says and how hes just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says . He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and egodriven adventures against OpenAI and whomever proved to be better than him at executing . To be complete heres the list of unmet promises $ 25000 family car promised in 2006 . January 2025 he confirmed production would start later scrapped the plan in April 2025 . Cheaper models announced late 2024 delayed to prioritize Cybertruck which was a complete failure Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production . Delayed every year since then new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered . New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production Delayed every year since then . Unsupervised full self driving in Austin promised by June 2025 still not_achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size . Largescale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far . Selfdelivering teslas promised by 2019 never_realized . IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER Im not_saying you should sell . Just stay informed read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock . You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk knowing theres a history of missing deadlines promises and flipflop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail . The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon . Ignore people with aggressive ideas they are just desperate Read the comments you ’ ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts . Stay safe stay invested Credits to Ettore Mihaili from Netherlands"

      "selftext": "Anthropic has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to begin work on one of the largest initial public offerings ever, which could come as soon as 2026, as the artificial intelligence start-up races OpenAI to the public market. The maker of the Claude chatbot, which is in talks for a private funding round that would value it at more than $300bn, chose the US west coast law firm in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, had also discussed a potential IPO with big investment banks, according to multiple people with knowledge of those talks. The people characterised the discussions as preliminary and informal, suggesting that the company was not close to picking its IPO underwriters. Nonetheless, these moves represent a significant step up in Anthropic’s preparations for an IPO that would test the appetite of public markets to back the massive, lossmaking research labs at the heart of the AI boom. Wilson Sonsini has advised Anthropic since 2022, including on multibillion-dollar investments from Amazon, and has worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft. Its investors are enthusiastic about an IPO, arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first. Sources: FINANCIAL TIMES/ Reuter",

      "selftext": "While commercial property may go vacant somewhere, its rising in profit elseware. Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease. In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years. But unlike a shop in a mall, such as dillards or sears - simon is much less exposed than people think. The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use - the mall near me for example, houses a city police unit and a church. Im not looking at this from a consumer perspective - instead seeing it as an investment in best-in-class commercial real estate and adaptable management. The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary - as value was lost over speculative concern regarding e-commerce and terrifs. Which as seen in the earnings report, was almost a non factor. The stock fell due to irrelevant fud, and is due to make returns to its original trend line. 220-250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term, and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory, its already a proven success.. Cliff: SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no direct stake in the success of retail - its an asset management company, not a clothing store.",

Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease . In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years . But unlike a shop in a mall such as dillards or sears simon is much less exposed than people think . The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not_in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use the mall near me for example houses a city police unit and a church . Im not_looking at this from a consumer perspective instead seeing it as an investment in bestinclass commercial real estate and adaptable management . The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary as value was lost over speculative concern regarding ecommerce and terrifs . Which as seen in the earnings report was almost a non factor . The stock fell due to irrelevant fud and is due to make returns to its original trend line . 220250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory its already a proven success .. Cliff SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no_direct stake in the success of retail its an asset management company not_a clothing store ."

In this inflationary speculative environment AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, are all given premium valuations with 40-120x pe and can still be considered fair value. TSMC is sitting at a \"healthy\" tech sector pe of anywhere around 28-30 day to day.

Their revenues, margins, growth is exemplary and honestly criminally undervalued in such a inflationary AI environment. Are there any other reasons besides hostilities from China why TSMC hasnt gone side by side with Nvidia in growth? I'm No analyst and really am your every day idiot retail investor who absolutely fucking loves to by high sell low.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%. A little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up. But, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? Thank you!",

But I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later . I ’ m wondering if it ’ s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns or if there are other factors I should consider . Maybe it is best to do some of both Thank you"

Hold to maturity: Income is state/local tax free. Sell the bond for a profit on the secondary market: Income is effectively a short term capital gain where both state/local and federal taxes apply. So in California where my state taxes are ~10%, I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10% lower than the secondary market price. Is my understanding correct here?",

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank. “We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting. Last week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting. “I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.” Trump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas. The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.” However, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell. For months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively. Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years. In September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer. The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank . “ We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year ” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting . Last week sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesdays cabinet meeting . “ I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too ” Trump said . “ I dont know who qualifies for the word ‘ potential. ’ I can tell you hes a respected individual . Thank you Kevin. ” Trumps remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement . Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold who has overseen the selection process previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas . The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik he had considered about 10 candidates for the position but now “ weve narrowed it down to one person. ” However it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions meaning the nomination can not be considered final until formally announced . Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh and BlackRocks Rick Riddell . For months Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells term expires in May and appointing his successor will be Trumps biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed . Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively . Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday calling him a “ stubborn guy who probably doesnt like your president. ” Although Powells term as chairman ends next year he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years . In September Trump explicitly named Hassett Wash and Waller as his top three candidates . Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer . The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank . However Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters . Additionally the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trumps attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook . Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation . If the nominee is an outsider they are likely to receive a 14year term as a Fed governor beginning February 1 ."

      "selftext": "The Verge, Dec 2, 2025 Google’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off. The tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in. In the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said. There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development. The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.

      "selftext_processed": "The Verge Dec 2 2025 Google ’ s own ‘ code red ’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off . The tides are turning in the AI race and the pressure is getting to OpenAI . Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “ code red ” on Monday urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT an indicator that the startup ’ s onceunassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in . In the memo reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads shopping and health agents and a personal assistant Pulse to focus on improving ChatGPT . This includes core features like greater speed and reliability better personalization and the ability to answer more questions he said . There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot the memo said and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development . The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability . It is also something of a fullcircle moment in the AI race . Google which declared its own “ code red ” after the arrival of ChatGPT is a particular concern . Google ’ s AI user base is growing helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model and its latest AI model Gemini 3 blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics .

I am trying to cash it out in his name (he has medical problems, and still alive), and the bank said that it needs to be digitized; no problem. I got the forms to get it digitized from Computershare, however I still have questions. According to computershare I have to send it to them in the states (the actual certificate), and I think make an account for him-which I did (the people were not helpful at all). I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form: a letter of authorization to transfer security to non-register account.

      "selftext": "I've read the books about investments like \"The Simple Path to Wealth\" and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people, performance, reputation, sales. Or rather *MADE* sense, back those days when not your every neighbor was an \"investor\" with a collection of stocks on their apps. And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not so well. Now coming to our days: people just invest monthly into MAG7/S&P500/etc doesn't matter are they doing good or bad(just look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation). Americans do their 401k, Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks. This is a huge and constant inflow of money. That is *NOT* based on any analysis, but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this, trying to escape inflation losses and get rich. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x. This is an enormous inflation. It's common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi. Now could you shed a light, how stock markets are different in a broad sense, if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier? **EDIT** Thanks to everyone for the answers, maybe I should've worded it clearer that my misconception/assumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index (like the S&P 500), they aren't looking at the individual stock's value. The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis, making it seem like a closed loop - a \"Ponzi scheme\" where the only buyers are the index funds themselves. u/[stuporman86]( and others brought great points here, that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here: \\- funds vs direct holdings: even though passive funds recently exceeded 50% of the money held in investment funds, funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment. The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings. This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching, selecting, and trading individual stocks and it' is crucial for setting prices based on value, not just automated buying. \\- economic studies suggest that a \"slim minority\" of informed, active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive read the books about investments like The Simple Path to Wealth and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people performance reputation sales . Or rather MADE sense back those days when not_your every neighbor was an investor with a collection of stocks on their apps . And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not_so well . Now coming to our days people just invest monthly into MAG7SP500etc doesnt matter are they doing good or badjust look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation . Americans do their 401k Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks . This is a huge and constant inflow of money . That is NOT based on any analysis but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this trying to escape inflation losses and get rich . Pricetoearnings PE ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x . This is an enormous inflation . Its common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi . Now could you shed a light how stock markets are different in a broad sense if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier EDIT Thanks to everyone for the answers maybe I shouldve worded it clearer that my misconceptionassumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index like the SP 500 they arent looking at the individual stocks value . The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis making it seem like a closed loop a Ponzi scheme where the only buyers are the index funds themselves . ustuporman86 and others brought great points here that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here funds vs direct holdings even though passive funds recently exceeded 50 % of the money held in investment funds funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment . The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings . This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching selecting and trading individual stocks and it is crucial for setting prices based on value not_just automated buying . economic studies suggest that a slim minority of informed active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery"

      "title": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout",
      "selftext": "Disclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows: Since inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues: -Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators. -Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders. -Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better. -Ad stack worst-in-class. -Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure. -Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power. -Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe. SNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below: -Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense. -Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers. -They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue. -They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide. SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive. What investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout. Regarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come. As for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results. In conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclosure long 250000 shares at $ 7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike postQ3 earnings making about $ 200k . However I now look at SNAP as more of a longerterm investment and my thesis follows Since inception SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can ’ t make money which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do . It faces the following issues Founders control the voting rights and haven ’ t been the best capital allocators . Egregious stockbased comp has diluted shareholders . Best features like Stories copied by META and monetized much better . Ad stack worstinclass . Very high operating costs mainly due to infrastructure . Young users hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power . Growing fast mainly in lowincome countries like Indian and Pakistan yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe . SNAP as Spiegel mentioned recently is at a crossroads . It can die a slow unprofitable death or it can innovate and start to make money for once . It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now and I will mention why below Started offering various subscriptions including Snapchat Memories Storage Lens and Platinum . Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $ 750 million year for now and is growing double digits which is unique among its peers . I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center such as Icloud storage Google etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there . The download and import process isn ’ t that easy and there will be friction . A certain number of users will say “ screw it I ’ ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it ” . Meanwhile the users that do not_pay for it will be limited in storage thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense . Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement . After all what use is having hordes of users if you can not make money off of them Sometimes you indeed have to “ fire ” your customers . They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature as well as Sponsored Snaps with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages . The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not_vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue . They recently reorganized into small nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy . The Snapchat success was created by a small team for example so they decided to scale this operationally companywide . SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “ thing ” I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology . They have the most used AR products in the world and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year . Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves which is also a positive as I don ’ t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account . Personally I do not_feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success mainly because SNAP has no_record of being successful in hardware . I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well . If they bomb then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward which would also be a positive . What investors need to think about is this How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU SNAP has that yet only has a $ 13 billion market cap . Ideally the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials . Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs a better ads platform and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically . However I ’ m not_playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares and a takeover won ’ t happen unless they want it to happen . More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout . Regarding stockbased comp dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped and while it is still relatively high management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked . They recently announced a $ 500 million buyback and I think we will see more to come . As for the recent $ 400 million Perplexity deal I see it as a oneoff and don ’ t ascribe much value to it for now especially since Evan said they won ’ t sell advertising against the chatbot results . In conclusion I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year . I don ’ t have a target price on the stock per se but it could become a $ 100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should ."

      "selftext": "Honestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking. It’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down. And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice? Idk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “ confidence ” “ sentiment ” “ vibes ” whatever you wan na call it . Earnings matter yeah interest rates matter yeah but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it ’ s worth buying . People hold because they trust it ’ ll go back up . People panic because they think someone else is panicking . It ’ s like one giant circular trust fall . Everyone is basically agreeing not_to look down . And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense Like not_a normal recession or correction but a day where enough people say “ nah I ’ m done trusting this casino. ” Would everything just… unwind Would indexes tank for years Would governments step in and force something Or does the system somehow survive because it ’ s too big to fail like people will keep believing simply because they have no_choice Idk maybe I ’ m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is . Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating"

I have a post-tax account and a pre-tax Traditional IRA. The post-tax account is mainly comprised of ETF's while the pre-tax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks. I want to move the money to something like FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index) with maybe a little bit of FSPSX (Fidelity International Index) for international exposure, and maybe just a touch of FTBFX (Fidelity Total Bond) for balancing purposes - although probably unnecessary right now. Set, forget, and make auto-contributions monthly. Never look at it. This is long term, I am very confident I won't need the money for 20+ years. 1. For the post-tax account, is the easiest (and/or only) way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETF's, withdraw the cash to my bank account, and then re-buy the Index Funds under my self-managed account? I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season. 2. For the Traditional IRA I obviously cannot withdraw the cash, so how would this one work? Thanks.",

I have a posttax account and a pretax Traditional IRA . The posttax account is mainly comprised of ETFs while the pretax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks . I want to move the money to something like FSKAX Fidelity Total Market Index with maybe a little bit of FSPSX Fidelity International Index for international exposure and maybe just a touch of FTBFX Fidelity Total Bond for balancing purposes although probably unnecessary right now . Set forget and make autocontributions monthly . Never_look at it . This is long term I am very confident I wont need the money for 20 years . 1 . For the posttax account is the easiest andor only way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETFs withdraw the cash to my bank account and then rebuy the Index Funds under my selfmanaged account I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season . 2 . For the Traditional IRA I obviously can not withdraw the cash so how would this one work Thanks ."

Meanwhile, the rumor mill is heating up: Google’s custom AI chips (TPUs / in-house silicon) might start hitting the broader AI-infrastructure market soon. If Google (or any big tech) begins selling in volume, we could see chip oversupply + falling prices + fierce competition the perfect storm for a big player with dead inventory. That means all those unsold GPUs and AI chips on NVIDIA’s balance sheet could turn into a serious liability leading not just to a stock dip, but possibly a collapse in GPU-driven AI dominance. Would love to hear from folks here: **Do you think this is just panic or a legitimate risk for NVIDIA? If you were building an AI/data-center stack now would you bet on GPUs or wait for custom silicon from Google/others?**",

      "title": "Leveraging my Roth IRA through Lifecycle Investing | Q4 2025",
      "selftext": "# Today, December 2nd, 2025 Hello again, it's the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the S&P500 is going to be positive for the year. I now have $18,421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $10,000 into it via the mega-backdoor method. I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $10,000 extra being converted in, but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback. Before the rebalance, accounting for the $10,000 coming in, my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions, which is basically no leverage. After rebalancing, my leverage sat near 2.2x. Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down. For this quarter I'm actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being. The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73% per Aswath Damodaran from NYU. Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below, it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below <4%. The authors did not explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4%, but it is pretty implied. How this impacts my performance in the long term is not known as this was not evaluated by the authors at the time of the book's publication. Unfortunately, this de-leverage change is occurring after a pullback, which can hurt my short-term performance, but in the long run it should all equal out (hopefully). Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information, not driven by fear or greed, suggests otherwise. Background * Currently 28 years old Reasons: 1. Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage. 2. The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0% invested into stocks by saying that in today's times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium (which I believe sits around 5% depending on which source you use) to determine whether to de-leverage. 1. In general, when the equity risk premium is <3% this indicates bonds may be a better investment, 4-6% suggests a 60/40 or a 70/30 stock to bond allocation, and >6% suggests potentially having a 100% stock portfolio. You will generally only see >6% during market downturns or recessions. 3. I am 28 years old. At this age per the book, I should still maintain my 2x leverage, however given the equity risk premium of <4%, I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being. Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy. Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise. That's all for this quarter, see you in March. \\--- Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months). [ Performance: Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64 Current investment: $18,421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far: Processing $10,161 Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement. **What Is Lifecycle Investing?** Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk. How to do this: * First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share. * Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs * Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real estate and cash as retirement nears. * Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter. Essentially, you're looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x **My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation** 06/2025: With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also, you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). **Plan** * Quarterly Recalculation: * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share. * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s. 1. De-leverage Schedule: * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage. * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase. * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation. * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches. **Risk Management and Contingencies** * Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage. * Market extremes: ~~If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.~~ * Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors. * Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal. **Summary** I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28-year-old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years. **Extensive Summary** I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Today December 2nd 2025 Hello again its the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the SP500 is going to be positive for the year . I now have $ 18421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $ 10000 into it via the megabackdoor method . I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $ 10000 extra being converted in but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback . Before the rebalance accounting for the $ 10000 coming in my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions which is basically no_leverage . After rebalancing my leverage sat near 2.2x . Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down . For this quarter Im actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being . The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73 % per Aswath Damodaran from NYU . Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below 4 % . The authors did not_explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4 % but it is pretty implied . How this impacts my performance in the long term is not_known as this was not_evaluated by the authors at the time of the books publication . Unfortunately this deleverage change is occurring after a pullback which can hurt my shortterm performance but in the long run it should all equal out hopefully . Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information not_driven by fear or greed suggests otherwise . Background Currently 28 years old Reasons 1 . Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage . 2 . The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0 % invested into stocks by saying that in todays times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium which I believe sits around 5 % depending on which source you use to determine whether to deleverage . 1 . In general when the equity risk premium is 3 % this indicates bonds may be a better investment 46 % suggests a 6040 or a 7030 stock to bond allocation and 6 % suggests potentially having a 100 % stock portfolio . You will generally only see 6 % during market downturns or recessions . 3 . I am 28 years old . At this age per the book I should still maintain my 2x leverage however given the equity risk premium of 4 % I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being . Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy . Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise . Thats all for this quarter see you in March . Please see below for the current information regarding the trade . Which I will be updating every quarter every 3 months . Performance Initial investment June 2025 $ 15611.64 Current investment $ 18421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far Processing $ 10161 Below I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement . What Is Lifecycle Investing Lifecycle investing by Ayres and Nalebuff argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth including future earnings is much larger than their current savings . Since most young investors have little capital available for investment but decades of future earnings they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans . As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal you should gradually reduce risk . How to do this First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share . Use leverage through either margin leveraged ETFs or deepinthemoney LEAPs Reduce leverage over time shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bondsreal estate and cash as retirement nears . Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter . Essentially youre looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation 062025 With only $ 15000 in my Roth IRA I can ’ t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in 2 years at the 300 strike price . So instead I ’ ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150 . VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase . Unfortunately VTI doesn ’ t offer options that expire 2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close . Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50 % of the underlying cost roughly 50 % of the ETF ’ s trading price mirroring 2x leverage . Ideally when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro Emini futures then Eminis as from an cost standpoint they actually cost the least as outlined in the book . Also you get the additional benefit of them not_expiring at least in the same way options do . Plan Quarterly Recalculation Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share . Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s . 1 . Deleverage Schedule Ages 27–30 Maintain 2x leverage . Ages 30–40 Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase . Ages 4050 Transition to a 1x unleveraged total equity allocation . Ages 50–59.5 Begin incorporating bondsreal estate and cash shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches . Risk Management and Contingencies Time decay I ’ ll monitor the LEAP ’ s theta and if rollover costs or time decay become excessive consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage . Market extremes If the cyclically adjusted PE CAPE ratio spikes above historical thresholds I may temporarily deleverage to 1x1.5x rather than fully exit equities . Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time . I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence . Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors . Rebalancing frequency I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal . Summary I ’ m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28yearold . Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments . Over the next decade I ’ ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears . Theoretically speaking over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years . Extensive Summary I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free"

      "selftext": "Hi all, As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions. I currently make ~ 95k and live at home with parents, I don’t pay rent, but I do pay $1000/ month towards my car payment (took a loan from family, will be fully paid off in 8 months, after which I’ll have no “expenses” per se) Now regarding my investment journey, I’ll start of by saying all the research I’ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA, so I’ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO. I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago, contributing 10% with a 5% employer match. Now the above retirement savings which I won’t be able to touch until I’m older, but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well? Is that even possible without risk? I am willing to invest $1000 monthly, is it best to just invest all of it in ETF’s? Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF’s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I’m doing with my Roth IRA. I don’t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $800 towards an ETF and $200 towards company stocks be a smart move? Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account, my understanding is that the benefits of this are: no limit on how much you can invest yearly, and withdraw your contributions anytime tax /penalty free, is my understanding of this correct? Thank you for any answers and advice!",

Once more Rivians hit the road this becomes high margin oxygen. Also VW plans to put sw in ice cars not just ev’s • EV credits didn’t go Rivian’s way, but the real win is that most hobbyist EV makers are basically dead now. Less noise in the EV market helps Rivian a lot. • RJ’s package deal finally shows adult supervision. Pay tied to performance, no stupid golden parachute, and strong alignment with long term shareholders. The Street actually likes that. • Amazon vans still matter. Even slower volume keeps production lines alive and predictable. • Costs coming down. They’re not lighting money on fire like before. Manufacturing efficiency is getting real. • Brand is strong as hell. R1 owners hype the product nonstop which is basically free marketing. I am going full regard",

Once more Rivians hit the road this becomes high margin oxygen . Also VW plans to put sw in ice cars not_just ev ’ s • EV credits didn ’ t go Rivian ’ s way but the real win is that most hobbyist EV makers are basically dead now . Less noise in the EV market helps Rivian a lot . • RJ ’ s package deal finally shows adult supervision . Pay tied to performance no_stupid golden parachute and strong alignment with long term shareholders . The Street actually likes that . • Amazon vans still matter . Even slower volume keeps production lines alive and predictable . • Costs coming down . They ’ re not_lighting money on fire like before .

      "title": "SEZL DD pt.2: BNPL, the most misunderstood industry",
      "selftext": "[My original DD for SEZL is here]( Previous post if you haven't seen it yet \\^, little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL: **BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now. It's not nearly as irresponsible or \"set to blow up\" as the general sentiment makes it out to be.** 1. Standard loan tenor of Sezzle's BNPL average 40-50 days, with AOVs being $100-250. 2. BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx. 2% versus Credit Cards at 10%. People use Sezzle for groceries, gas, and other essentials/semi-essentials. Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs. 3. Sezzle does NOT make money off of defaulting consumers! The long-term value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time. They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition - again, short-term pain for long term customer filtering. 4. Limits and product usage can be changed instantly, versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice. Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time. 5. CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzle's target base is already low-mid income; consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance. **6. Management from Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, Zip (BNPL providers) all noted no negative changes in repayment ability - Affirm CEO actually noted that govt. workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise.** 7. Points 1-6 point to the low-risk of these loans compared to CCs, Auto, Mortgages etc. due to the nature of their AOV + importance to the consumer. 8. The misconception that \"people will stop paying their BNPL loans first\". ZERO data to suggest this. Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario, along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs. People would much rather pay off the $100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever. 9. Sezzle offers optional credit-reporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour, along with their tier program. **What has overshadowed the share price as of late?** 1. Liquidity risk-off from high-beta stocks in recent weeks (late Oct-now) 2. Rising delinquency rates that were guided for, in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment & shaky macro news. Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2% to 3% in recent quarter, BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.5-2.75%, from original guide of 2.5-3%. 3. Compressed net margin from 28% Q2 to 23% Q3 - mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates, again, were guided for at start of the year. Should not be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product (subscriptions versus one-time use card). Expecting 25-27.5% stable net margin for 2026. There is SOME real concern here but not scary enough to lose conviction IMO. **Why I believe upside is 100% from here (6m+ hold)** 1. Re-shift to subscription mid Q3 netted +80,000 active subscribers. Assume minimum 120,000/Q add for the next 3-4 quarters: this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR, as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins. Their previous focus in Q1-3 was a lower margin, less sticky product which proved to not be as beneficial, hence the switch. Will be a $15M+ figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q1-2026. 1.5. Active consumers expected to grow @ 4-6% QoQ & payback period of 6-9 months on marketing spend (8M/quarter) will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters & beyond. 2. Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant \"fear\" classification. The fears are not completely unwarranted, but for the most part, blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space. This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour. 3. Continued penetration of consumer acquisition + general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users, and consequently revenue. 4. Trading at 14 NTM P/E growing at 60% YoY revenue & Net Income. History of earnings double beat. 5. Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged - management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentiment/repayment ability is low. Anticipating this to be closer to 4.5-5. 6. As bad as it may sound, their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials - cutting this service out of the user's life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it. End of the day, no different from a Credit Card. 7. Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners. *Conclusion: QE begins, market sentiment changes to \"BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears\", company performance will continue to deliver, and multiple expansion will persist to re-rate the company closer to 20-25x NTM P/E.* BASE case: assuming 20-25x NTM P/E: EPS 5.5 NTM @ May 2026: SP of $110-137.50. BULL case (short/gamma squeeze, unlikely, but happened May 2025): 35-40x NTM P/E, $200+ possible. UNLIKELY by EOY2026. **Positions have rotated into 800 shares. Options IV is way too high @ 90%.**",

      "selftext_processed": "My original DD for SEZL is here Previous post if you havent seen it yet little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now . Its not_nearly as irresponsible or set to blow up as the general sentiment makes it out to be . 1 . Standard loan tenor of Sezzles BNPL average 4050 days with AOVs being $ 100250 . 2 . BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx . 2 % versus Credit Cards at 10 % . People use Sezzle for groceries gas and other essentialssemiessentials . Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs . 3 . Sezzle does NOT_make money off of defaulting consumers The longterm value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time . They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition again shortterm pain for long term customer filtering . 4 . Limits and product usage can be changed instantly versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice . Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time . 5 . CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzles target base is already lowmid income consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance . 6 . Management from Affirm Klarna Sezzle Zip BNPL providers all noted no_negative changes in repayment ability Affirm CEO actually noted that govt . workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise . 7 . Points 16 point to the lowrisk of these loans compared to CCs Auto Mortgages etc . due to the nature of their AOV importance to the consumer . 8 . The misconception that people will stop paying their BNPL loans first . ZERO data to suggest this . Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs . People would much rather pay off the $ 100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever . 9 . Sezzle offers optional creditreporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour along with their tier program . What has overshadowed the share price as of late 1 . Liquidity riskoff from highbeta stocks in recent weeks late Octnow 2 . Rising delinquency rates that were guided for in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment shaky macro news . Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2 % to 3 % in recent quarter BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.52.75 % from original guide of 2.53 % . 3 . Compressed net margin from 28 % Q2 to 23 % Q3 mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates again were guided for at start of the year . Should not_be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product subscriptions versus onetime use card . Expecting 2527.5 % stable net margin for 2026 . There is SOME real concern here but not_scary enough to lose conviction IMO . Why I believe upside is 100 % from here 6m hold 1 . Reshift to subscription mid Q3 netted 80000 active subscribers . Assume minimum 120000Q add for the next 34 quarters this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins . Their previous focus in Q13 was a lower margin less sticky product which proved to not_be as beneficial hence the switch . Will be a $ 15M figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q12026 . 1.5 . Active consumers expected to grow 46 % QoQ payback period of 69 months on marketing spend 8Mquarter will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters beyond . 2 . Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant fear classification . The fears are not_completely unwarranted but for the most part blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space . This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour . 3 . Continued penetration of consumer acquisition general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users and consequently revenue . 4 . Trading at 14 NTM PE growing at 60 % YoY revenue Net Income . History of earnings double beat . 5 . Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentimentrepayment ability is low . Anticipating this to be closer to 4.55 . 6 . As bad as it may sound their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials cutting this service out of the users life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it . End of the day no_different from a Credit Card . 7 . Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners . Conclusion QE begins market sentiment changes to BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears company performance will continue to deliver and multiple expansion will persist to rerate the company closer to 2025x NTM PE . BASE case assuming 2025x NTM PE EPS 5.5 NTM May 2026 SP of $ 110137.50 . BULL case shortgamma squeeze unlikely but happened May 2025 3540x NTM PE $ 200 possible . UNLIKELY by EOY2026 . Positions have rotated into 800 shares . Options IV is way too high 90 % ."

Summary: \\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin. \\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio.

This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this? 2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?* \\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017. *3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?* \\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

In 6 months the account grew another $ 470K so Im at $ 1.5M of total gains since my first post 5 and a half years ago I did withdraw $ 250K to buy a new home so the account sits at $ 2.3M . Ending Net Deposits $ 1.5M in gains Thats a 27 % compound return a year for nearly 6 years . I continue to crush regular rstock boomer index fund portfolios I blue am 26337 while stocks green are barely 10037 over that time period The account has $ 7.3M assets and $ 5M borrowed in options so thats 3.2x leverage . Im underleveraged I know . The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $ 2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage . I havent decided . Summary Borrow 24x the value of your account on margin . Dump it all in a multiasset diversified portfolio . For the stock sleeve I prefer smartbeta funds due to their higher expected returns . The goal is maximum compound returns . Positions Stocks bonds mutual funds and $ 5M borrowed in Box Spread Options QA 1 When will you deleverpayoff the debtliquidate Never_This maximizes returns . Why do anything but this 2 Whats it like for your account to grow $ 1M per year Its cool you should try it . Save what you can invest it like this and give it time . I started with just $ 20K in 2017 . 3 Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere I have every penny riding in here . Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27 % per year so why do that"

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "selftext": "“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders. Burry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market. He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution. Burry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards. Tesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

      "selftext_processed": "“ Big Short ” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter calling the electricvehicle maker “ ridiculously overvalued ” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern . Burry argued that Tesla ’ s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no_buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders . Burry cited Tesla ’ s SEC filings showing that the company ’ s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7 % over the past several years driven primarily by stockbased compensation and past equity raises . Tesla ’ s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a splitadjusted basis following the company ’ s 5for1 stock split in 2020 and 3for1 split in 2022 both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market . He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period including two $ 5 billion atthemarket ATM raises in September and December 2020 followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $ 12 billion in new equity issuance . These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company ’ s float and remain a key driver of longterm dilution . Burry also referenced Tesla ’ s most recent quarterly filings which reported over $ 1.7 billion in stockbased compensation SBC expense yeartodate resulting in a continual increase in the weightedaverage share count used for earnings calculations . Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure including multiyear performancebased awards . Tesla has no_active sharebuyback program and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained freecashflow levels . Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equitylinked programs ."

      "selftext": "🚨🚨 BARRICK MINING (GOLD CHAD OF THE CENTURY) DD 🚨🚨 aka: Why $GOLD is about to melt faces harder than a 1999 dot-com chart but with ACTUAL PROFITS Listen up you smooth-brained degenerates who think “diversification” means buying calls AND puts on the same ticker. I bring you THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The One True DD. The post that will make your future grandchildren ask, “Grandpa, how did you become disgustingly wealthy?” And you’ll just whisper… “Barrick, my child.” ⸻ 💰 THE SETUP: BARRICK IS PRIMED TO GO GOD MODE Here’s what’s cooking hotter than Mali during the wet season: 1️⃣ S&P500 Inclusion → +$10 share price Index funds will have to buy this like a boomer panic-buying toilet paper in 2020. Guaranteed forced buying = tendies. 2️⃣ Analyst Price Targets Averaging $46 Wall Street FINALLY woke up from their coke-coma and realized Barrick isn’t some penny stock miner digging with spoons. 3️⃣ FOURMILE MINE = THE NEVADA GIGACHAD • Literally the #1 best mine discovery of our generation • Doesn’t require double fraction processing like the other peasant mines • Single fraction extraction = lower cost = higher profit = more stonk go up This thing prints gold like a stimmy printer in 2020. 4️⃣ Mali Resolution → +$10 share price No more geopolitical headache. Add another $10 because peace = profits. 5️⃣ Production Increasing 6% Every Year Imagine a miner that actually grows instead of declining like your OTM calls. Wild. ⸻ 🪙 THE GOLD MATH (YES, I DID MATH. YOU’RE WELCOME.) At different gold prices, Barrick is basically a cheat code: • $55 share price @ $3300 gold • $65 @ $3700 • Bank of America says $4000 gold by end of 2025 • $75 @ $4000 • $85 @ $4300 • $95 @ $4600 • $110 @ $5000 Gold going up? Barrick prints money. Gold going sideways? Barrick prints money. Gold going down? Barrick STILL prints money because Fourmile is basically a money-spitting dragon. ⸻ 📈 NOW THE JUICY PART Starting valuation: $55/share at $4000 gold Every +100 in gold price = +$3.5/share Current gold price in your note? $4200 gold. That means: • $55 base • +$10 from Mali • +$7 from the gold price difference 🔥 = $72/share conservative value right now 🔥 Market currently pricing Barrick like it’s a grandma with a metal detector, not a global gold emperor with the best mine in Nevada. ⸻ 🚀 TL;DR FOR THE ADHD AUTISTS • S&P inclusion = forced buying • Fourmile mine = god-tier print factory • Mali drama resolved • Analysts already behind the curve • Gold trending up • Barrick undervalued harder than Bitcoin at $200 Target: $72 short-term. $110+ if gold hits $5k. ⸻ 🦍💎 FINAL THOUGHTS 💎🦍 This isn’t a meme stock. This is the anti-meme stock. This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman. This is free money with a shovel. The WSB play isn’t to YOLO weeklies — it’s to buy, hold, and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion. GOLD TO THE MOON. BARRICK TO VALHALLA. I am not a financial advisor. I am, however, extremely bullish and slightly intoxicated. Positions Below ya regards, screenshot for proof 35C january 2027 40C january 2027",

This is the antimeme stock . This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman . This is free money with a shovel . The WSB play isn ’ t to YOLO weeklies — it ’ s to buy hold and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion . GOLD TO THE MOON . BARRICK TO VALHALLA .

      "selftext": "# RGTI Insiders still selling Latest sells were on 21-Nov by CFO and CTO. CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $12/share [openinsider]( And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue, what are insiders doing? Still selling. The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company. Zero. Some people defend this by saying he has stock options, but that is not the same as owning the stock. For a company this young and unproven, a leader should have skin in the game. The people running this company are cashing out, not buying in. The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits. # $1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $12-$15 range is the right play, and the latest 10-Q report proves my point. I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025, and the business is actually getting worse. Their revenue for the last nine months was only $5.2 million. That is a massive drop from the $8.5 million they made in the same period last year. A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag. So how are they staying alive? By printing a ridiculous number of new shares. They burned through over $41 million in cash in just nine months. To cover that, they sold nearly $347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering. They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself cannot generate enough cash. This is not a sign of a healthy company; it is a sign of continuing desperation. # Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Here's RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025: [ ..and Mckinsey & Co.: position 250 RGTZ - (inverse w/ 2x leverage)",

CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $ 12share openinsider And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue what are insiders doing Still selling . The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company . Zero . Some people defend this by saying he has stock options but that is not_the same as owning the stock . For a company this young and unproven a leader should have skin in the game . The people running this company are cashing out not_buying in . The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits . $ 1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $ 8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $ 12 $ 15 range is the right play and the latest 10Q report proves my point . I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025 and the business is actually getting worse . Their revenue for the last nine months was only $ 5.2 million . That is a massive drop from the $ 8.5 million they made in the same period last year . A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag . So how are they staying alive By printing a ridiculous number of new shares . They burned through over $ 41 million in cash in just nine months . To cover that they sold nearly $ 347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering . They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself can not generate enough cash . This is not_a sign of a healthy company it is a sign of continuing desperation . Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Heres RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025 .. and Mckinsey Co. position 250 RGTZ inverse w 2x leverage"

I (28M) have been working a corporate job since graduating college (~$85k salary), but only really started getting into investing around 3 years ago. My current breakdown looks like this: HYSA: ~$20k saved ($2,650 average monthly cost, 6 month safety accrued) - Saving around $700 per month 401(k): ~$21k invested (investing 4.5% with 100% company match at 4.5%) - Aggressive portfolio type, large cap markets and some mid cap markets only ROTH: ~$17k invested (try to put $540 in monthly, split between 90% S&P, 10% international) Personal Investments: ~$4k invested (mostly S&P with a handful of other stocks) - Investments are sporadic, thinking of cutting half of my savings moving forward and investing (e.g. $350 into HYSA, $350 into personal investments) - Also thinking of taking any interest earned on my HYSA, and putting into personal investments Let me know if there’s anything more I can do! Living in a HCOL city makes things a bit trickier, but want to try to streamline my investment process as much as possible!",

      "selftext": "No paywall: [ NVIDIA and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS) today announced an expanded, strategic partnership to revolutionize design and engineering across industries. R&D teams, from the semiconductor industry to aerospace, automotive, industrial and beyond, face significant engineering challenges including increasing workflow complexity, escalating development costs and time-to-market pressure. This expanded partnership will integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’ market-leading engineering solutions to deliver capabilities enabling R&D teams to design, simulate and verify intelligent products with greater precision, speed and at lower cost. In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. “CUDA GPU-accelerated computing is revolutionizing design — enabling simulation at unprecedented speed and scale, from atoms to transistors, from chips to complete systems, creating fully functional digital twins inside the computer,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design — empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future.” “The complexity and cost of developing next-generation intelligent systems demands engineering solutions with a deeper integration of electronics and physics, accelerated by AI capabilities and compute. No two companies are better positioned to deliver AI-powered, holistic system design solutions than Synopsys and NVIDIA,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. “Together we will re-engineer engineering and empower innovators everywhere to more efficiently realize their innovations.” **Joint Development to Enable Future of Engineering on Accelerated Computing** The multiyear partnership builds on strong, existing technology collaborations between the companies and includes the following initiatives: * **Broadly accelerate Synopsys applications:** Using NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries and AI physics technologies, Synopsys will further accelerate and optimize its broad portfolio of compute-intensive applications spanning chip design, physical verification, molecular simulations, electromagnetic analysis, optical simulation and more. * ​**Advance agentic AI engineering:** Building on the existing AI collaboration to enable agentic AI workflows, the companies are integrating Synopsys AgentEngineer™ technology with the NVIDIA agentic AI technology stack — including NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, NVIDIA NeMo™ Agent Toolkit software and NVIDIA Nemotron™ models — to enable autonomous design capabilities for electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation and analysis workflows. * ​**Connect the physical and digital worlds through digital twins:** The companies will collaborate to enable the next generation of virtual design, testing and validation through the use of highly accurate and sophisticated digital twins for industries such as semiconductor, robotics, aerospace, automotive, energy, industrial, healthcare and beyond. These solutions will utilize NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and other technologies. * ​**Cloud-ready solutions:** Synopsys and NVIDIA plan to make the power of accelerated engineering solutions accessible to engineering teams of all sizes by enabling cloud access for GPU-accelerated engineering solutions. * ​**Develop joint go-to-market initiatives:** To drive market adoption, the companies also have agreed to develop joint go-to-market initiatives to broadly reach engineering teams across multiple industries with both on-premise and cloud-ready solutions. This go-to-market effort will utilize Synopsys’ global network of thousands of direct sellers and channel partners, building on Synopsys’ broad customer base and existing agreement to license, sell and support Omniverse technology embedded in Synopsys simulation solutions. This partnership is not exclusive. NVIDIA and Synopsys continue to partner with the broader semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) ecosystem to create shared growth opportunities for the future of engineering and design.",

      "selftext": "I am writing this on my phone. So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes. What IOVA does? Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors. (Roughly over 90%, remaining 10% being Blood) Their product, Amtagvi (lifileucel), is a one-time TIL therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Doctors take T cells from the tumor, Iovance expands them into billions, and those cells get infused back into the patient. Very intuitive, essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer. Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real, durable responses. This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers. Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works. I hold 30,000 shares. 2) Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths. You may have heard of CAR-T but that doesn’t work on them. They only work for blood cancer which is only 10% of TAM, rest being Soldin tumor cancer. Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment, and 2L severely lacking treatment. If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers, the market is massive. Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD. Add cervical, NSCLC, head and neck, ovarian: the upside gets wide quickly. In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications, with several already in late stage phase 3. The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat. And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area. With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment. NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space. No other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is. They have their own manufacturing facilities that’s worth 1 billion USD itself. 3) Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid-2024. Early numbers: • Q2: around $31M • Q3: around $62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter. 70+ treatment centers active or onboarding. Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250-300M range. And management has reiterated their range for EOY. For a ~$1B market cap company, that’s extremely low valuation. 3) Bear Case arguments that don’t hold water Execution: With IOVA bears and shorts never questioned the science but about the execution. I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible. However, they bought in a new CFO (Corleen Roche) in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40% in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption: This was another pain point, during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA. Since, it is a Novel treatment. Patient referrals by Doctors was slow, and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process. In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson (The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies). The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff. Q4 will be explosive. Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write: 1. Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast. If they keep beating, the market re-rates this quickly. Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target. Q4 will be huge for this stock 2. New indications Cervical cancer filing potential. NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval First-line melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3. 3. Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway. (UK is already approved but not announced) Canada already approved. 4. Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time = more patients = more revenue. 5. Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable, any major pharma would want this platform. 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy Long-Term Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors, this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers. The total addressable market becomes enormous. At least $30B and at current share prices that’s $75 per share. Even if you are super bear about this stock at $10 minimum is already better than its current price. Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock. First-in-class advantage, strong early sales, a huge melanoma market, and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers. If they execute, this isn’t a 5 percent upside story. It’s potentially several multiples. This is why I’m long 30K shares. Risks Not sugarcoated: • Manufacturing is complex. • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong. Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail. But highly unlikely given its recent data release. It’s incredible • Volatility is brutal. Shorts have been at this stock with about 35% shorted. However, about 80-90% is owned by Institutions. Big names like Blackrock, GS , etc.. • They’ve diluted before and might again if sales don’t scale fast enough. But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don’t buy this thinking it’s a safe biotech. You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks. And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy, real revenue, growing adoption, a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers, and a valuation priced like it’s dead. I’m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science, the market, and the timing actually line up. If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts, this has legitimate multi-bagger potential. Q4 will be turning point. Get in before the stock rips. It will create generational wealth. If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn’t complete vapor, this is one of the few worth watching.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am writing this on my phone . So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes . What IOVA does Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors . Roughly over 90 % remaining 10 % being Blood Their product Amtagvi lifileucel is a onetime TIL therapy tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes . Doctors take T cells from the tumor Iovance expands them into billions and those cells get infused back into the patient . Very intuitive essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer . Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real durable responses . This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers . Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works . I hold 30000 shares . 2 Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths . You may have heard of CART but that doesn ’ t work on them . They only work for blood cancer which is only 10 % of TAM rest being Soldin tumor cancer . Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment and 2L severely lacking treatment . If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers the market is massive . Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD . Add cervical NSCLC head and neck ovarian the upside gets wide quickly . In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications with several already in late stage phase 3 . The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat . And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area . With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment . NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space . No_other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is . They have their own manufacturing facilities that ’ s worth 1 billion USD itself . 3 Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid2024 . Early numbers • Q2 around $ 31M • Q3 around $ 62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter . 70 treatment centers active or onboarding . Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250300M range . And management has reiterated their range for EOY . For a $ 1B market cap company that ’ s extremely low valuation . 3 Bear Case arguments that don ’ t hold water Execution With IOVA bears and shorts never_questioned the science but about the execution . I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible . However they bought in a new CFO Corleen Roche in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40 % in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption This was another pain point during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA . Since it is a Novel treatment . Patient referrals by Doctors was slow and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process . In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies . The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff . Q4 will be explosive . Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write 1 . Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast . If they keep beating the market rerates this quickly . Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target . Q4 will be huge for this stock 2 . New indications Cervical cancer filing potential . NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval Firstline melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3 . 3 . Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway . UK is already approved but not_announced Canada already approved . 4 . Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time more patients more revenue . 5 . Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable any major pharma would want this platform . 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy LongTerm Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers . The total addressable market becomes enormous . At least $ 30B and at current share prices that ’ s $ 75 per share . Even if you are super bear about this stock at $ 10 minimum is already better than its current price . Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock . Firstinclass advantage strong early sales a huge melanoma market and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers . If they execute this isn ’ t a 5 percent upside story . It ’ s potentially several multiples . This is why I ’ m long 30K shares . Risks Not_sugarcoated • Manufacturing is complex . • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong . Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail . But highly unlikely given its recent data release . It ’ s incredible • Volatility is brutal . Shorts have been at this stock with about 35 % shorted . However about 8090 % is owned by Institutions . Big names like Blackrock GS etc .. • They ’ ve diluted before and might again if sales don ’ t scale fast enough . But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don ’ t buy this thinking it ’ s a safe biotech . You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks . And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy real revenue growing adoption a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers and a valuation priced like it ’ s dead . I ’ m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science the market and the timing actually line up . If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts this has legitimate multibagger potential . Q4 will be turning point . Get in before the stock rips . It will create generational wealth . If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn ’ t complete vapor this is one of the few worth watching ."

      "title": "Why Some Commercial Biotech Companies Get Valued on Trailing Revenue Instead of Forward Expectations",
      "selftext": "Over the past year I’ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercial-stage biotech companies. Unlike most sectors, which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue, early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter. This creates situations where companies with FDA approval, real product sales, and multi-year cash runways still get priced as if nothing meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two. One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer’s drug called Zunveyl into long-term care earlier this year. They reported a little over $2.6 million in product revenue last quarter, and early adoption from facilities has been steady, but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering, solid QoQ growth. It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech. Is this caution justified, or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase? [](",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I, 20M, invest 2,500 dollars a month. I do an on/off split where one month I do the full 2,500 into my stocks/ETfs, and the next month I’ll do 2,100 into stocks/ETFs, but 400 into crypto (only BTC and ETH, 200 dollars each) As we’ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately (BTC is well below 90k at the moment) and it leads me questioning, should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do? Or just put my money straight into my stocks/ETS, and don’t do crypto? I mainly see crypto as a gamble. Not as an investment, I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype, I’m not really sure what my money is even going into. Any, and all advice is welcome! I plan to be in the market for a very very long time. Thank you for taking time to read this and reply :)",

I do an onoff split where one month I do the full 2500 into my stocksETfs and the next month I ’ ll do 2100 into stocksETFs but 400 into crypto only BTC and ETH 200 dollars each As we ’ ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately BTC is well below 90k at the moment and it leads me questioning should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do Or just put my money straight into my stocksETS and don ’ t do crypto I mainly see crypto as a gamble . Not_as an investment I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype I ’ m not_really sure what my money is even going into . Any and all advice is welcome I plan to be in the market for a very very long time . Thank you for taking time to read this and reply"

      "selftext": "I have spent past couple years researching what causes new investors and traders to consistently lose money… patterns that are rarely discussed in traditional finance books. While writing a book on the subject, I noticed some surprising trends. Three common traps every trader falls into: 1. Chasing hype: buying stock because “it feels right” or everyone is talking about it. 2. Ignoring red flags: small warnings signs in chart or social sentiment are overlooked. 3. Emotional overthinking: overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades. I’m genuinely curious, which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friends/family fall for? Have you ever read a finance book that actually warned you about these mistakes or do most books just gloss over emotional side of trading?",

While writing a book on the subject I noticed some surprising trends . Three common traps every trader falls into 1 . Chasing hype buying stock because “ it feels right ” or everyone is talking about it . 2 . Ignoring red flags small warnings signs in chart or social sentiment are overlooked . 3 . Emotional overthinking overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades . I ’ m genuinely curious which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friendsfamily fall for Have you ever read a finance book that actually warned you about these mistakes or do most books just gloss over emotional side of trading"

      "selftext": "Note: \"Weak consumer spending\" refers to store expectations before the season started. Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No paywall: [ >Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season. Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza. >As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade. >Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012. >The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024. >Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. >Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.) >“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.” >Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said. >The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior. >Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year. >A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.” >Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found. >Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide? >The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending. >Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring. >“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Weak consumer spending refers to store expectations before the season started . Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No_paywall Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season . Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza . As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade . Challenger Gray Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012 . The National Retail Federation a trade group also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season plans to bring on extra staff could be at “ the lowest level in more than 15 years. ” Retailers were expected to bring on 265000 to 365000 seasonal workers compared to 442000 in 2024 . Interest in seasonal work though remains plenty high — up 27 % at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board according to Cory Stahle a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab . Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7 % from a year ago and still below prepandemic levels . Indeed ’ s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall such as in accounting and ski resorts rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail Stahle said . “ I think it ’ s very telling that we ’ re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago ” Stahle said . “ There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall. ” Retail especially has “ just really pulled back ” he said . The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119000 positions that month though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts . The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare food services and drinking places and social assistance and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior . Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans . Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year . A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach saying “ For the past few years we ’ ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates . It ’ s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive. ” Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a Kshaped economy . A recent survey of 1048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America ’ s Future found that 68 % of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year while 59 % anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year . Just 5 % of respondents were actively hiring or expanding while 16 % were scaling back the survey found . Read more What is a Kshaped economy and whats causing the divide The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending . Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring . “ Employers aren ’ t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through or to the degree in which people are going to spend and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing ” Stahle said ."

After losing some money by following trends and not knowing what i was doing, i was financially down a bit with some of my first investments as a person now in my 20s. But the past 2 weeks Ive been greening just about everyday. I know how to time when i stock shoots up, i know when to sell now. I know what to look for. I just really need payoff. I'm tired of seeing other people get their payday. I want to know my intuition will turn into something. I want this week to be one i remember. I know it’s about balance and not letting my emotions get in the way. Edit: Do not harass me and insult me for my posts about investing. It is my interest and it’s a public forum. If I am on topic there is no reason for these targets on my character. I have done nothing wrong but post about overcoming my losses with solid profit and trusting my own abilities.",

      "selftext": "Hey folks, Relatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \\~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \\~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. Profile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\\~30k) looks something like this: ETFs: \\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN) \\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6) \\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) Stocks: \\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML \\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech & Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays. \\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close. Before you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. Eventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. Can you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives? I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons. Lastly, I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO, QQQ and others. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey folks Relatively new investor here just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security . I have a pretty high risk tolerance for 50 % of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and 50 % in long term 20 year ETFs as retirement fund . Profile 33M single no_kids western Europe low mortgage low expenses have a 3 month safety net monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 500 per month with the following portfolio goal note my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs . My current portfolio 30k looks something like this ETFs 30 % Amundi Prime AllWorld WEBN 10 % Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc LYP6 5 % WisdomTree Europe Defence EUDF Stocks 30 % across 10 medium term high conviction TechAI GOOGL MSFT NVDA META AMD AVGO NBIS SOFI ASML 20 % across 20 or so shortmedium term low conviction Tech Other stocks I won´t list them but everything from AMZ VRT IREN TSMC MU BABA RKLB ASTS and some utilities raw materials etc generally speculative plays . 5 % I consider noise learning experiences minor investments of 5 50 eur which I´ll gradually close . Before you all jump down my throat I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated . Given my risk profile I am happy to keep 30 40 % of portfolio within the growthtech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble . I am also happy to keep 10 % in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so . For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments . Eventually as I get older and want more security I will aim for 6070 % ETFs maybe some other assets like goldreal estatebonds etc so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant . I´m considering adding something like FTSE AllWorld High Dividend Yield Acc VHYG or an Emerging MarketsexUS fund . I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns sector rotations crashes . I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable defensive consumerutility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions . I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s hightech or highUS given the above allocation . Can you give me your thoughts on this Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more Should I stick to WEBN LYP6 or any better alternatives I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies and want to allocate accordingly e.g . I do not_want to invest in PLTR APPL TSLA for reasons . Lastly I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO QQQ and others . Thanks"

Imagine you have a supervisor named Mike, a CFA charterholder and professional investor with 20 years of experience who can obviously spot common mistakes rapidly.

Your goal is to be as mediocre an investor can be as possible while still fooling Mike into thinking you're doing fine while still actively sabotaging yourself in the long term, so how would you do so?",

Imagine you have a supervisor named Mike a CFA charterholder and professional investor with 20 years of experience who can obviously spot common mistakes rapidly . Mike has advised you to write your own investment memo and he will come back every Quarter to revise both your individual stock picks evaluating the businesses your broader asset allocation ETFs commodities bonds etc and your own research supporting each position . Your goal is to be as mediocre an investor can be as possible while still fooling Mike into thinking youre doing fine while still actively sabotaging yourself in the long term so how would you do so"
