      "title": "Figma Bull Case",
      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

Is a basket of basically Mag7 stocks - with some data center and defense additions - a solid portfolio for next 5-10 years or is concentration risk too much? (also got another 100-120k coming to deploy in a few months) Here are my 3 scenarios: 1 - MAG7 stocks with highest weight in AMZN, with some extra picks - TSM, SHLD, VRT, PWR, RYCEY, ABBNY (yea all at highs) 2 - Keep large base in VOO(60-70%?) - add high confiction singles - AMZM, NVDA, TSM, VRT, SHLD 3 - just 100% VOO and dont pick winners My brain is telling me 1 is too high on concentration risk but on the other hand the market is basically just the mag 7 right now anyway. any thoughts appreciated",

If I can’t see what the model is actually keying off of, I’m basically just replacing my hunches with a robot’s hunches. I already let AI write my grocery list. Not sure I’m ready to let it steer my kid’s college fund. Right now I’m treating these as a second opinion and a watchlist filter. Paper trading first, keeping position sizes small, and sanity checking with fundamentals and risk. Curious if anyone here has a real process for evaluating AI signals. Walk-forward testing? Out-of-sample periods? Shadow portfolios? If you’ve tried an AI picker that actually helped your process, what made it useful instead of hype? Features you found essential vs gimmicky? Would love to hear how you’re integrating this stuff. NFA, obviously.",

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

      "selftext": "My two cents on Petco. Petco’s equity is priced for bankruptcy, while its cash flow, liquidity, and credit markets price it as a surviving, self-funding business, creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize. The company is trading at \\~5.5x EBITDA and a \\~11-13% FCF yield on normalized numbers. The balance sheet, while levered, is structured with a long runway (2028) and flexible covenants. The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation. Just a point I want to make, most screeners show Petco trading at EV/EBITDA of \\~11x, whilst showing the EV as \\~$3.55 billion. I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet. The cost of these leases have already hit the P&L through either COGS or SG&A. EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders. The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric. If we want to include operating leases as part of EV, the we should use the EBITDAR metric. Alternatively, we can just strip out the operating leases. The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event. This framing is wrong. Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF, a covenant lite capital structure, no meaningful debt maturities until 2028, credit markets signalling survival, not distress. The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not support. For equity to be impaired, three conditions must occur simultaneously: 1. Material EBITDA collapse 2. Inability to service interest 3. Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21% YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue, interest is covered \\~3x, the \\~$1.6 billion Term Loan is covenant-lite and matures in 2028, the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability. Petco is now self-funding and does not rely on capital markets to operate. This is not a growth story. Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization, continued FCF generation, gradual deleveraging toward \\~3x net leverage. Under this base case, bankruptcy risk collapses, short interest (\\~20%) unwinds and the stock rerates from \\~5.5x to \\~7x EV/EBITDA. This implies \\~50–70% upside without heroic assumptions. Even in a stressed scenario (continued revenue decline, margin pressure, tariffs), interest remains covered, FCF remains positive, and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months. Downside is owning a slow growth, cash generative retailer, not a zero. The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not support. If the company simply stabilizes, the equity is materially undervalued. Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this.",

      "selftext_processed": "My two cents on Petco . Petco ’ s equity is priced for bankruptcy while its cash flow liquidity and credit markets price it as a surviving selffunding business creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize . The company is trading at 5.5x EBITDA and a 1113 % FCF yield on normalized numbers . The balance sheet while levered is structured with a long runway 2028 and flexible covenants . The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation . Just a point I want to make most screeners show Petco trading at EVEBITDA of 11x whilst showing the EV as $ 3.55 billion . I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet . The cost of these leases have already hit the PL through either COGS or SGA . EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders . The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric . If we want to include operating leases as part of EV the we should use the EBITDAR metric . Alternatively we can just strip out the operating leases . The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event . This framing is wrong . Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF a covenant lite capital structure no_meaningful debt maturities until 2028 credit markets signalling survival not_distress . The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not_support . For equity to be impaired three conditions must occur simultaneously 1 . Material EBITDA collapse 2 . Inability to service interest 3 . Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21 % YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue interest is covered 3x the $ 1.6 billion Term Loan is covenantlite and matures in 2028 the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability . Petco is now selffunding and does not_rely on capital markets to operate . This is not_a growth story . Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization continued FCF generation gradual deleveraging toward 3x net leverage . Under this base case bankruptcy risk collapses short interest 20 % unwinds and the stock rerates from 5.5x to 7x EVEBITDA . This implies 50–70 % upside without heroic assumptions . Even in a stressed scenario continued revenue decline margin pressure tariffs interest remains covered FCF remains positive and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months . Downside is owning a slow growth cash generative retailer not_a zero . The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not_support . If the company simply stabilizes the equity is materially undervalued . Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this ."

They are adding 150 more stores to the drone delivery network. * Once the expansion is complete, Wing will operate from 270 Walmart stores and serve 10% of the US population. * ​Last mile delivery is the most expensive part of the supply chain. If Wing can prove unit economic viability at scale, it will be a huge margin saver for Walmart. ​**Walmart integrates Gemini for AI assisted shopping** * ​Walmart is is adding Gemini directly into the shopping experience. * This allows for native checkout where users can discover, select and checkout via Google Pay directly within the Gemini interface. **Google launches a new AI Agent Commerce Protocol** * ​Google announced a new open standard called the Universal Commerce Protocol (UCP) for AI agent based shopping. * This has been co-developed with Shopify, Etsy, Wayfair, Target, and Walmart. * Payments would be via Google Pay or Paypal. ​ --------------- Sources: ​",

      "selftext": "Hi, so I've bought the following stocks right after I finished school and started earning some money before I started attending university around 2020: Zscaler, UI Patch, Roku, Digital Ocean, Upstart Holdings, Teamviewer, Docusign, Fiverr, Unity Software Back then I thought it was a smart idea to invest the little money I had from the part time jobs I was working to \"get a head start\" into adult life. The problem was that I definitely didnt do any research on the stocks I bought. I let myself be guided by articles from unreputable sources and people whose interest was simply to get you to buy their subscription for \"stock recommendations\" and literally paid the price, The total amount of 2200€ I invested back then are only worth 1000€ today. Luckily, I learned a lot since then, gratuated, started investing a fixed amount of money into the S&P on a monthly basis and bought a few stocks I actually did my own research on. Basically, I turned it around and I am now much happier with how my portfolio looks today than it did around 5~6 years ago. Still, everytime I scroll down to these stocks in my portfolio I get embarrased of my own actions and even though I know it would be the correct move, it's hard to sell these stocks at a loss. I know that by selling I have to finally admit to myself that my actions were stupid, and that's not easy. Sure, the amount of money is small compared to my portfolio today or what I earn now that I have a good job, but when it comes to these stocks my mind goes back to 2020 version of myself when I sent money from my regular banking account into my investment account for the first time and feeling Like a king for investing into the stock market that I Always heard about in the news. Somehow it kept me from acting rationally all these years. Anyway, feel free to laugh at me for crying over losing 1200€ but also feel free to share your own story or words of advise, I'll gladly read them! Good luck!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi so Ive bought the following stocks right after I finished school and started earning some money before I started attending university around 2020 Zscaler UI Patch Roku Digital Ocean Upstart Holdings Teamviewer Docusign Fiverr Unity Software Back then I thought it was a smart idea to invest the little money I had from the part time jobs I was working to get a head start into adult life . The problem was that I definitely didnt do any research on the stocks I bought . I let myself be guided by articles from unreputable sources and people whose interest was simply to get you to buy their subscription for stock recommendations and literally paid the price The total amount of 2200€ I invested back then are only worth 1000€ today . Luckily I learned a lot since then gratuated started investing a fixed amount of money into the SP on a monthly basis and bought a few stocks I actually did my own research on . Basically I turned it around and I am now much happier with how my portfolio looks today than it did around 56 years ago . Still everytime I scroll down to these stocks in my portfolio I get embarrased of my own actions and even though I know it would be the correct move its hard to sell these stocks at a loss . I know that by selling I have to finally admit to myself that my actions were stupid and thats not_easy . Sure the amount of money is small compared to my portfolio today or what I earn now that I have a good job but when it comes to these stocks my mind goes back to 2020 version of myself when I sent money from my regular banking account into my investment account for the first time and feeling Like a king for investing into the stock market that I Always heard about in the news . Somehow it kept me from acting rationally all these years . Anyway feel free to laugh at me for crying over losing 1200€ but also feel free to share your own story or words of advise Ill gladly read them Good luck"

      "selftext": "How many people are honestly still investing in stocks *just* to study fundamentals Because, honestly, I’m starting to doubt it. What’s the point of investing in the first place? Isn’t it to maximize returns? Isn’t it to beat inflation? I trade more on the short-term side, and yeah, it’s been working for me. But the moment I mention I’ve owned Tesla or ASTS, someone always jumps in like Bro, that’s just speculation Okay. So what if it is? People love to talk about value. Like unless you’re talking earnings reports, P/E ratios, or DCF models, it somehow doesn’t count as real value. But to me, value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money *within a level of risk I’m comfortable with*? If a stock makes me money, improves my life, and moves me closer to the future I want, then yeah that’s a good stock *to me* Value isn’t something written in textbooks. It’s not just numbers in a spreadsheet. It shows up in your account balance. And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time. You’re a gambler You’ll blow up eventually You don’t understand investing Fine. I’ll say it. In a way, I *am* a gambler.But I’m not gambling on a quick jackpot. I’m gambling on being a better father. On my kids getting a better education. On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life. On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I’m gambling on the future. And I’m gambling with responsibility. So what about you?You’re gambling too. You’re gambling that the system always works. That markets stay rational. That the theories you learned never break.If your so called “value investing” keeps you stuck, while my “speculation” keeps pushing me closer to my goals, then who’s really closer to the point of investing?And if that makes me a gambler then fuck it. I’m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？",

What ’ s the point of investing in the first place Isn ’ t it to maximize returns Isn ’ t it to beat inflation I trade more on the shortterm side and yeah it ’ s been working for me . But the moment I mention I ’ ve owned Tesla or ASTS someone always jumps in like Bro that ’ s just speculation Okay . So what if it is People love to talk about value . Like unless you ’ re talking earnings reports PE ratios or DCF models it somehow doesn ’ t count as real value . But to me value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money within a level of risk I ’ m comfortable with If a stock makes me money improves my life and moves me closer to the future I want then yeah that ’ s a good stock to me Value isn ’ t something written in textbooks . It ’ s not_just numbers in a spreadsheet . It shows up in your account balance . And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time . You ’ re a gambler You ’ ll blow up eventually You don ’ t understand investing Fine . I ’ ll say it . In a way I am a gambler.But I ’ m not_gambling on a quick jackpot . I ’ m gambling on being a better father . On my kids getting a better education . On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life . On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I ’ m gambling on the future . And I ’ m gambling with responsibility . So what about youYou ’ re gambling too . You ’ re gambling that the system always works . That markets stay rational . That the theories you learned never_break.If your so called “ value investing ” keeps you stuck while my “ speculation ” keeps pushing me closer to my goals then who ’ s really closer to the point of investingAnd if that makes me a gambler then fuck it . I ’ m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？"

      "title": "Silver moonshot yolo on Pan American $PAAS",
      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls. Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not a financial professional in any capacity.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."

When you “buy” a stock on the app, Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood. What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform? Would it be worth transferring my portfolio? Additionally, are there any other secure, FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked?",

      "selftext": "As of the latest update (Jan 5, 2026), Strategy holds 673,783 BTC. With Bitcoin sitting around $90,600 today, that's roughly $61 BILLION in Bitcoin treasury value alone (closed Jan 9 at $157.33/share, market cap around $45.5B on most trackers). the math: We're getting $61B worth of Bitcoin for a $45-48B valuation. That's a 20-25%+ discount to fair NAV, something that almost NEVER happens with MSTR. Historically it trades at massive premiums (50-100%+) because of Saylor's leverage genius, future acquisition potential, and the \"Bitcoin yield\" play. But right now? After the recent volatility, unrealized loss noise, and all the MSCI FUD, the market seems like the biggest bargain in years. MSCI backed off full delisting and confirmed retention (with some new share caps), which removed the forced-selling overhang and sparked relief pump last week. Yet the stock still hasn't fully repriced the true value. Add in the fact they just stacked another 1,286 BTC early Jan, boosted cash reserves to $2.25B, probably ready for more buys, this discount won't last once BTC pushes back toward $100k+. This feels like a good entry point. Does this add up? Think we'll see premium flip back hard on the next leg up?",

      "title": "Looking for portfolio feedback- GGUS/UGL/Senior AUD bank bonds",
      "selftext": "I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this long-term strategy as an Australian investor (40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% AUD cash/senior bank bonds, 10% aussie miners/personal stock picks) with 20% bands, yearly rebalancing), where it could go wrong, and for constructive critique. The basic premise is that over the next 7-10 years, the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD (mean-reversion), and a number of other considerations, like higher US inflation to be expected. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold, but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower. In addition, I do not see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal. US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of Medicare/Social Security, and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze, so only inflation or higher taxation are viable long-term solutions (unless the US gets rid of the above). Given the political paralysis, higher taxation is unlikely, and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office (besides tariffs, which do not meaningfully compensate for tax cuts). GGUS is 80-100% overall AUD currency-hedged S&P500 exposure, UGL is 60%ish USD-denominated gold exposure, and the 20% cash/Australian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash. There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered, and how this portfolio would play out. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **1. War/Significant geopolitical event** GGUS will likely crash, UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos. Enables rebalancing. I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease (climate refugees etc.). **2. Persistent US inflation** Since I'm hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not a major concern for me, and since economically companies price based on inflation, I'm economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates (expected in the near term). Gold is also useful for this. **3. Stock market crash (bubble popping)** This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping. In the near term, stocks will fall. Gold may be mixed effects, there for rebalancing. Cash also there for rebalancing. Appears there's a long-term mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful. **4. Deflation** I don't believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in- central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates. However, under this scenario, the portfolio does lose considerable value. **5. Tariff death spiral** Stocks will crash, gold will likely soar as it's not dependent on government policy. Rebalance, buy the dip, TACO. **6. Bond vigilantes** This is possible in the next 5-10 years if inflation is too high and long-term bond investors are not happy with a dovish Fed's low interest rates. Cash/short-term senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing, and I'm happy to hold. Gold/cash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS. **7. The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds** I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio. Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting, slightly higher, but an additional risk I'm willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash. **8. Gold prices decrease** This is possible- gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing, likely because of saturation from miners. Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL, I may experience more losses as a result, but for me it's worth the insurance policy. In the long term, it's an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease, and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation. So I'm fine with this risk. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any future likely scenarios I haven't considered? I've also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past (\\~14-15%/annum) with okay drawdowns, not a predictor of future returns, but still. Ideally, I still would've preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40% portion (for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay), but that doesn't really exist in a liquid form. Perhaps the only semi-likely scenario I've thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together, but that's unlikely. **TL;DR:** I'm a young early-20's Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually. I'm stress testing a 40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% senior Australian bank bonds (QPON)/10% fun money portfolio (with 20% bands and yearly rebalancing) and would like some feedback/thoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term. The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes, and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons (see US debt-to-GDP), enabling higher returns in currency-hedged leveraged S&P500 and gold. If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF I'd be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40% portion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Id like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this longterm strategy as an Australian investor 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % AUD cashsenior bank bonds 10 % aussie minerspersonal stock picks with 20 % bands yearly rebalancing where it could go wrong and for constructive critique . The basic premise is that over the next 710 years the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD meanreversion and a number of other considerations like higher US inflation to be expected . This is for a number of reasons mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower . In addition I do not_see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debttoGDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal . US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of MedicareSocial Security and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze so only inflation or higher taxation are viable longterm solutions unless the US gets rid of the above . Given the political paralysis higher taxation is unlikely and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office besides tariffs which do not_meaningfully compensate for tax cuts . GGUS is 80100 % overall AUD currencyhedged SP500 exposure UGL is 60 % ish USDdenominated gold exposure and the 20 % cashAustralian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash . There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered and how this portfolio would play out . 1 . WarSignificant geopolitical event GGUS will likely crash UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos . Enables rebalancing . I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease climate refugees etc .. 2 . Persistent US inflation Since Im hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not_a major concern for me and since economically companies price based on inflation Im economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates expected in the near term . Gold is also useful for this . 3 . Stock market crash bubble popping This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping . In the near term stocks will fall . Gold may be mixed effects there for rebalancing . Cash also there for rebalancing . Appears theres a longterm mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful . 4 . Deflation I dont believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates . However under this scenario the portfolio does lose considerable value . 5 . Tariff death spiral Stocks will crash gold will likely soar as its not_dependent on government policy . Rebalance buy the dip TACO . 6 . Bond vigilantes This is possible in the next 510 years if inflation is too high and longterm bond investors are not_happy with a dovish Feds low interest rates . Cashshortterm senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing and Im happy to hold . Goldcash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS . 7 . The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio . Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting slightly higher but an additional risk Im willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash . 8 . Gold prices decrease This is possible gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing_likely because of saturation from miners . Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL I may experience more losses as a result but for me its worth the insurance policy . In the long term its an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation . So Im fine with this risk . Are there any future likely scenarios I havent considered Ive also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past 1415 % annum with okay drawdowns not_a predictor of future returns but still . Ideally I still wouldve preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40 % portion for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay but that doesnt really exist in a liquid form . Perhaps the only semilikely scenario Ive thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together but thats unlikely . TLDR Im a young early20s Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually . Im stress testing a 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % senior Australian bank bonds QPON10 % fun money portfolio with 20 % bands and yearly rebalancing and would like some feedbackthoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term . The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons see US debttoGDP enabling higher returns in currencyhedged leveraged SP500 and gold . If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF Id be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40 % portion ."

      "selftext": "Okay, so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not gotten a job. My sister is a data analyst who makes about $120k. Her whole team is getting fired (yahoo) and she has been saying how much trouble she's having in trying to get a senior data analyst job. She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help. She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs. When I look at online forums(like reddit) in regards to IT, Software, data, etc jobs... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only senior-level jobs are being sought out for. Juniors are flat out not getting hired. Now, as the tech market is clearly not doing well, I've talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields... I get the gist that nobody is having an easy time in the white collar industry. That white-collar is oversaturated... I'm guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from mid-level and senior-level positions. So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field... wouldn't this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market? I can see how in the short-term that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expenditures(employee expenses), but wouldn't this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm? Are these major ceo's even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports? Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up? Essentially the upper-middle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population. Btw my ASTS position is worth $500k w/ cost basis at $6.50 and I'm only working a part time job right now(my whole life actually). I went all-in on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021. I've honestly never had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected. The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $100-200B mkt cap company one day. Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs, they have 3billion current subscribers. This is not counting the people that live in remote areas and don't even own cell phones... the potential is enormous. That said, I want to move out of my parents(I'm 31M) and am scared a recession will kill my gains. I want to hold, but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $200k and get an apartment while I search for a full-time job. I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician, as I have a lot of experience(+10 yrs), but I have 3 degrees. In Philosophy, History, and Comp-Sci from a T-50 public university in the country. I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig, but seemingly nobody wants me. I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to. Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays?? What're your thoughts on AI, the economy, job market and their relationship with the stock market. Thanks...",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not_gotten a job . My sister is a data analyst who makes about $ 120k . Her whole team is getting fired yahoo and she has been saying how much trouble shes having in trying to get a senior data analyst job . She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help . She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs . When I look at online forumslike reddit in regards to IT Software data etc jobs ... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only seniorlevel jobs are being sought out for . Juniors are flat out not_getting hired . Now as the tech market is clearly not_doing well Ive talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields ... I get the gist that nobody_is having an easy time in the white collar industry . That whitecollar is oversaturated ... Im guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from midlevel and seniorlevel positions . So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field ... wouldnt this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market I can see how in the shortterm that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expendituresemployee expenses but wouldnt this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm Are these major ceos even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up Essentially the uppermiddle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population . Btw my ASTS position is worth $ 500k w cost basis at $ 6.50 and Im only working a part time job right nowmy whole life actually . I went allin on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021 . Ive honestly never_had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected . The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $ 100200B mkt cap company one day . Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs they have 3billion current subscribers . This is not_counting the people that live in remote areas and dont even own cell phones ... the potential is enormous . That said I want to move out of my parentsIm 31M and am scared a recession will kill my gains . I want to hold but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $ 200k and get an apartment while I search for a fulltime job . I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician as I have a lot of experience10 yrs but I have 3 degrees . In Philosophy History and CompSci from a T50 public university in the country . I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig but seemingly nobody_wants me . I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to . Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays Whatre your thoughts on AI the economy job market and their relationship with the stock market . Thanks ..."

      "selftext": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like, and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think there's a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet. These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava, down over like 70% from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend.. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago. 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs. Was down a half a month ago. Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI.. so its a good sign I think? And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and. Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I haven't even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if they're still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me",

      "selftext_processed": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think theres a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet . These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava down over like 70 % from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend .. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago . 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs . Was down a half a month ago . Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI .. so its a good sign I think And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never_even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and . Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I havent even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if theyre still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m currently looking to strengthen my portfolio with a long-term position (5 to 7 years) and I’m torn between Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). I already have a solid foundation in my portfolio (about 88- 90% in VEQT ETF), and I want to use my remaining weight to pick one of these two tech giants. I’m an investor who values stability but is looking for that extra growth \"boost\" over the next decade. My thoughts so far: Google: I like their dominance in search and the massive potential of YouTube. However, I’m curious about how people feel regarding their AI integration (Gemini) compared to competitors. Amazon: Their AWS margins are impressive and the retail side seems to be getting more efficient, but I wonder if the growth ceiling is closer than Google’s. My setup: I trade on Wealthsimple and I’m planning to hold regardless of short-term volatility. My question: For a 5-7 year hold, which one do you think offers the best risk/reward ratio right now? Should I favor Google’s advertising moat or Amazon’s cloud/logistics powerhouse? Thanks for your insights!\"",

      "selftext": "Disclosure: I am short ALK via put options. This is not investment advice. # Why Loyalty Programmes Matter Airlines only fly planes to get to those air mile profits. It's ungodly. Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $12BN when their market cap was $7BN. These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need. ALK has $2BN of debt secured against theirs. So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly, investors should pay very close attention. If this behaviour is not openly discussed and disclosed, but is eased into financial statements without comment, investors should get away first and ask questions later. # The Sparkling Diamond: Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership. Alaska is tied to Bank of America. Here's how it works: Bank of America uses Alaska's miles to induce customers to use their credit cards. When a customer earns miles, Alaska bills Bank of America immediately. The exact numbers aren't disclosed, but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays. When Alaska receives this cash, here's how it's accounted for: The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance - not the cost, the fair value. Per Alaska's 2023 10-K (the last time it was disclosed), this is about 0.75 cents per mile. This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability. The remaining 0.50 cents? That goes straight into \"Loyalty Other Revenue\" - i.e. profit - because there are no further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents. This is a stable, predictable relationship. I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022. Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies, but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent. Until Q2 2025. # The 10σ Anomaly |Period|Alaska σ|United σ|Delta σ|American σ| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Q3 2022|0.58|0.25|1.10|0.27| |Q4 2022|1.06|1.96|1.21|1.07| |Q1 2023|0.40|0.45|0.26|0.19| |Q2 2023|0.23|1.91|1.19|2.38| |Q3 2023|0.11|0.35|0.42|0.28| |Q4 2023|1.01|0.11|1.58|1.54| |Q1 2024|1.25|0.24|1.17|0.31| |Q2 2024|0.47|0.32|0.18|0.25| |Q3 2024|0.84|0.68|0.77|0.41| |Q4 2024|1.68|1.22|0.18|0.48| |Q1 2025|1.41|0.12|1.06|0.28| |Q2 2025|**10.40**|0.01|1.33|0.48| |Q3 2025|0.16|0.12|1.23|0.14| In Q2 2025, Alaska's issuance-to-revenue ratio deviated 10.40 standard deviations from its historical baseline. This isn't the universe ending though statistically it would be. This is a ratio that has completely broken down. There is $180M of liability (points issued) with no corresponding loyalty revenue. The points appeared on the books, but the profit that should accompany them did not. The temptation to grasp at Alaska's recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some re-balancing of the two programmes is irresistible. But where is the expense recorded? Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting? Not there either. Now look at the other side of the balance sheet. Receivables from Affinity Card Partners (read: Bank of America) jumped from $111M to $306M in a single quarter. Something has happened here. Some similar transactions have occurred. You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure. There is none. # The Sneaky Restatement That's not all that happened in Q2. Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10-Q, we find this rather vague statement: Every character in that note is drafted to make you think: \"This doesn't concern me.\" And if you did dig, you'd have a hard time finding what changed. It's two pages away from the affected number. What changed? They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $58M - a 49% revision. Why? No explanation. Just... cute. # Where Did the Money Go? Let's see what washed out in Q3. Receivables from BofA dropped by $129M. You'd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected. But look at the operating cash flow statement. It's not there. No corresponding inflow. Instead, $120M appeared in \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" What happened here? As an investor, I was confidently awaiting $120M in operating cash flow. Instead, all I know now is that as a non-current asset, there is no expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months. No explanation whatsoever. # Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too There's more trouble in this loyalty programme. When customers redeem miles, they can use them on Alaska's own aircraft or on partner airlines. On Alaska's own metal, the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway. But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash. In Q2 and Q3 2025, something extraordinary is happening. The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward - which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme. Partner redemption went from 13.5% of total in 2024, up by 400bp for the same period in 2025. If this is a step up or more significantly, a trend, then that is a material input to the $12BN. |Metric|Q1 2025|Q2 2025|Q3 2025| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |BofA Receivables|$111M|$306M|$177M| |Other Non-Current Assets|\\-|$316M|$436M| |Issuance/Revenue Ratio|Normal|10.40σ|Normal| The Q2 spike appeared. The Q3 \"resolution\" moved money sideways rather than into cash. The ratio reverted as quickly as it broke. This is not how normal business operations look. The absence of any disclosures point in the opposite direction. # What This Means I'm not alleging fraud. I'm pointing out that: 1. Alaska's loyalty economics produced a statistical impossibility in Q2 2025 2. The corresponding balance sheet movements cannot be reconciled from public disclosures 3. A $58M prior-period revision was buried with deliberately vague language 4. $120M migrated to non-current assets without explanation 5. Partner redemption economics are shifting materially A loyalty programme worth $12BN, securing $2BN of debt, with a 10σ accounting anomaly and no management commentary. That demands explanation. Alaska hasn't provided one.",

Its ungodly . Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $ 12BN when their market cap was $ 7BN . These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need . ALK has $ 2BN of debt secured against theirs . So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly investors should pay very close attention . If this behaviour is not_openly discussed and disclosed but is eased into financial statements without comment investors should get away first and ask questions later . The Sparkling Diamond Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership . Alaska is tied to Bank of America . Heres how it works Bank of America uses Alaskas miles to induce customers to use their credit cards . When a customer earns miles Alaska bills Bank of America immediately . The exact numbers arent disclosed but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays . When Alaska receives this cash heres how its accounted for The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance not_the cost the fair value . Per Alaskas 2023 10K the last time it was disclosed this is about 0.75 cents per mile . This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability . The remaining 0.50 cents That goes straight into Loyalty Other Revenue i.e . profit because there are no_further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents . This is a stable predictable relationship . I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022 . Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent . Until Q2 2025 .

This isnt the universe ending though statistically it would be . This is a ratio that has completely broken down . There is $ 180M of liability points issued with no_corresponding loyalty revenue . The points appeared on the books but the profit that should accompany them did not_The temptation to grasp at Alaskas recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some rebalancing of the two programmes is irresistible . But where is the expense recorded Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting Not_there either . Now look at the other side of the balance sheet . Receivables from Affinity Card Partners read Bank of America jumped from $ 111M to $ 306M in a single quarter . Something has happened here . Some similar transactions have occurred . You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure . There is none . The Sneaky Restatement Thats not_all that happened in Q2 . Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10Q we find this rather vague statement Every character in that note is drafted to make you think This doesnt concern me . And if you did dig youd have a hard time finding what changed . Its two pages away from the affected number . What changed They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $ 58M a 49 % revision . Why No_explanation . Just ... cute . Where Did the Money Go Lets see what washed out in Q3 . Receivables from BofA dropped by $ 129M . Youd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected . But look at the operating cash flow statement . Its not_there . No_corresponding inflow . Instead $ 120M appeared in Other NonCurrent Assets . What happened here As an investor I was confidently awaiting $ 120M in operating cash flow . Instead all I know now is that as a noncurrent asset there is no_expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months . No_explanation whatsoever . Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too Theres more trouble in this loyalty programme . When customers redeem miles they can use them on Alaskas own aircraft or on partner airlines . On Alaskas own metal the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway . But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash . In Q2 and Q3 2025 something extraordinary is happening . The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme . Partner redemption went from 13.5 % of total in 2024 up by 400bp for the same period in 2025 . If this is a step up or more significantly a trend then that is a material input to the $ 12BN .

The Q3 resolution moved money sideways rather than into cash . The ratio reverted as quickly as it broke . This is not_how normal business operations look . The absence of any disclosures point in the opposite direction . What This Means Im not_alleging fraud . Im pointing out that 1 . Alaskas loyalty economics produced a statistical impossibility in Q2 2025 2 . The corresponding balance sheet movements can not be reconciled from public disclosures 3 . A $ 58M priorperiod revision was buried with deliberately vague language 4 . $ 120M migrated to noncurrent assets without explanation 5 .

      "title": "My Clients Buying Silver: A Criticism",
      "selftext": "I’ll summarize my diatribe by saying- the moment you hear of people that simply cannot afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number, it’s time to reconsider your exposure. 2018, I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio‘s hedge against inflation. I got push back - “what inflation?”. my rebuttal was and has always been that we don’t invest solely based on what’s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude. inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises. rates were near zero, and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same. right around the time silver crossed the $40 range, I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buying/investing in silver. it seemed to be all the rage. many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position. For them, it was fine. but for the rest of the bunch, the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal. To what end will you invest in silver? where are you hoping to see it? why suddenly now? Mind you, our monetary policy and debt expansion is not anywhere near the free-and-easy regime we saw between ‘18 and ‘21. But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own. They watch what others do, see the price run up, catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it’s ‘all systems go’. My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price. could silver move to $100/oz? surely. could also reach $1,000. my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves. if theres a case for $100, then there’s also a case for $50. the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong? what would that loss do to your time horizon? the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out. this is also costly. opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis. Having said all that, I love silver. It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time. But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom: your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio. Taxes on silver gains, unlike cap gains on stocks, are inescapable. The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure. How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS? and does 28% sound like a fun haircut to get? Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run. Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room. 3 if you’re weird. Point being, it takes more angles to house a decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ll summarize my diatribe by saying the moment you hear of people that simply can not afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number it ’ s time to reconsider your exposure . 2018 I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio ‘ s hedge against inflation . I got push back “ what inflation ” . my rebuttal was and has always been that we don ’ t invest solely based on what ’ s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude . inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises . rates were near zero and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same . right around the time silver crossed the $ 40 range I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buyinginvesting in silver . it seemed to be all the rage . many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position . For them it was fine . but for the rest of the bunch the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal . To what end will you invest in silver where are you hoping to see it why suddenly now Mind you our monetary policy and debt expansion is not_anywhere near the freeandeasy regime we saw between ‘ 18 and ‘ 21 . But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own . They watch what others do see the price run up catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it ’ s ‘ all systems go ’ . My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price . could silver move to $ 100oz surely . could also reach $ 1000 . my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves . if theres a case for $ 100 then there ’ s also a case for $ 50 . the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong what would that loss do to your time horizon the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out . this is also costly . opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis . Having said all that I love silver . It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time . But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio . Taxes on silver gains unlike cap gains on stocks are inescapable . The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure . How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS and does 28 % sound like a fun haircut to get Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run . Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room . 3 if you ’ re weird . Point being it takes more angles to house a decision ."

      "selftext": "Hello! 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio. This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity, with a 20+ year horizon, aiming for long-term growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns. My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap (multiple S&P 500 funds, total market funds, growth funds, etc.). I’m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile. (Roth IRA is handled separately.) Below is how my current allocation looks today. As you’ll see, there’s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures. # Current Portfolio Allocation |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FXAIX|17.40%| |FDLXX|9.99%| |FSKAX|7.83%| |FZILX|5.95%| |SPY|5.90%| |VTI|5.47%| |VUG|5.44%| |FZROX|4.85%| |SOXX|4.61%| |FSELX|4.40%| |FTBFX|4.03%| |FSMDX|3.47%| |QQQ|3.44%| |FBGRX|3.20%| |VOO|3.05%| |FBALX|2.67%| |FCNTX|2.38%| |FSPTX|1.73%| |FPURX|1.57%| |FSPGX|1.19%| |FNILX|0.77%| |IAUM|0.43%| |FTIHX|0.23%| Option 1: ETF-based target allocation I’m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity, portability (in case I ever move away from Fidelity), and tax efficiency in a taxable account. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |VTI|25%| |VOO|25%| |VXUS|20%| |BND|10%| |VUG|8%| |SOXX|5%| |VO|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Option 2: Fidelity-native target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity, this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FSKAX|25%| |FXAIX|25%| |FTIHX|20%| |FTBFX|10%| |FSPGX|8%| |FSELX|5%| |FSMDX|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Looking for feedback on - Does this allocation make sense for 38 / long-term taxable investing? Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts? Would you simplify this further? Thoughts on VTI + VOO together vs a single US equity fund? Not trying to chase returns, mainly want something simple, diversified, and easy to stick with long term. Appreciate any input. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term (50 years). I planned to just put money in the s&p500 monthly, but I learned about small cap value + momentum being theoretically more rewarding. This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean. Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that. This post is for people that find it interesting to look at, but any judgement/advice is also welcome of course. My strategy is the following: Average ROI of US SCV ETF + World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF + World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months. The higher one gets a weight of 70. This is the dynamic factor allocation (relative performance between the factors, cross-factor momentum). The ETF’s are: ZPRV on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF (Italian stock exchange) on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF (English stock exchange) on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IE-domicile. Monthly contributions of €750 (at first, might increase when financial situation changes) with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 70/30 or 30/70 between the factors (SCV and momentum). Realistically between 20-40 and 60-80 is fine. Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 50/50, but +-10 difference is fine. Yearly rebalancing on fixed date (my birthday) if necessary. When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high, I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay. EDIT: based in Europe.",

I planned to just put money in the sp500 monthly but I learned about small cap value momentum being theoretically more rewarding . This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean . Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that . This post is for people that find it interesting to look at but any judgementadvice is also welcome of course . My strategy is the following Average ROI of US SCV ETF World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months . The higher one gets a weight of 70 . This is the dynamic factor allocation relative performance between the factors crossfactor momentum . The ETF ’ s are ZPRV on IBIS 2 German stock exchange on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF Italian stock exchange on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 German stock exchange on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF English stock exchange on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IEdomicile . Monthly contributions of €750 at first might increase when financial situation changes with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 7030 or 3070 between the factors SCV and momentum . Realistically between 2040 and 6080 is fine . Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 5050 but 10 difference is fine . Yearly rebalancing on fixed date my birthday if necessary . When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay . EDIT based in Europe ."

Which home builder stock do you think will benefit the most of the ones below? • Pultegroup (PHM): I think this will be the one to go to. Third largest home builder in volume, but much more importantly Bill Pulte the grandson of the founder is also currently the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Need I say more? • Lennar (LEN): second choice. Want to say this is the second largest homebuilder could be confusing this though. More importantly Stuart Miller (CEO) was part of Trump’s strategic and policy forum in the first admin. Also he hinted at talking to Trump admin late 2025 early this year about affordability/supply (in meetings that included other home builders). • D.R Horton (DHI): A high volume home builder, this company is actually the highest volume builder in the states. But I couldn’t find links to the admin here. Any other thoughts? Thinking of opening a position into lennar or pulte next wk.

      "selftext": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of micron's memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful. The stock was around 80$. So I picked it up. Sold it after some 20% gains. Did it twice or 3 times. However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not profitable. I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20% gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the (10% annual gain is good) rule. However in the crazy AI era, the bubble vs not bubble is not like any other. The conservative investor should not follow the trends. In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure. However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio. It should be away from tech. As I do not believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices. Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers' stocks. The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron. However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not be justified as there is no race anymore. I think of AI like the space race between superpowers. The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not equal or at least would not be growing (i.e. the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20% or 50% but very small probability that I do not care of). I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000$ from a weighted average of 2000$ scattered on 2.5 years. I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years. I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400$ sold it for 600$ then bought 800$ and sold 1000$. I can not stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else. Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains. So I'll start following the 80% 20% rule, 20 for the trading, 80 for long term investing. What good industries that set for continued growth in next 5-10 years, not financial institutions or consumer like Walmart. I aim for products or services that will improve people lives. I'll then start to look for some innovative companies either in its service/product or its way of doing them in better financial way. This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for people's advice here.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of microns memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful . The stock was around 80 $ . So I picked it up . Sold it after some 20 % gains . Did it twice or 3 times . However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not_profitable . I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20 % gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the 10 % annual gain is good rule . However in the crazy AI era the bubble vs not_bubble is not_like any other . The conservative investor should not_follow the trends . In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure . However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio . It should be away from tech . As I do not_believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices . Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers stocks . The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron . However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not_be justified as there is no_race anymore . I think of AI like the space race between superpowers . The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not_equal or at least would not_be growing i.e . the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20 % or 50 % but very small probability that I do not_care of . I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000 $ from a weighted average of 2000 $ scattered on 2.5 years . I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not_good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years . I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400 $ sold it for 600 $ then bought 800 $ and sold 1000 $ . I can not_stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else . Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains . So Ill start following the 80 % 20 % rule 20 for the trading 80 for long term investing . What good industries that set for continued growth in next 510 years not_financial institutions or consumer like Walmart . I aim for products or services that will improve people lives . Ill then start to look for some innovative companies either in its serviceproduct or its way of doing them in better financial way . This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for peoples advice here ."

      "selftext": "2025 had low transaction volume for home sales, the lowest turnover rate in decades, and the lowest rate of first time buyers EVER. With that being said I’m trying to land on a few housing adjacent plays to buy into in the next few years. I had looked into companies like Wayfair, Stanley decker, shark ninja, RH, and whirlpool (basically any companies that potentially stand to benefit from more people buying homes). One issue I have with Wayfair is it’s priced VERY high right now with a run up of $155% in the past year. Similarly shark ninja is a little bit pricey but undoubtedly has a solid and efficient business plan. Any companies you would recommend diving deeper into? Fully expect that it’ll be a few years before sales volumes really pick up again, but would rather start thinking through which tickers are positioned to make the most out of home sales increasing from all time lows. For reference you’ll see most of the stocks mentioned above had ATHs in 2020-2021; I don’t expect we’d see a buying season like that in at least the next ten years, BUT given a ton of these stocks tanked around low home sales and tariffs there is a run up they’d benefit from.",

With that being said I ’ m trying to land on a few housing adjacent plays to buy into in the next few years . I had looked into companies like Wayfair Stanley decker shark ninja RH and whirlpool basically any companies that potentially stand to benefit from more people buying homes . One issue I have with Wayfair is it ’ s priced VERY high right now with a run up of $ 155 % in the past year . Similarly shark ninja is a little bit pricey but undoubtedly has a solid and efficient business plan . Any companies you would recommend diving deeper into Fully expect that it ’ ll be a few years before sales volumes really pick up again but would rather start thinking through which tickers are positioned to make the most out of home sales increasing from all time lows . For reference you ’ ll see most of the stocks mentioned above had ATHs in 20202021 I don ’ t expect we ’ d see a buying season like that in at least the next ten years BUT given a ton of these stocks tanked around low home sales and tariffs there is a run up they ’ d benefit from ."

      "selftext": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $2.5. There was a -$82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners, likely from ticker collision between $VLN and $VLN Toronto. Because of this, algorithms modeled this company to have <1Y runway after spending $82 Million while in reality they still have $93M cash and $11m in inventory. Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday. Yet algorithms have not caught on yet, as they're still modeling negative EV from -$82M burn (this requires manual correction). Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to -$82M error on Stonegate, Streetwise, and scanners. $VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $255M market cap size. This is not due to company quality and it's definitely not some random micro stock. But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in <1Y runway from $82m burn. This is a extremely mispriced AI & Robotics fabless chipmaker with: \\- Mercedes \\- Samsung \\- Mobileye (EyeQ6) \\- Siemens \\- Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers. $VLN has \\- Zero Debt. \\- $93.5 Million Cash \\- $11 Million + in inventory. \\- \\~$80M+ est. forward revenue \\- 69.1% gross margins on their robotics/machine vision/industrial vertical (growing 40% Y/Y). Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0%. If you want to compare similar companies: \\- Lattice $LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EV/Revenue. \\- Macom $MTSI, trades around 13x and 16.5x. EV/Revenue. Valens trades at: 2.4x. Which looks like a glitch. Even non-premium, 20-30% gross margin, companies trade at 4-5x (more than double current prices). We now see an extreme mispricing of a $NVDA-margin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors. Even trading at a normal 10x EV/revenue (no premium) would be $893.5M/106.34M= \\-> $8.40 from $2.5. This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision.",

      "selftext_processed": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $ 2.5 . There was a $ 82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners likely from ticker collision between $ VLN and $ VLN Toronto . Because of this algorithms modeled this company to have 1Y runway after spending $ 82 Million while in reality they still have $ 93M cash and $ 11m in inventory . Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday . Yet algorithms have not_caught on yet as theyre still modeling negative EV from $ 82M burn this requires manual correction . Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to $ 82M error on Stonegate Streetwise and scanners . $ VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $ 255M market cap size . This is not_due to company quality and its definitely not_some random micro stock . But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in 1Y runway from $ 82m burn . This is a extremely mispriced AI Robotics fabless chipmaker with Mercedes Samsung Mobileye EyeQ6 Siemens Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers . $ VLN has Zero Debt . $ 93.5 Million Cash $ 11 Million in inventory . $ 80M est . forward revenue 69.1 % gross margins on their roboticsmachine visionindustrial vertical growing 40 % YY . Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0 % . If you want to compare similar companies Lattice $ LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EVRevenue . Macom $ MTSI trades around 13x and 16.5x . EVRevenue . Valens trades at 2.4x . Which looks like a glitch . Even nonpremium 2030 % gross margin companies trade at 45x more than double current prices . We now see an extreme mispricing of a $ NVDAmargin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors . Even trading at a normal 10x EVrevenue no premium would be $ 893.5M106.34M $ 8.40 from $ 2.5 . This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision ."

      "selftext": "Hey I will try to keep this brief, as of last week, a private investor(a) have bought up almost of the free float of NEGG. There are now about 20k shares of the float not held by insiders. Retail long has at least a few hundred thousand. And the currently reported short count (fintel) is about 270k. It could well be more of we factor in the institutional holds. The company has previously been off the boil, but has cleared debt, has been looking to expand and is developing AR PC gaming experiences. Oh and PC components have gone up faster than any other 'asset' due to the whole data center thing leading to market scarcity. RAM up 600% for example. Financials for NEGG are annually reported and are not due until March, but a turnaround to profitability is expected. Given the over subscription of the float, and outstanding short positions, things could get very interesting. Things may happen sooner than the business case evidence. But business turn around and timing is another factor that sets a positive outlook. If you haven't looked into it and you are interested in market anomalies, I think you may struggle to find tickers with a higher % of insider holds. Of course I am in NEGG and have been since September 25, but I feel like this latest 13D and tiny free float needs to be communicated to those that don't know. Happy to field any questions.",

If you havent looked into it and you are interested in market anomalies I think you may struggle to find tickers with a higher % of insider holds . Of course I am in NEGG and have been since September 25 but I feel like this latest 13D and tiny free float needs to be communicated to those that dont know . Happy to field any questions ."

The company whose customers include Nvidia and Apple has been a major beneficiary of advances in AI which has more than offset the tapering off of ⁠pandemicled demand for chips ‌used in consumer electronics like tablets . Revenue for the OctoberDecember period was T $ 1.046 trillion $ 33.11 billion according ‍to Reuters calculations based on monthly data released by the company compared with T $ 868.46 billion in the yearago period . The latest result beat a ​LSEG SmartEstimate of T $ 1.036 trillion $ 32.79 billion drawn from 20 analysts ‌and was in line with guidance of $ 32.2 billion to $ 33.4 billion issued by TSMC in October in its last earnings call . TSMC only gives guidance in U.S. dollars . TSMC will report full fourthquarter earnings on January 15 when it is expected ⁠to provide updated guidance for the ​current quarter and full year ​including its capital expenditure plans and revenue growth outlook . TSMCs Taipeilisted shares gained 44.2 % last year outperforming the ‍25.7 % rise ⁠for the broader market .

      "selftext": "Over the past couple of years, I started learning about investment and securities. Before then, I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never be able to understand. However, the deeper I go, the more angry and disillusioned I feel. What started as “invest in a company you believe in and grow with it” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement, no matter the method, no matter the ethics. It’s no longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow, it’s about speed, leverage, arbitrage, and squeezing edge out of anything that moves. Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself. Not from creating value. Not from improving products. Just from being faster, more aggressive, more optimised than the next guy. And it’s not just traditional markets. Look at crypto. In theory it was meant to democratise finance. In practice it’s become a playground for: - Rug pulls - Pump-and-dumps - Influencer scams - Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not to build, but to extract. The goal isn’t “grow something useful.” It’s “how do I get mine before everyone else does?” What bothers me most isn’t that some people are greedy, that’s human. It’s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage. If you hesitate, someone else front-runs you. If you care, someone else exploits the gap. At some point, it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose. I know markets are necessary. Capital has to flow. Risk has to be priced. But it feels like we’ve built a hyper-financialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it. And it leaves you wondering: Is this really what “investing” is supposed to be?",

      "selftext": "Trump has announced that credit card users are being charged interest rates of 20–30% and said he wants to impose a temporary cap of 10% for one year. I wonder how such a move would impact Visa and Mastercard as stocks. At the same time, I’m questioning the premise itself, credit card interest rates are set by issuing banks, not by Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks rather than lending businesses. If a rate cap were actually implemented, the direct financial impact would likely fall on banks rather than on Visa or Mastercard. Still, markets often react to headlines before nuance, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see short-term selling pressure on Visa and Mastercard driven by misunderstanding rather than fundamentals.",

I already got rejected from the research track and I’m waiting until April for the applied track results, but I’m worried I’m \"too old\" at 30 compared to the 20-year-olds with no experience they seem to prefer. The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold, and I’m still salty after losing 70% (due to currency devaluation) of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa. Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating, but I’m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k (around 18k USD, so 30% of my holdings at current prices) if I finally get the green light.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR around 60k USD in total Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions also I dont really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs . this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in a few months if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . Also currently no_income but in the future Id probably do at least 50 % SP500 then rest is depends on how the market is could be more sp500 .

I already got rejected from the research track and I ’ m waiting until April for the applied track results but I ’ m worried I ’ m too old at 30 compared to the 20yearolds with no_experience they seem to prefer . The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa . Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating but I ’ m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k around 18k USD so 30 % of my holdings at current prices if I finally get the green light ."

      "selftext": "My bull case: LSE:ARMG Structural demand: Defence spending is no longer cyclical it’s becoming structural (NATO commitments, geopolitics, re-armament). Tech focus: Exposure isn’t just traditional defence primes, but also AI, cyber, drones, space, and autonomous systems. Diversification: Holdings across US, Europe, and allies (e.g. Lockheed, RTX, BAE, Palantir, Thales, Saab). Policy tailwinds: Multi-year government contracts + long procurement cycles = revenue visibility. UCITS / unleveraged: Suitable for long-term holding, unlike single-stock or leveraged ETFs. Not risk-free, but as a thematic allocation to defence tech, ARMG looks well positioned for the next decade rather than just a short-term trade.",

      "title": "Crypto DATs are literally legal ponzi machine (BMNR / SBET / MSTR)",
      "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, I'm not against any digital asset treasuries (DATs), it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and it's legal. (Disclosure: I even have some position in some DATs) The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago, I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 2\\~3 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock, and I dismissed it as one of the \"stupid things in crypto\". But two weeks ago, I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20% discount on NAV, that piqued my interest, because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me, so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs, and if the opportunity is real or a trap. After some studying, and cut through all the bullshit terminology, I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is. # What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase, it'll probably be \"market irrationality harvester\", \"idiot harvesting machine\" or \"wealth transfer machine\" (transfer from idiot ofc). These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy, looks like a fund, but does not follow funds regulation or structure, a fund that has less transparency requirement, less protection for their shareholders (that's the point, it has to harvest the idiots). What the entire management do is very simple, they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean, ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock. The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type: * People who buy when the stock is below NAV (not necessarily mean they'll profit, more on this later.) * People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV (not necessarily mean they will lose money too! but **majority of them DO lose money**, they are the target to be harvested, or to be transfer wealth from.) Let's start with the simple one, why people who buy above the NAV will not necessarily lose money? Here's the ponzi part kicks in, because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV. To be fair though, many who bought above NAV knew this, just like in Ponzi, many know what they are getting into, but they just think they'll not be the last one holding the bag. (aka \"there'll be a greater fool\") Then there's people who buy the stock below NAV, these are usually people that'll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward, usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV, but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales, more on it next. # Accretive & Dilutive of DATs. Let me use a simple example, there's a stock with 1 million outstanding share, the entire value of the company is $1mil, so the NAV is exactly $1. In this example we'll assume the underlying asset value has no change and stay constant. Next, the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing, the stock price is now trading at $2 but the NAV stay unchanged, so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $2, raised $2mil and bought $2mil of underlying asset. Now there's 2 million outstanding shares, with $3mil underlying asset, the NAV of each share now becomes $1.5, this is **accretive**. Then some bad news happen, the stock price crashing from $2 to $1.5, then someone bought at $1.5, then it continue to crash to $1. At this point, the NAV is still $1.5, but the price of the stock is $1. For buyer at 3 difference price point * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.5 so they are fine for now. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, but they also know the NAV of the stock is $1.5 so they think they'll be fine. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, they figured out the NAV is $1.5 still below their entry price, they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock, to the same premium level for them to get out. Now for some reason, the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV, so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $1 price, raised another $1mil and bought the asset. Now there's 3 million outstanding share with $4mil underlying asset, the NAV becomes $1.33, falls from the previous $1.5 and this is **dilutive**. When this happen, all existing shareholders are equally harmed: * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.33, falling from previous $1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive, the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $1.33 they are still in lost, they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, the chance of them breakeven further decreases, as they require and even higher premium, and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point. So in conclusion, when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV, people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested. When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV, which happened before, and will likely happen again, all shareholders lose value in their share, the damage depends on what discount/premium level they got it. # Interest of the management is not aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part, unlike most of the Asset-based ETFs, there's a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premium/discount to keep the price close to the NAV, there's none for such DATs, and they are even worse than close end funds, because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market. The best part is, the management of these DATs doesn't necessarily care about the NAV per share, in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company, regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted. # So is there opportunity? Personally I think it's fine to make some risk calculated bet, especially when there's a deep discount on NAV, but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny, with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when it's dilutive. Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me, it amaze me because I never thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not create any production value at all, and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV, and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders, or the management itself. I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants, the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value, then stock like this should be banned, fined, or force to follow strict fund regulations. But anyway, I am not writing this because I care, I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the \"highly regulated\" stock market.",

      "selftext_processed": "Dont get me wrong Im not_against any digital asset treasuries DATs it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and its legal . Disclosure I even have some position in some DATs The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 23 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock and I dismissed it as one of the stupid things in crypto . But two weeks ago I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20 % discount on NAV that piqued my interest because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs and if the opportunity is real or a trap . After some studying and cut through all the bullshit terminology I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is . What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase itll probably be market irrationality harvester idiot harvesting machine or wealth transfer machine transfer from idiot ofc . These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy looks like a fund but does not_follow funds regulation or structure a fund that has less transparency requirement less protection for their shareholders thats the point it has to harvest the idiots . What the entire management do is very simple they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock . The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type People who buy when the stock is below NAV not necessarily mean theyll profit more on this later . People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV not necessarily mean they will lose money too but majority of them DO lose money they are the target to be harvested or to be transfer wealth from . Lets start with the simple one why people who buy above the NAV will not_necessarily lose money Heres the ponzi part kicks in because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV . To be fair though many who bought above NAV knew this just like in Ponzi many know what they are getting into but they just think theyll not_be the last one holding the bag . aka therell be a greater fool Then theres people who buy the stock below NAV these are usually people thatll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales more on it next . Accretive Dilutive of DATs . Let me use a simple example theres a stock with 1 million outstanding share the entire value of the company is $ 1mil so the NAV is exactly $ 1 . In this example well assume the underlying asset value has no_change and stay constant . Next the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing the stock price is now trading at $ 2 but the NAV stay unchanged so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $ 2 raised $ 2mil and bought $ 2mil of underlying asset . Now theres 2 million outstanding shares with $ 3mil underlying asset the NAV of each share now becomes $ 1.5 this is accretive . Then some bad news happen the stock price crashing from $ 2 to $ 1.5 then someone bought at $ 1.5 then it continue to crash to $ 1 . At this point the NAV is still $ 1.5 but the price of the stock is $ 1 . For buyer at 3 difference price point People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.5 so they are fine for now . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them but they also know the NAV of the stock is $ 1.5 so they think theyll be fine . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment they figured out the NAV is $ 1.5 still below their entry price they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock to the same premium level for them to get out . Now for some reason the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $ 1 price raised another $ 1mil and bought the asset . Now theres 3 million outstanding share with $ 4mil underlying asset the NAV becomes $ 1.33 falls from the previous $ 1.5 and this is dilutive . When this happen all existing shareholders are equally harmed People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.33 falling from previous $ 1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $ 1.33 they are still in lost they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment the chance of them breakeven further decreases as they require and even higher premium and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $ 1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point . So in conclusion when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested . When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV which happened before and will likely happen again all shareholders lose value in their share the damage depends on what discountpremium level they got it . Interest of the management is not_aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part unlike most of the Assetbased ETFs theres a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premiumdiscount to keep the price close to the NAV theres none for such DATs and they are even worse than close end funds because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market . The best part is the management of these DATs doesnt necessarily care about the NAV per share in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted . So is there opportunity Personally I think its fine to make some risk calculated bet especially when theres a deep discount on NAV but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when its dilutive . Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me it amaze me because I never_thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not_create any production value at all and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders or the management itself . I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value then stock like this should be banned fined or force to follow strict fund regulations . But anyway I am not_writing this because I care I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the highly regulated stock market ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week, and they printed. This morning I bought $CDE 1/23 $22 calls, and will be buying some longer-term calls next week. CDE made explosive moves today, crushing resistance. I can easily see this hitting $23 within the next couple of weeks, especially if silver holds strong. Here is a DD on the company: Coeur Mining (CDE) closed the day at $20.5, according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week and they printed . This morning I bought $ CDE 123 $ 22 calls and will be buying some longerterm calls next week . CDE made explosive moves today crushing resistance . I can easily see this hitting $ 23 within the next couple of weeks especially if silver holds strong . Here is a DD on the company Coeur Mining CDE closed the day at $ 20.5 according to VectorVest they are valued at 32.5 share . Therefore they are extremely undervalued . Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026 They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD a Canadian mining company . Once this merger goes through they will have 7 operations across North America . They will have the production capability of 900000oz of gold and 20000000oz of silver . They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit . They have had production expansion like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas . Therefore they are still growing . They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year . I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026 . Their debt is mostly longterm and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt . The coupon is fixed . I could not_find the allin sustaining cost but it cost them $ 248m to sell $ 554.6m worth of gold and silver . All their mines are considered to be in safe areas they have 3 in the US 2 in Mexico and 1 explorational site in BC . After the merger they will acquire more sites in Canada . So none of the mines will be politically impacted . They have no_active offering as a matter of fact they have a $ 75 million share buyback program valid through May 31 2026 . Their free cash flow is positive at $ 188M ."

      "selftext": "> President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent, in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail. “Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be ‘ripped off’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent,” Trump said in a social media post. > He said there would be a one-year cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20. It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House. > The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that the administration has suggested should not exist and has slashed funding for. Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday. The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November, according to Federal Reserve data, up from 12.9 percent in late 2013.",

      "selftext": "I lean towards value investing, and prefer to hold stocks for at least 3 years, but not necessarily. MU - Fantastic revenue, margins, and growth. First in class HBM dominance and NAND. I know its trading near 52 week highs, but I think forward PEG of 0.20x compared to sector median of 1.66x makes it compelling, even as I am trying to diversify away from AI stocks. AMD - I just fucking love Lisa Su. I think she's got a shot of rolling out HPC accelerators to give Nvidia's Vera Rubin some competition. The new Instincts and EPYC CPUs are impressive as well. I know its trades at a premium, but its forward PEG is roughly a 25% discount to the sector overall. ALL - Property and casualty insurance is resilient and inelastic. Near 200% YOY growth, implementing AI smartly, attractive valuation, defensive play. INCY - I already own this, but I'm considering buying more because the valuation is just too good. It's diversifying beyond its main product Jakafi, has lots of insider buybacks, low debt, outperforms sector growth, and excellent margins. B - Although I'm a bit skeptical because of gold's exceptional rise, Barrick is one of the largest and most diversified mining companies and I think other metals still have room to run (I'm especially bullish on copper). Record cash flows have improved their balance sheet, and I think the green energy transition, EVs, and increased interest in precious metals due to global instability will help.",

First in class HBM dominance and NAND . I know its trading near 52 week highs but I think forward PEG of 0.20x compared to sector median of 1.66x makes it compelling even as I am trying to diversify away from AI stocks . AMD I just fucking love Lisa Su . I think shes got a shot of rolling out HPC accelerators to give Nvidias Vera Rubin some competition . The new Instincts and EPYC CPUs are impressive as well . I know its trades at a premium but its forward PEG is roughly a 25 % discount to the sector overall . ALL Property and casualty insurance is resilient and inelastic . Near 200 % YOY growth implementing AI smartly attractive valuation defensive play . INCY I already own this but Im considering buying more because the valuation is just too good . Its diversifying beyond its main product Jakafi has lots of insider buybacks low debt outperforms sector growth and excellent margins . B Although Im a bit skeptical because of golds exceptional rise Barrick is one of the largest and most diversified mining companies and I think other metals still have room to run Im especially bullish on copper . Record cash flows have improved their balance sheet and I think the green energy transition EVs and increased interest in precious metals due to global instability will help ."

I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

      "selftext": "Meta Platforms announced a major deal to support Oklo and TerraPower, providing power for their AI data centers. We’re talking about a 1.2 GW nuclear park in Ohio. OKLO gapped up at the open, rising nearly 15% to 20% pre-market, though it pulled back during the session. As someone who successfully locked in profits pre-market today, seeing this gap up is bittersweet, but it perfectly validates the 'AI + Nuclear' investment thesis. Meta is actually providing upfront funding and prepaying for power. This transforms OKLO from a 'concept stock' into a real project with a major anchor customer and a clear 2030 roadmap. We’re seeing the whole sector rally, with Vistra (VST) up over 13% on the news. While I’m tempted to jump back in, I won’t chase a 20% gap up. I’m watching for a 'gap fill' move or consolidation around the $105 support level. RSI is definitely showing 'overbought' in the short term, but long-term institutional interest has surged. Anyone else catch this move? Are you holding for triple digits to become the new floor, or taking profits on this Meta-fueled hype?",

      "selftext": "I encouraged my mom to invest money over the next five years. Right now she is keeping everything on her bank account with no yield returns. And I told her she could get more money back than getting 2-4% from a bank, if she locks her money away for a year. My own portfolio situation is that of a complete denegerate. AMD, NVIDIA, Nebius Group and IREN Limited. Largest position is AMD by far. Bought at all time highs, so I'm in a hefty minus, but I can handle the volatility and I'm in for at least the next five years, before I start thinking about reallocations or diversification. I don't think I should invest that crazily with my moms money though. She won't invest huge sums. Maybe a 1000 Euro position and the beginning and then a monthly investment of 100 Euro. The first obvious choice for me was the S&P 500 ETF, because that one has had good returns in the last years and I believe in the US economy over the next many years. An alternative is going for a bigger gamble and picking an individual company stock. The four I had in mind were Google, Amazon, META or Broadcom: solid companies, which should continue to grow over the next 5 years and could outperform the S&P 500. And if my bet doesn't pay off, I would cut some of my own positions and give it to my mom, so that she doesn't miss out on at least +7% annually in either case - and obviously not lose any money. Any advice? Just go for the ETF and forget about it? Go with one of the individual stocks and hope for better returns? One look at my own portfolio and you can probably imagine that I would gravitate towards Broadcom. Other stocks to consider? Or a semi-conductor ETF, since I'm a fan of those? Any input is greatly appreciated.",

Here they are, from the lesser amount I need to put in to complete what I have, to the biggest: UEC: average of 6.50, 14+ last time I checked few days ago, with an ATH at 16 RYCEY: average of 8.50, now at 17+, that thing never goes down Lundin Mining: average of 12.50, now at 31+, same thing, completely booming.

      "selftext": "Vanguard's VOO seems to be the default ETF 'hold' and with good reason: it's performance has been exceptionally solid. But, when you look at Blackrock's Australian-founded, internationally-invested ETF IWLD, its upside in every respect seems to be far superior (except for management fees, which are more than offset by total cumulative returns. IWLD has generally tracked VOO very closely. Here are the differences: * Over 5 years, IWLD has, excluding dividends, returned 12.8% (higher), while VOO has returned \\~12.6% (lower) * Over 5 years, IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20% - 1.21% (higher), while VOO has paid 1.10% - 1.20% (lower) * IWLD is ESG screened, so it cuts out the most harmful stocks, while VOO has no screening other than the S&P (it hold's Chevron (fossil fuels) Phillip Morris (tobacco) etc. * VOO's fees are lower (0.03) vs IWLD's (0.2) * IWLD is more diversified, with more mid-sized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US, while VOO is very US, large-cap and tech-stock-heavy * IWLD is less US currency exposed, whereas IWLD (being internationally invested and Australian-based) has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very, very unstable When you look at the two ETFs, IWLD has grown more, returns more in dividends, costs more in fees, is more sustainable, is more diversified and is less currency exposed. On almost every metric, and in aggregate, it is a better fund. Why don't we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets?",

I first bought this stock in February 2025, when it was under $30, and gradually increased my position to 2,700 shares. This Monday, I added more, bringing my total to just over 3,300 shares. First, we have to acknowledge that KTOS is a company primarily engaged in defense and security, and in recent years, with the U.S. government increasing military spending, KTOS has seen steady growth. As a long-term investment, the potential is huge. However, recently, there’s been a lot of hype around it, attracting retail investors. But I felt something wasn’t right. I decided to liquidate all of my KTOS stock before the close. So, do you think I made the right decision?",

I first bought this stock in February 2025 when it was under $ 30 and gradually increased my position to 2700 shares . This Monday I added more bringing my total to just over 3300 shares . First we have to acknowledge that KTOS is a company primarily engaged in defense and security and in recent years with the U.S. government increasing military spending KTOS has seen steady growth . As a longterm investment the potential is huge . However recently there ’ s been a lot of hype around it attracting retail investors . But I felt something wasn ’ t right . I decided to liquidate all of my KTOS stock before the close . So do you think I made the right decision"

      "selftext": "ASML is arguably one of the most important companies in the world, with little to no competition, producing the machines required to produce the chips for companies such TSMC, Apple, etc. The main bear case a few years ago could’ve been reaching a wall after the development of their High-NA EUV manufacturing technique, but they are actively in development of Hyper-NA which is supposed to be able to create sub 1nm chip designs. You have to think that Moore’s law can only go so far and that they eventually will reach a limit to what their lithography machines can do, but at least in the near future I don’t see this company going anywhere, and they are so dominant that I don’t think another company is going to suddenly take up any of their market share. Even if they face some issues over the years, all major chip companies need them to keep making new manufacturing techniques so they can make better chips and can aid them. These companies certainly are going to want to keep refining their chips as demand has only gone up. A lot of the materials they use aren’t in short supply either such as tin and tungsten. Curious as to any opinions on why this wouldn’t be a good pick in the near-long run",

Initial concerns: * Volatility significantly higher than equity markets * Tax reporting complexity (every transaction is taxable event) * Custody risk (exchange solvency vs. self-custody operational risk) * Lack of automated investment tools comparable to traditional brokerages Implementation approach: Rather than lump-sum allocation, I structured weekly purchases to smooth volatility impact. Traditional advice suggests DCA for crypto given its cyclical nature. Execution infrastructure. Initial attempts through exchange recurring buys (Coinbase, Kraken) encountered issues: * High fees erode returns on small recurring purchases * Withdrawal restrictions complicate rebalancing * Tax reporting across multiple platforms problematic Transitioned to on-chain execution using Banana Pro. Comparable to setting up automated investment plan through brokerage - specify amount, frequency, asset allocation. Key advantages: 1) Lower transaction costs (especially on Solana) 2) Immediate custody (no exchange risk) 3) Consolidated transaction history 4) Cross-chain portfolio visibility Tax considerations: Every crypto transaction generates tax obligation. Using single platform for automated purchases simplifies cost basis tracking versus manual purchases across multiple exchanges. Results after 6 months: Portfolio behaving as expected - high volatility, but systematic approach prevents emotional decision-making during drawdowns. DCA averaging out market timing risk effectively. For those with small crypto allocation (3-10%), what systematic investment approach are you using? Still primarily through exchange recurring buys, or have you found more efficient execution methods?",

      "selftext": "Just from talking to people I know and reading what I guess would be considered 'mainstream' financial news, I've noticed that most people generally seem to think: 1. The S&P500 or any of the large equity ETF'S (QQQ, VTI, etc...) are pretty much the best bet for long term investing and will almost certainly go up over time. 2. Gold is in a short term bubble and is not a sound long term investment. Gold will almost certainly go down over time. Where do you guys fall on these opinions? Why? Thanks so much for your thoughts!",

First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

Months went by and I saw it increasing so I bought 29 more with a total of 30 ATZ stock. My average price was like $90 by then. 2 weeks ago I stupidly sold 20 of them 😭. Well today I decided to buy 34 more. Now my average price is $121. The return amount is Identical to what it was with only my 10 stocks I had earlier because the average price was lower.

Months went by and I saw it increasing so I bought 29 more with a total of 30 ATZ stock . My average price was like $ 90 by then . 2 weeks ago I stupidly sold 20 of them 😭 . Well today I decided to buy 34 more . Now my average price is $ 121 . The return amount is Identical to what it was with only my 10 stocks I had earlier because the average price was lower . I ’ m not_sure what to do here buy more or just leave it"

      "selftext": "Nvidia capped a historic 2025 by becoming the world’s most valuable company, riding explosive demand for AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang is now pushing beyond data center AI into physical world applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and AI powered assistants, aiming to embed Nvidia’s hardware and software at every layer of the next AI wave. With record revenue ($57B in a single quarter), a $500B+ order backlog through 2026, with indications from Jensen Huang that this number may actually have increased further resulting from developments since it was first announced, deep partnerships (OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens), and new chips like Vera Rubin in full production, Nvidia is positioning itself to sustain dominance even amid what many believe are overblown bubble concerns. Key risks remain geopolitical, especially China export controls although the recent developments there appear positive. Nvidia’s strategy is a deliberate shift from being the AI infrastructure supplier, which they still dominate, to becoming a de facto platform owner for machine intelligence. By tying chips, software, simulation tools, and industry partnerships together, Nvidia is reducing customer optionality. Once a carmaker, factory, or robot fleet standardizes on Nvidia’s stack, switching costs rise sharply. This makes Nvidia less exposed to an eventual slowdown in AI model training spend and more leveraged to long duration, recurring demand from autonomous systems and industrial deployment. In effect, Nvidia is anchoring itself to physical capital cycles (cars, factories, robots), which evolve more slowly but are harder to displace once embedded which should help reduce eventual true downward pressure when an AI bubble in fact makes an appearance.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR around 60k USD in total Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions also I dont really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs . this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in a few months if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . Also currently no_income but in the future Id probably do at least 50 % SP500 then rest is depends on how the market is could be more sp500 .

The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa .

      "selftext": "I’m gonna be mostly talking about ride share companies/autonomous vehicles manufacturers (uber, Lyft,Waymo ect) I’ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market. With the rise of Waymo and Tesla’s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber, Lyft, and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gonna be in this market. I’m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be. Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere. I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse. The horse was the main way of transportation, everyone owned one. Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car. Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses. This is how car ownership will be. The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver. Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it’s going to be a huge benefit to everyone. We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day. If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides. There’s no point in owning a car. It saves way more than buying a 30k car, insurance and having the liability of owning a car. Now the question is who’s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation. The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end. Think of uber now, like Netflix In the 2010s. They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming. As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing. The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate. We already saw the hbo merger drama. That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion. Tesla, Waymo, uber, Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players. I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall. They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft, while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated. This could also play out the reverse direction (seems less likely) also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers. This will ultimately leave 4-10ish players dominating consumer logistics. The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate (more likely Waymo and Tesla) and wipes everyone else out. I think it’s already too competitive of a space for this to happen. As this story progress we will see companies that haven’t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said: Overall I’m bullish, on Waymo, Tesla, uber, maybe Lyft. I don’t see a great future for ford, GM ECT Thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m gon na be mostly talking about ride share companiesautonomous vehicles manufacturers uber LyftWaymo ect I ’ ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market . With the rise of Waymo and Tesla ’ s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber Lyft and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gon na be in this market . I ’ m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be . Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere . I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse . The horse was the main way of transportation everyone owned one . Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car . Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses . This is how car ownership will be . The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver . Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it ’ s going to be a huge benefit to everyone . We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day . If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides . There ’ s no_point in owning a car . It saves way more than buying a 30k car insurance and having the liability of owning a car . Now the question is who ’ s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation . The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end . Think of uber now like Netflix In the 2010s . They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming . As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing . The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate . We already saw the hbo merger drama . That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion . Tesla Waymo uber Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players . I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall . They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated . This could also play out the reverse direction seems less likely also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers . This will ultimately leave 410ish players dominating consumer logistics . The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate more likely Waymo and Tesla and wipes everyone else out . I think it ’ s already too competitive of a space for this to happen . As this story progress we will see companies that haven ’ t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said Overall I ’ m bullish on Waymo Tesla uber maybe Lyft . I don ’ t see a great future for ford GM ECT Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hello all, Please take a look below at this plan and let me know your feedback. I appreciate you taking the time to time to read it. Context: I’m aiming to grow a $770,000 portfolio to $1,000,000 by Dec 31, 2026. I need a 29.8% total return. I’m balancing an advisor’s conservative S&P 500 anchor with my own high-conviction \"Alpha\" plays in the AI infrastructure and Nuclear sectors. Current Market Condition (Jan 9, 2026): Markets are at ATHs. S&P is testing 6,970. Geopolitical \"relief rallies\" are in full swing, but technicals look overextended. The plan: 1. The Allocation (The 50/50 Barbell) * Invested (50% - $385k): Strike-force deployment once the market hits a 1.5% pullback from today’s highs. * Cash Shield (50% - $385k): Held in SNSXX (3.42% yield) for dip-buying and risk mitigation. | Asset | Ticker | Weight | Amount | Strategy | |---|---|---|---|---| | S&P 500 | VOO | 40% | $154,000 | The Anchor (DRIP ON). | | Nasdaq 100 | QQQM | 20% | $77,000 | The Engine (DRIP ON). | | Nuclear/Uranium | NLR | 20% | $77,000 | The Power Bottleneck (DRIP OFF). | | Semiconductors | SMH | 10% | $38,500 | Sector-wide Speed (DRIP OFF). | | NVIDIA | NVDA | 5% | $19,250 | Pure GPU Alpha (DRIP OFF). | | Broadcom | AVGO | 5% | $19,250 | Custom Silicon Lead (DRIP OFF). | 2. The Rule Structure: * The Wait: No buying until VOO hits $629 or QQQM hits $254. I’m looking for 2 consecutive red days or a CPI-induced sell-off (Jan 15) to enter. * The Scalp (Aggressive): I have a $55k short-term capital loss carryover to use this year. At a 5% gain, I will harvest the profit into SNSXX. * The Runner Rule: For the satellites (NVDA, AVGO, NLR, SMH), I will replace Limit Orders with a 2% Trailing Stop once they hit +5% to capture potential parabolic moves. * The Dip Rule: I have 7 waves of $55,000 in cash. If any asset drops 5% from my strike price, I deploy one wave immediately. * The Phasing: If the market stays green, I deploy $55k into VOO/QQQM every 60 days (skipping April due to midterm election year historical soft patch). 3. Why this hits $1M in 2026 * $17.3k in risk-free SNSXX interest. * $55k in tax-neutralized scalps (thanks to the loss carryover). * $158k required from market growth. With NVDA Rubin cycle and Nuclear energy data center demand accelerating, this is the \"Physical AI\" play. Questions for the community: * Is a 2% Trailing Stop too tight for the 2026 \"vibration\" of chips? * Thoughts on skipping the April 1st phase in a midterm election year? * Am I holding too much cash ($385k) given the 29.8% return hurdle?",

At a 5 % gain I will harvest the profit into SNSXX . The Runner Rule For the satellites NVDA AVGO NLR SMH I will replace Limit Orders with a 2 % Trailing Stop once they hit 5 % to capture potential parabolic moves . The Dip Rule I have 7 waves of $ 55000 in cash . If any asset drops 5 % from my strike price I deploy one wave immediately .

      "selftext": "Mobileye to Acquire Mentee Robotics for $900M: Challenging Tesla for the Future of Labor By acquiring Mentee Robotics, Mobileye (MBLY) is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Tesla’s \"Optimus\" project. However, Mobileye is sticking to its \"Android for Cars\" philosophy selling its self-driving software and chips to other brands, **while building its own humanoid robots in-house**. Business Model: Unlike Tesla’s closed ecosystem, Mobileye will continue to provide an open platform (software/chips) for the automotive industry while developing the robot as a specialized internal product. The Technology: The robots use \"mentoring\" AI, meaning they learn tasks from a single human demonstration rather than needing massive amounts of pre-programmed data. The Two-Phase Roadmap Phase 1 (2026–2028): Industrial Labor. The first deployments will hit factories and fulfillment centers to address global labor shortages and handle repetitive physical tasks. Phase 2 (~2030): The Home. The long-term goal is a consumer-facing \"domestic helper\" capable of handling laundry, clearing tables, and providing elderly care.",

      "selftext": "First, I'm not a financial professional and this is not professional investment advice. I'm just looking broadly at the market and I'm a little concerned. Also, I'm not a VOO for lifer, but I don't hate that strategy. It seems to have worked very well in the past. \\--- The S&P 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe. The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62% of the weight, and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI. To make matters a little more concerning, several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt. Basically, I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued (especially Tesla with its ridiculous \\~300 p/e ratio) and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn. That's why I'm moving significant portions of my holdings to a **revenue-weighted** version of the S&P 500. I'm using Invesco's RWL, but there are many others that are basically the same. While their performances historically are damn near identical, revenue-weighted versions of the S&P 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower. For example, while the **top 10** of the normal S&P 500 make up nearly 40% of the fund, for RWL, the **top 24** make up around that much. Sure, it's going to be pretty similar in the long term, but in the short term, it looks like you're going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive. **Edit: I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically.** Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs, and this is no exception. The comparison is 0.03% for Vanguard and 0.39% for Invesco. While the fees are 13x higher, I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification. Because Vanguard's fee rate is so low, I personally haven't felt the difference yet, but **it is there and it is significant**. If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF, I would move to that one in a heartbeat. **Also, in the past, RWL hasn't performed better in down markets historically.** I think that an AI bubble burst would be different, however. RWL simply has less holdings in AI-forward stocks, meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower.",

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term.

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets . DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what ’ s broken so it can get fixed fast . AI is fueling their growth big time . Not_just by automating internal stuff but by driving revenue . They have 500 AInative clients already and over 5000 out of their 32000 customers are using DataDog ’ s AI tools to track generative AI applications . That ’ s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users . As more companies jump on AI DataDog becomes even more critical . Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly . All my engineer friends at work swear by it . No_contest leader in observability . Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up almost no_marketing spend and retention is insane . I ’ m holding $ DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term . Holding 6455 shares at $ 129.99 this is not_financial advice just my opinion"

      "title": "Google Just Flipped Apple. Is the Mag7 Hierarchy Changing?",
      "selftext": "This is a big deal. For the first time in years, Google's parent company Alphabet has surpassed Apple in market cap, becoming the world's second most valuable company. Is this a temporary blip or the start of a major shift in the Mag7 power rankings? My take: This is a fundamental shift. Apple's problem is that its growth is slowing. The iPhone is a mature product. The Vision Pro is cool, but it's a niche product, not a mass-market game-changer. Their revenue growth is in the low single digits. It's becoming a value stock, not a growth stock. Google, on the other hand, is an AI powerhouse. Their cloud business is growing at 25%+, and they are monetizing AI across their entire ecosystem (Search, YouTube, Android). They have a clear path to double-digit growth for the next 5 years. The market is finally waking up to this. Here's how I see the new Mag7 hierarchy: 1. Microsoft: The undisputed king. Dominant in cloud (Azure) and enterprise AI. 2. Google: The new #2. The purest AI play with a massive moat. 3. Nvidia: The essential hardware provider. The 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush. 4. Amazon: Still a beast in e-commerce and cloud, but facing more competition. 5. Apple: The new 'old tech'. A cash-flow machine, but growth is a question mark. 6. Meta: The wild card. The metaverse is a huge bet. Could be #1 or #7 in 5 years. 7. Tesla: The most volatile. Depends entirely on FSD and robotics. I'm re-weighting my portfolio based on this. I'm trimming my Apple position and adding to Google and Microsoft. I believe the market will continue to reward real AI-driven growth. I have a full valuation model for all 7 of the Mag7 stocks, comparing their growth rates, margins, and P/E ratios. It's how I made this call. Am I crazy for selling Apple? What's your ranking of the Mag7 for the next 5 years?",

Is this a temporary blip or the start of a major shift in the Mag7 power rankings My take This is a fundamental shift . Apples problem is that its growth is slowing . The iPhone is a mature product . The Vision Pro is cool but its a niche product not_a massmarket gamechanger . Their revenue growth is in the low single digits . Its becoming a value stock not_a growth stock . Google on the other hand is an AI powerhouse . Their cloud business is growing at 25 % and they are monetizing AI across their entire ecosystem Search YouTube Android . They have a clear path to doubledigit growth for the next 5 years . The market is finally waking up to this . Heres how I see the new Mag7 hierarchy 1 . Microsoft The undisputed king . Dominant in cloud Azure and enterprise AI . 2 . Google The new 2 . The purest AI play with a massive moat . 3 . Nvidia The essential hardware provider . The picks and shovels of the AI gold rush . 4 . Amazon Still a beast in ecommerce and cloud but facing more competition . 5 . Apple The new old tech . A cashflow machine but growth is a question mark . 6 . Meta The wild card . The metaverse is a huge bet . Could be 1 or 7 in 5 years . 7 . Tesla The most volatile . Depends entirely on FSD and robotics . Im reweighting my portfolio based on this . Im trimming my Apple position and adding to Google and Microsoft . I believe the market will continue to reward real AIdriven growth . I have a full valuation model for all 7 of the Mag7 stocks comparing their growth rates margins and PE ratios . Its how I made this call . Am I crazy for selling Apple Whats your ranking of the Mag7 for the next 5 years"

But looking at the data for 2026, I'm seeing something different: What's changing: • Emerging markets returned 34.4% in 2025 (outperforming US) • Energy stocks are rallying (JP Morgan estimates US oil potential) • Value stocks are starting to outperform growth • Housing prices are DOWN for the first time in 2+ years • Retail spending is showing signs of fatigue This feels like the beginning of a real market rotation, not just a dip What I'm realizing: The easy money in 2025 was in mega-cap tech. But 2026 might reward investors who are willing to diversify: • Energy (oil prices forecast to average $61/barrel) • Emerging markets (already up 34.4% in 2025) • Real estate (prices down, potentially a buying opportunity) • Retail (some names like ULTA, AEO, GAP are showing strength) I'm not saying sell everything. But I am saying that the playbook from 2025 (just buy Nvidia) might not work in 2026. Am I crazy for thinking this? Or are you seeing the same signs?",

      "selftext": "Bottom Line Up Front: Counterpart AI doesn’t replace doctors, it helps Medical Doctors, Registered Nurses, and pharmacists act earlier so patients stay home and hospitals stay emty. Disclaimer: This post was written with the assistance of ChatGPT for general discussion only and is not medical, financial, or professional advice. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ How Counterpart AI (Clover AI) is supposed to work. Example patient: 72-year-old with diabetes (DM) and heart failure (CHF) (Step 1): Risk identification The system reviews existing data like: • Medical records (EHR) • Medication history and refills • Prior ER or hospital visits Based on patterns, the patient is flagged as higher risk for a future hospitalization. (Step 2): In-visit prompt During a regular appointment, the doctor may see a short note such as: “Heart failure (CHF) risk trending upward consider labs, medication review, and adherence check.” Nothing replaces clinical judgment. It’s more of a reminder than an alert. (Step 3): Care team follow-up If needed: • The medical doctor adjusts medications • A registered nurse handles follow-ups • A registered pharmacist helps simplify meds or check adherence The idea is that everyone focuses on the same high-risk patients instead of spreading effort evenly. (Step 4): Prevention By catching issues earlier: • Some ER visits may be avoided • Fewer hospital admissions • Better continuity of care Lower costs are a side effect, not the main action. (Why) Why clinicians might actually use something like this • Less time digging through charts • Clearer prioritization of patients • Works within existing workflows In value-based care models, incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume. Big picture: When risk is identified earlier, care teams have a better chance to intervene sooner, potentially avoiding some hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes.",

I’ve done my research, and with the way the market is shifting, I think OKLO could be positioned for some strong upside.

      "selftext": "Here's some of [our report]( The GEO Group and CoreCivic, the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE, seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year’s inauguration of President Donald Trump. But while Trump’s deportation machine had explosive growth, its reach hasn’t lived up to Wall Street expectations. Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected. Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system, and privately run holding facilities, expected to grow even larger. “Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up.” On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes. At the beginning of 2025, contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group seemed particularly well-suited. “This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February. By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement. Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America. “Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst. [Read more]( (no paywall or ads)",

      "selftext_processed": "Heres some of our report The GEO Group and CoreCivic the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year ’ s inauguration of President Donald Trump . But while Trump ’ s deportation machine had explosive growth its reach hasn ’ t lived up to Wall Street expectations . Stock prices for both companies slumped . Despite a series of immigration blitzes and highprofile raids the government didn ’ t use as much detention space as investors expected . Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year with the immigration system and privately run holding facilities expected to grow even larger . “ Once Trump was elected there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger ” said Joe Gomes an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets an investment bank . “ It ’ s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up. ” On his first day in office Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention . Days later the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law the Laken Riley Act made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of lowlevel crimes . At the beginning of 2025 contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty ready to be reactivated . GEO Group seemed particularly wellsuited . “ This is a unique moment in our company ’ s history and we believe we are wellpositioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing transportation electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders ” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February . By summer Trump ’ s “ One Big Beautiful Bill Act ” was signed into law approving $ 170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement . Oddly enough the price of GEO Group ’ s stock which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day then plummeted . At the end of 2025 GEO Group ’ s stock was trading around $ 16 per share down from a high of $ 36.46 on Trump ’ s second day in office . Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America . “ Investors got over their skis ” said Gomes the analyst . Read more no paywall or ads"

      "selftext": "The consensus forecast for 2026 is: GDP growth of 2.5-3%, continued Fed rate cuts, and a \"soft landing\" for the economy.But here's what I think the consensus is missing: Tariff Uncertainty: Trump's tariff policies are a wildcard. If tariffs escalate, inflation could re-caccelerate, forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts. This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama: The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026. If there's a standoff, it could create a mini-crisis. Markets hate uncertainty. Valuation Risk: The S&P 500 is trading at 205% above its long-term trend. That's a historic extreme. While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, mean reversion is a mathematical certainty. The question is when. Geopolitical Escalation: With Trump's aggressive foreign policy (Venezuela, Greenland, etc.), geopolitical risk is elevated. A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction. So, while the consensus is optimistic, I'm cautious. I'm positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025, with potential for a 10-15% correction at some point. What's your base case for 2026? Are you optimistic or cautious? Disclaimer: This is a macro outlook for discussion. If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me, DM me, I will be happy to discuss with everyone",

      "selftext": "Early on, I assumed that better investing meant being smarter, faster, or more informed than the average person. Over time, especially after sitting through periods of volatility and uncertainty, that assumption slowly broke down. What actually seemed to matter more was patience: staying invested, not reacting to every headline, and accepting that doing nothing is often the hardest part of the process. Intelligence helps, but patience appears to compound in a different way I’m curious when this realization happened for others. Was it after a specific market event, a personal mistake, or simply enough years in the market to see patterns repeat ?",

      "selftext": "Hello all. I'm trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online. Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info. I'm mostly an invest-and-forget kind of investor, but do play with options a little just for fun (options buy would typically be less than 0.1% of my total investments). For my options \"play\" I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade, which I've had for a couple of decades at least. In ETrade I could sell a position (stock or options) and immediately use that money to buy something else. I moved that account to Schwab (much more modern interface and some nice research tools), and found out I can't do that - I can't spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles. WTF? Is that really a common thing? I'm fairly certain I can sell/buy immediately in my Vanguard account too, but I don't trade actively enough to really say for sure - mostly mutual funds there, so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway. I just never realized, I guess. I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab, then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no interest (if it happens same-day). This was stated in a reddit comment by someone, but I can't find that info in any Schwab documents, so I'm not sure how much to trust it. I didn't set up margin on that account, because I don't want to actually borrow to invest, but maybe ETrade really worked through margin, and I just didn't know? A little more backstory, and I'm hoping I didn't make a rash move: I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation, as right now I've got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies. I'm stuck with two of those (employer-driven), one of which is Fidelity, and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity. ETrade keeps getting moved/bought, and doesn't keep their interface very up-to-date so it just feels old and clunky (and sometimes just doesn't work, although that seems to have been improving lately). Plus, simplifying by having fewer companies would be good. Unfortunately, Fidelity customer service really pissed me off, and they were utterly incompetent - I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved - online didn't work, talking to customer service didn't work, they put in a tech support ticket, and that didn't work, they sent me paper forms but then I'd need to find a place to print and sign... it was a mess. Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes, including the account transfer request, which settled in less than a week. Yay! No simplification for me, however (one company swapped out for another new one, albeit one with a nicer trading platform), and I probably didn't investigate carefully enough -- I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service, which is a bad reason to make a decision. Vanguard would have been easy, but if I move retirement accounts there (possible) I'd have 99% of my assets with one company, which I'm trying to avoid. And their trading platform is terrible. Ugh. It shouldn't be this complicated....",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello all . Im trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online . Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info . Im mostly an investandforget kind of investor but do play with options a little just for fun options buy would typically be less than 0.1 % of my total investments . For my options play I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade which Ive had for a couple of decades at least . In ETrade I could sell a position stock or options and immediately use that money to buy something else . I moved that account to Schwab much more modern interface and some nice research tools and found out I cant do that I cant spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles . WTF Is that really a common thing Im fairly certain I can sellbuy immediately in my Vanguard account too but I dont trade actively enough to really say for sure mostly mutual funds there so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway . I just never_realized I guess . I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no_interest if it happens sameday . This was stated in a reddit comment by someone but I cant find that info in any Schwab documents so Im not_sure how much to trust it . I didnt set up margin on that account because I dont want to actually borrow to invest but maybe ETrade really worked through margin and I just didnt know A little more backstory and Im hoping I didnt make a rash move I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation as right now Ive got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies . Im stuck with two of those employerdriven one of which is Fidelity and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity . ETrade keeps getting movedbought and doesnt keep their interface very uptodate so it just feels old and clunky and sometimes just doesnt work although that seems to have been improving lately . Plus simplifying by having fewer companies would be good . Unfortunately Fidelity customer service really pissed me off and they were utterly incompetent I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved online didnt work talking to customer service didnt work they put in a tech support ticket and that didnt work they sent me paper forms but then Id need to find a place to print and sign ... it was a mess . Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes including the account transfer request which settled in less than a week . Yay No_simplification for me however one company swapped out for another new one albeit one with a nicer trading platform and I probably didnt investigate carefully enough I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service which is a bad reason to make a decision . Vanguard would have been easy but if I move retirement accounts there possible Id have 99 % of my assets with one company which Im trying to avoid . And their trading platform is terrible . Ugh . It shouldnt be this complicated ...."

      "selftext": "I’m 22 years old and just transitioned from an internship to a full-time Software Engineer role making $85k a year in a low tax state. I currently have $12.3k in a brokerage account invested entirely in FXAIX, and I’ve been contributing $100 per week to that account. For my retirement strategy, I have set up my 401k with a 6% pre-tax contribution and a 3% Roth contribution, though I need to be with the company for a full year before they start their 50% match on the first 6%. My immediate goal is to max out my Roth IRA for the 2025 tax year before the April deadline and start on 2026 as well. I’m looking for advice on whether I should stay the course with the long-term index fund approach or if it makes sense to be more aggressive and \"play\" with a portion of my money given my age and career path. I’m also wondering if I should prioritize increasing my 401k contributions further or if I should focus entirely on the Roth IRA and tax advantaged accounts before putting more into my taxable brokerage. I’m open to any feedback and advice! Thanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "I am a U.S. citizen living in Germany. This is nice for many reasons, but causes some real headaches for investment. Long story short, normal U.S. brokers won't let me buy ETFs etc. without a US address, and if I buy the same in Germany I will be double-taxed into oblivion. The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live, and disincentives for \"passive foreign income\" screw expats over. However, buying individual stocks and bonds is not \"passive\" and therefore avoids the double taxation problem. I understand this as a loser's game and would vastly prefer the buy-and-forget index fund approach, but that's not an option for me. So my questions: * Is it possible to \"simulate\" an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds? Or would this take a life-consuming amount of effort to do without massive risk? * Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bond-like accounts (Raisin etc.)? * Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken? **TLDR** I'm hoping to approximate as closely as I can the \"normal\" investing approach that a working person in the USA would take, but I have to do so without \"passive\" index funds.",

Long story short normal U.S. brokers wont let me buy ETFs etc . without a US address and if I buy the same in Germany I will be doubletaxed into oblivion . The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live and disincentives for passive foreign income screw expats over . However buying individual stocks and bonds is not_passive and therefore avoids the double taxation problem . I understand this as a losers game and would vastly prefer the buyandforget index fund approach but thats not_an option for me . So my questions Is it possible to simulate an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds Or would this take a lifeconsuming amount of effort to do without massive risk Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bondlike accounts Raisin etc . Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken TLDR Im hoping to approximate as closely as I can the normal investing approach that a working person in the USA would take but I have to do so without passive index funds ."

My main motivation was exposure to consumer credit without being fully correlated with equity markets. What I learned pretty quickly is that P2P is not “passive income” in the true sense. You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes. On the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns. Today I keep P2P as a single-digit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding. I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure of you are using it.",

My main motivation was exposure to consumer credit without being fully correlated with equity markets . What I learned pretty quickly is that P2P is not_ “ passive income ” in the true sense . You still need to watch loan originators understand how buyback works and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes . On the positive side cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface . On the negative side platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns . Today I keep P2P as a singledigit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding . I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure of you are using it ."

      "title": "Meta strikes nuclear power agreements with three companies",
      "selftext": "Source: [ WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Friday it struck 20-year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and ​develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors. Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20%, ‌whereas Vistra rose about 8% in premarket trade. Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure long-term electricity supplies as [artificial ‌intelligence]( and data centers increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades. The company said in a blog it will purchase power from Vistra's Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and lengthen the lifespan ⁠of the plants, which are licensed ‌to run through at least 2036 with one of two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047. Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by ‍Oklo and TerraPower, the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates. SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on site. Critics say they will ​struggle to achieve economies of scale similar to current large reactors. There are no U.S. SMRs ‌in commercial operations yet and the plants will require permits. Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said the plans along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years will \"make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.\" The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035, Meta said. The size ⁠of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 ​GW. In 2024 Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers ​for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power. Meta will help fund TerraPower's development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. ‍The agreement also provides ⁠Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035. TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support rapid deployment of reactors. Meta said its ⁠partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030. The support ‌will help \"early procurement and development\", said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source WASHINGTON Jan 9 Reuters Meta Platforms said on Friday it struck 20year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and ​develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors . Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20 % ‌whereas Vistra rose about 8 % in premarket trade . Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure longterm electricity supplies as artificial ‌intelligence and data centers increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades . The company said in a blog it will purchase power from Vistras Perry and DavisBesse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania . Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and lengthen the lifespan ⁠of the plants which are licensed ‌to run through at least 2036 with one of two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047 . Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by ‍Oklo and TerraPower the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates . SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on site . Critics say they will ​struggle to achieve economies of scale similar to current large reactors . There are no_U.S . SMRs ‌in commercial operations yet and the plants will require permits . Joel Kaplan Metas chief global affairs officer said the plans along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years will make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history . The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035 Meta said . The size ⁠of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 ​GW . In 2024 Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers ​for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power . Meta will help fund TerraPowers development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032 . ‍The agreement also provides ⁠Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035 . TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support rapid deployment of reactors . Meta said its ⁠partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030 . The support ‌will help early procurement and development said Jacob DeWitte Oklo ’ s cofounder and CEO ."

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

      "title": "US Supreme Court tariff decision likely today",
      "selftext": "All eyes are on the US Supreme Court today for its ruling on US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against the trade partners of the country. The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, as it has scheduled January 9 as an “opinion day”- the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue. Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on opinion days. The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without Congress's approval. Practical and economic implications : The stakes of the Supreme Court’s decision extend far beyond legal theory. The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships. If the Court invalidates these tariffs, many companies will likely seek refunds, creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government. Moreover, the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations, as the threat of swift, sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table. Notably, certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court’s decision. These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives, albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools. The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $1,100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $1,400 this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank. It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $300 in 2025 and $400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away. The court's decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trump's tariffs. It could, for example, narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, Morgan Stanley's policy strategists wrote earlier this week. It could also give the administration a \"grace period\" to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place. And even if tariffs are fully scaled back, the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels. \"Among other variables, timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios,\" Morgan Stanley wrote.",

      "selftext_processed": "All eyes are on the US Supreme Court today for its ruling on US President Donald Trump ’ s tariffs against the trade partners of the country . The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday as it has scheduled January 9 as an “ opinion day ” the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs . The court does not_announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue . Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 1000 a.m. Eastern Time ET on opinion days . The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act IEEPA to impose tariffs without Congresss approval . Practical and economic implications The stakes of the Supreme Court ’ s decision extend far beyond legal theory . The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships . If the Court invalidates these tariffs many companies will likely seek refunds creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government . Moreover the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations as the threat of swift sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table . Notably certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court ’ s decision . These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools . The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $ 1100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $ 1400 this year according to the Tax Foundation a think tank . It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $ 300 in 2025 and $ 400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away . The courts decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trumps tariffs . It could for example narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit Morgan Stanleys policy strategists wrote earlier this week . It could also give the administration a grace period to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place . And even if tariffs are fully scaled back the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels . Among other variables timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios Morgan Stanley wrote ."

In terms of performance . Yes beat spx every year i was in . Please dont suggest holding etfs instead of stocks . This is a stock sub . Do your homework .

      "selftext": "Nvidia is requiring full upfront, non-refundable payment from Chinese customers for its H200 AI chips. Chinese regulators have temporarily asked some firms to pause H200 orders while deciding how many domestic chips must be purchased alongside each Nvidia chip. Chinese demand exceeds supply (orders >2M units vs. \\\\\\~700k available), despite domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend which lag behind the H200 in performance. The policy shifts financial and regulatory risk from Nvidia to Chinese buyers, reflecting Nvidia’s caution after prior losses from sudden export bans. Nvidia is ramping production but capacity expansion is constrained by generational chip transitions and competition for foundry capacity. Nvidia’s payment terms effectively offload geopolitical and regulatory risk onto Chinese customers, protecting cash flow and avoiding inventory write downs. Beijing’s actions toward H200 imports signals a deliberate attempt to subsidize and force adoption of local products while still selectively accessing top tier Nvidia technology. Allowing H200s for commercial use while excluding military, SOEs, and critical infrastructure reflects a is Beijing’s way of balancing AI competitiveness with national security. Strong dependency on Nvidia persists despite heavy investment in domestic chips, Chinese tech giants’ willingness to prepay underscores continued reliance on Nvidia for cutting edge AI training. Rapid reversals in U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures suggest that capital discipline and flexible supply allocation are now core competitive advantages for Nvidia. Full prepayment, high unit prices, and excess demand indicate Nvidia retains exceptional pricing power, even in politically constrained markets which is something few hardware firms can sustain. Nvidia is monetizing Chinese demand while insulating itself from policy whiplash, and China is using regulatory approval to extract industrial policy concessions leaving buyers to absorb the uncertainty in exchange for access to best in class AI compute.",

      "selftext": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT (IIPR, preferred stock IIPR.PRA)? IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and, in simple terms, targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies. Marijuana companies - although a good chunk of states have legalized - are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium, on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space. IIPR has always been profitable and never missed a dividend. Based on their most recent 10Q filing, they have $2.3 billion in assets - mainly the land and facilities they own - to about $340 million in debt. Recently, their income has gone down as - with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity - they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16% of their revenue over the past year. But, even with that hit, their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs. Accordingly, from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $1.8 billion; and, in general, even if all premiums for their rent went away - i.e., their revenues got cut in 1/3 - they would still be profitable. IIPR's common stock is trading down and has a 15% yield right now, which is priced like it will get cut. But, their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal. It has a 9.5% dividend yield - which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends - and is trading at about 5% below par value. Additionally, the preferred stock value issued is only $44 million. With an approximately $1.8 billion equity cushion, it seems like the $44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected. And, to top it off you're getting a 9.5% yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time. But, even if it did get called, because it's currently trading 5% below call value, even then you would still get a return. **Summary**: IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under. You get 9% yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but, even then, you would still get a 5% immediate return on being called.",

      "selftext_processed": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT IIPR preferred stock IIPR.PRA IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and in simple terms targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies . Marijuana companies although a good chunk of states have legalized are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space . IIPR has always been profitable and never_missed a dividend . Based on their most recent 10Q filing they have $ 2.3 billion in assets mainly the land and facilities they own to about $ 340 million in debt . Recently their income has gone down as with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16 % of their revenue over the past year . But even with that hit their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs . Accordingly from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $ 1.8 billion and in general even if all premiums for their rent went away i.e . their revenues got cut in 13 they would still be profitable . IIPRs common stock is trading down and has a 15 % yield right now which is priced like it will get cut . But their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal . It has a 9.5 % dividend yield which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends and is trading at about 5 % below par value . Additionally the preferred stock value issued is only $ 44 million . With an approximately $ 1.8 billion equity cushion it seems like the $ 44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected . And to top it off youre getting a 9.5 % yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time . But even if it did get called because its currently trading 5 % below call value even then you would still get a return . Summary IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under . You get 9 % yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but even then you would still get a 5 % immediate return on being called ."

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

      "selftext_processed": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation . The company is executing a rollup strategy in building products distribution an extremely large fragmented and underdigitized industry . The investment case is less about shortterm housing cycles and more about disciplined MA operational improvement and longterm compounding . QXO operates in building materials distribution with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products . It supplies contractors with products such as shingles insulation siding waterproofing and related materials . Key characteristics of the industry $ 800B total addressable market Highly fragmented dominated by regional operators Low digital penetration Logisticsintensive and relationshipdriven Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital systems and operational discipline . The core of the thesis is management . Brad Jacobs has built multiple largescale industrial platforms United Waste sold for $ 2.5B United Rentals URI became the largest equipment rental company globally XPO Logistics 30x return later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses Jacobs followed a consistent playbook 1 . Enter fragmented industries 2 . Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3 . Standardize operations 4 . Invest heavily in technology 5 . Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."

USAA decided to get out of that market and transferred everything over to Charles Schwab. I got annoyed and opened a new Roth IRA directly with Vanguard and pretty much forgot about the first one. I have only been contributing to the new account since. I got a statement in the mail and it turns out compound interest works and I find I have about $76k in this orphan Charles Schwab account. I’d like to move that money over to my Vanguard Roth without paying any penalties. Anyone have any idea how I should go about it?",

USAA decided to get out of that market and transferred everything over to Charles Schwab . I got annoyed and opened a new Roth IRA directly with Vanguard and pretty much forgot about the first one . I have only been contributing to the new account since . I got a statement in the mail and it turns out compound interest works and I find I have about $ 76k in this orphan Charles Schwab account . I ’ d like to move that money over to my Vanguard Roth without paying any penalties . Anyone have any idea how I should go about it"

It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for clarity. Trump claimed in the post that the move would help restore “affordability,” a word that has become key to Democrats’ political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.

      "selftext": "Hi all, My family has an antiquated tradition of gifting savings bonds to young relatives that I'd like to continue. I know that they're not a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there, but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool, one that stuck with me through the years. I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder, and I'm hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not a gift card. As the US Treasury Department no longer issues paper savings bonds, I'm exploring options from non-US countries. (I really do like the physical paper bond certificate, although it looks to be harder to find these days. Canada made a similar transition.) My base requirements in order (only the first one is absolutely required): \\-Legally purchasable by US citizen with no foreign residencies or dual citizenship \\-Minimum purchase amount $100 - $200 USD (open to going higher if needed, but I'd prefer smaller denominations) \\-Paper bonds issued if possible, electronic is fine but I'm sentimental. \\-Generally stable government in decent financial health, although my risk / reward tolerance is pretty high. Open to developing countries. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I recognize that this tradition is antiquated, but I think it's sweet and nostalgic. Thanks for taking a look.",

I already have an emergency fund and I’m looking to invest for the long term, focusing more on safety and consistency than on short-term gains.

I’m not sure whether it makes sense to split the investment between different ETFs, or how to think about allocation in general. Should I focus mainly on broad market exposure, or does it make sense to set aside a small percentage for something a bit riskier with higher long-term growth potential? I’d really appreciate hearing different perspectives. Investing isn’t something my parents are familiar with (or particularly supportive of), so I’m trying to learn and make a sensible decision on my own.

After a very jagged advance to $160 by 2017, the stock was destroyed during the pandemic, falling all the way to 41 by early 2020. The shares recovered, reaching $218 by early 2022. EXPE was then smashed again, declining to $82 by late 2022. From its 2022 peak until February 2025, the stock traced out a large cup formation and then a handle. The shares broke out of this bullish pattern in August, peaking on September 15. What’s interesting: On November 7, EXPE gapped higher on huge volume, peaked a few days later, pulled back to its 10-week exponential, and then bounced again. PE is at 27 currently Currently net positive Latest insider buying (Expedia executive(s)rule 16b-3 , Scott f schenkel 12/15 30507 shares currently at a nav 4.67% gain . Current 6 month change + 68.77 % You could put a stop-loss just under chart and moving-average support at $274. With no overhead resistance, profits at $320.

Now my portfolio's looking juicier than a Cybertruck's design (controversial but profitable, lol). Bought in 2023, rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went \"💎🙌\" mode. Now? Let's just say my gains are giving main character energy. Elon might send rockets to Mars, but my bank account's already on the moon! Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing and let the chaos work its magic. P.S. If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot, my shares would probably moon so hard we'd need a new emoji. 🚀🌕",

Now my portfolios looking juicier than a Cybertrucks design controversial but profitable lol . Bought in 2023 rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went 💎🙌 mode . Now Lets just say my gains are giving main character energy . Elon might send rockets to Mars but my bank accounts already on the moon Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing_and let the chaos work its magic . P.S . If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot my shares would probably moon so hard wed need a new emoji . 🚀🌕"

I am 5-10 years from retirement and still interested in growth (not interested in moving to bonds etc). I need to move about 200K into other investments within my 401K, not all at once obviously. When I buy a stock or an ETF, I know the price at that moment. With a mutual fund I have no idea until the close and then it is too late to get that days price. I am not trying to time but it would annoy me to lose money based on trading today instead of tomorrow or the next day and it will add up. How can I guesstimate the price of a mutual fund at 2:30PM during the trading day (investment directives have to be in before 3PM).",

After the just first week of 2026 Target has rallied over 5% after dropping 31% in 2025, following the backlash surrounding its rollback of DEI initiatives. I’ve been a believer in Target for a while and have been consistently buying shares since October. But my faith in Target is mostly speculative, and I’m making to post to get some thoughts on more formal aspects of Target’s business. My continued faith in the company stems mainly from the fact that girls have always loved Target. Yes this did contribute to a decline in sales as their adherence to Trump’s anti-DEI policies drove away more progressive consumers, which in large part were young women who’ve been one of Target’s primary demographics. But from what I’ve observed, the backlash was more performative than anything, as even in early fall, a lot of girls I knew still saw Target as their preferred retailer (whether it’s for the store aesthetic or products I’m not sure). What did worry me though was Ulta beauty announcing that they were ending their long term partnership with Target, but from what I’ve observed even that doesn’t seem to be a big issue as girls still love stopping by Target and browsing their selection of beauty products.",

I’ve been putting in 400 SGD per month (slightly over 300 USD) and intends of setting a recurring buy every 2 weeks. Right now, this is my plan for the allocation: \\- VOO: 50%, 75 USD every 2 weeks \\- QQQM: 20%, 30 USD every 2 weeks \\- VXUS: 30%, 45 USD every 2 weeks Total: 150 USD every 2 weeks Few questions: 1) Does the allocation make sense? 2) If I intend to venture into healthcare, should I also leave a % of my portfolio for VHT? If so, how much? (I’ve been buying VHT when there’s a dip, but not sure if I should DCA on this as well) Would appreciate any advice from seniors. 🙏",

      "selftext": "Source - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, significantly higher than the $901 billion approved by Congress for 2026, boosting defense stocks, but sparking skepticism among budget experts. Any such increase in the military budget would require congressional authorization, which could pose a challenge, although Trump's Republicans, who hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have shown little appetite for objecting to Trump's spending plans. Trump said in a Truth Social post that he made the decision on 2027 military spending \"after long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives... especially in these very troubled and dangerous times.\" In just the last few days, U.S. forces seized Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro from his country, toppling him from power. The White House has also said that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military. Trump has also deployed U.S. troops to police a number of cities across the country. The news followed a separate Truth Social post from Trump blasting defense companies for producing weapons too slowly. In it he pledged to block defense contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they accelerated production. Trump said the extra spending would be covered by revenues generated by tariffs he has imposed on nearly every country and many industrial sectors, and the U.S. would still be able to reduce its debt and send dividend checks to \"moderate income\" Americans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the proposal would cost $5 trillion through 2035, while adding $5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest. It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now, noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $288 billion in 2025, well below Trump's own estimates, which have fluctuated around $600 billion in recent days.",

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget a nonpartisan think tank estimated the proposal would cost $ 5 trillion through 2035 while adding $ 5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest . It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal . The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $ 288 billion in 2025 well below Trumps own estimates which have fluctuated around $ 600 billion in recent days ."

      "selftext": "I've recently studied a system used by seasoned traders that effectively transforms T+1 trading into near T+0 trading. Its logic is simple yet powerful: entering during the final 30 minutes of the trading day (the closing period) grants a “first-mover advantage” at the next day's opening. When quantitative funds boost liquidity in the early session, you avoid chasing rallies by instead providing exit liquidity (taking profits). This “six-step stock selection framework” targets mid-cap momentum stocks with specific characteristics: Golden Range: Up 3%-5% by 2:30 PM (indicating strong momentum without overextension). Strong Uptrend: Over 10% gain in the past 30 days. Size & Liquidity: Capped market cap for flexibility, volume ratio > 1. Volume Ratio Filter: Between 5% and 10% to confirm genuine buyer interest, not institutional dumping. Speed is determined by technique; mindset determines long-term success. I've been backtesting this approach and documenting specific signals. I've compiled a simplified pattern analysis and recent case studies. If you'd like to discuss these setups or understand the logic behind the filters, leave a comment and I'll respond.",

      "selftext": "Google is adding Gemini AI features to Gmail, which now has more than 3 billion users. Some of the AI features will be turned on by default in inboxes, so users will have to opt out if they don’t want them. The company said Gmail will now be able to better summarize emails and suggest responses. Last year, Google’s Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses. One of the new features is “Suggested Replies,” which Google says uses the context of a user’s emails to create one-click responses. It’s an update to a prior tool called “Smart Replies.” The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise. Driven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it’s valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to get your opinions on my current PEA (French equity savings plan) allocation and my long-term investment strategy. For context: I'm 22 years old, still a student, and I invest with a very long-term perspective (15-20 years minimum). I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) on a monthly basis. Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan (PEA): * AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF (DCAM): **38%** * AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF (PAASI): **14%** * BNP Paribas S&P 500 ETF (ESD): **30%** * BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF (ETZ): **18%** So I only hold ETFs, no individual stocks at the moment. I would like your feedback on several points: * What do you think of this overall allocation? * Do you think any ETFs are over- or underweighted? * Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region? * Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation? I'm considering adding a more sector-specific ETF, for example, one focused on armaments/defense, but I'm not sure if it's a good long-term strategy or if it would provide real diversification. Another point: Do you think it's better to remain 100% invested in ETFs, or to add some direct stock investments in the future? Finally, an important point: This post is intended for an international subreddit, and my French equity savings plan (PEA) limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs, such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold. Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism.",

For context Im 22 years old still a student and I invest with a very longterm perspective 1520 years minimum . I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollarcost averaging DCA on a monthly basis . Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan PEA AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF DCAM 38 % AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF PAASI 14 % BNP Paribas SP 500 ETF ESD 30 % BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF ETZ 18 % So I only hold ETFs no_individual stocks at the moment . I would like your feedback on several points What do you think of this overall allocation Do you think any ETFs are over or underweighted Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation Im considering adding a more sectorspecific ETF for example one focused on armamentsdefense but Im not_sure if its a good longterm strategy or if it would provide real diversification . Another point Do you think its better to remain 100 % invested in ETFs or to add some direct stock investments in the future Finally an important point This post is intended for an international subreddit and my French equity savings plan PEA limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs such as the SP 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold . Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism ."

Novo already has the lead with its oral Wegovy and that has been a big part of why their stock has stayed so strong lately. Lilly clearly does not want to be left behind and is pushing hard into pill based options too. If Nimbus and Lilly manage to bring something effective to market, it could start shifting attention and money between these companies. Curious to see how this plays out for Novo long term since they have had such a big head start.",

      "selftext": "Background: I’m 29 years old and currently have about $125k invested across TSP, Roth IRA, and a brokerage. About 20k in debt that I’m paying off (credit card with locked low rate due to SCRA)Very stable job making about 100k p/y My current approach is long-term investing with a heavy focus on growth, and I’m comfortable riding out market ups and downs. I’ve been looking at VOO vs VOOG and trying to think through the tradeoffs. I like the idea of focusing more on growth, but I also understand the benefit of just sticking with a broad S&P 500 fund and keeping expense ratios low. I guess what I’m really asking is: What are the pros/cons of investing in VOO vs VOOG when you have the time to ride the ups and downs? With VOOG being more tech-heavy, does the current AI money being concentrated in a handful of companies make it more unstable looking forward? Are there any big differences tax-wise between holding one vs the other in tax-advantaged accounts (Roth/TSP) vs a taxable brokerage? Does it make more sense to just pick one, or run some mix of the two? Curious what others think, especially anyone who’s held VOOG through different market cycles.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace so new AI usage does not require a new habit, a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up.\" \\----- But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else. Gemini has offered 1 year of free\\* subscription to Pro for Indian users. And it's one of the largest markets. So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that. So, it may not be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace. It's simply due to free subscriptions. In that case, there's a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends, given how price sensitive Indians are.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search Chrome Android Workspace so new AI usage does not_require a new habit a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up . But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else . Gemini has offered 1 year of free subscription to Pro for Indian users . And its one of the largest markets . So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that . So it may not_be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search Chrome Android Workspace . Its simply due to free subscriptions . In that case theres a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends given how price sensitive Indians are ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my next play: I am buying $30 calls expiring 1/30 for $SOFI. This play is a reversal/earnings play. SOFI has reached a bottom at the $26 range, and has since bounced to 26.98, where it closed. Here is my thesis: First off, SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking, loans, investing, and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage, borrow, and grow their money. I am bullish for a few reasons: SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters. For example, they added roughly 850k members, bringing the total membership to 11-12 million. SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no longer being just a lender; it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms. SOFI is also adding alternative private-market funds and AI tools to their platform. Now on the financial side of things: SOFI’s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year. Q1 revenue- $772M Q2 revenue- $855M Q3 revenue- $950M Q1 GAAP- $71M Q2 GAAP- $97M Q3 GAAP- $139.4M As you can see, both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year, which is bullish. Management has raised guidance, including forecasts for higher revenue, earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Note: SOFI is down because they had a share offering, big names like Goldman Sachs, BOA, and Citigroup bought. Therefore, smart money is getting in right now. In conclusion, I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes. SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26, showing that it has found support. SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month, so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings.",

SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings ."

We make around $10,000-$11,000 a month and have $30,000 sitting in our savings account from selling our first house rn. I receive a 2% raise every year and a few major bumps here and there to account for the market in my career, while her business is steadily growing more and more (she makes almost double what I do). We plan on doubling our mortgage every month towards the principal with an extra $1,821, then use an extra $2,000 a month to invest, and use the rest on wants like renovating our house, traveling, ect and throwing whatever is left for the month in a HYSA. The goal is the hopefully retire within the next 20 years and living off of our investments and my wife’s business while she takes a back seat and lets her employees bring us income (she co-owns a dog grooming and boarding business but just hired 2 more groomers) and slowly move a percentage of our investments into bonds as we get closer to retirement. I’m still in the beginning stages of my research on investing but basically my question is, would just investing the $2,000 into VOO and VTI right now be good for our situation and goals?",

      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections . If he wins the protections are gone the Naira tumbles . If he wins but Tinubu steals it from him again markets send the naira tumbling anyway ."

      "selftext": "When I first started investing, I spent a lot of time overanalyzing small decisions. Every allocation tweak felt important, every market move needed an explanation. Over time, especially after living through a few volatile periods, I noticed that the biggest improvement didn’t come from better analysis, but from doing less. Simplifying the process, checking prices less often, and accepting that uncertainty is part of the game made investing feel calmer and more sustainable. I’m curious what helped others reach that point. Was it experience, a bad mistake, automation, or simply time in the market?",

      "selftext": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal. These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand, creating a high-probability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early. A typical capitulation involves a rapid, steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out. This is usually confirmed by a volume spike, showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once. Price structure plays a critical role. Key levels like major support zones, trendline holds, or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in. Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal. Risk management is essential tight stop-loss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside. For early entries, it’s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce, bullish candlestick formation, or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in. Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto. For example, when a stock drops 15% in two days, hits a historical support level, and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that’s a strong case for a reversal trade. Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves.",

      "selftext": "When investing in stocks using fundamentals and charting do you look at overall market first? Right now I'm looking at investing using channel bottoms and EMA levels and want to scalp swing stock trades, overall market looks overbought and today smaller name stocks fell but QQQ/SPY/SPX were up. When doing investing and buying individual name stocks at the low end is it best to check the overall market trend before investing? Ex: if SPY/QQQ is in a rising wedge chances are market is going to fall - but lets say you found a stock already near the low end of the channel touching support. People using this strategy how do you manage the conflicting market movement? - Stick to the induvial stock names and not the overall market? [ [ [",

When doing investing and buying individual name stocks at the low end is it best to check the overall market trend before investing Ex if SPYQQQ is in a rising wedge chances are market is going to fall but lets say you found a stock already near the low end of the channel touching support . People using this strategy how do you manage the conflicting market movement Stick to the induvial stock names and not_the overall market"

      "title": "GLP-1R Agonist due diligence (Novo Nordisk stock analysis)",
      "selftext": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed, possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk. Wanted to post my analysis for critique: For context I have previously just held index funds (S&P 500 & FTSE 100) but with growing fears (believable IMO) of an AI/ Tech bubble and the fact that the S&P 500 is currently 34.43% weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks. My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start. Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP-1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future. They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss & obesity which is a plague of the western word. Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints (morbidity and mortality) like diabetes and heart disease etc. On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile (notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening). I'm not sure if many would disagree with this first point. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP-1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline. Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche, Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera. The horizon includes the oral version of Novo's existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly; Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novo's large molecule oral semaglutide. Lilly also has a triple agonist (retatrutide) which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing. Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II. So as alot of people have alluded to Novo's share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug (Tirzepatide / Mounjaro). I don't have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP-1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below. I have avoided using any forward looking metrics (like PEG or projected EPS) because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know? I've just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals. |**Stock**|**Roche**|**Amgen**|**Pfizer**|**Eli Lilly**|**Novo Nordisk**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Price in USD**|$422.11|$340.55|$25.66|$1,107.89|$57.11| |**Current Price before conversion**|336.40|340.55|$25.66|1,107.89|365.25| |**Market Cap ($)**|342.2B|184.4B|146.5B|1055.0B|253.6B| |**P/E**|28.68|26.37|14.91|54.04|15.6| |**EPS**|11.75|12.94|1.72|20.45|23.33| |**EV/EBITDA**|13.02|13.53|7.83|34.29|10.10| |**Debt / Equity**|1.05|5.67|0.67|1.79|0.60| |**ROIC**|18.54%|10.56%|7.04%|29.95%|42.81%| Not only does Novo have a much better P/E ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share, better value to earnings ratio, better debt to equity ratio. Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years. Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns. So this just means the business is well run and has good financials. But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs? That is definetely a possibility, especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron, but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer. So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly, and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term. Essentially it doesn't need to be see as a 'winner takes all situation' with such a large market. The problem with Lilly is the current price. Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04. It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise. And yes there are other risks for Novo, the standard pharma risks of drugs not working as intended, or intolerable side effects, but this isn't a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised. On the plus side Novo does have other (smaller) facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP-1 Market. I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies (including Lilly and maybe Roche) but weight it towards Novo. I'm not posting this all so you can agree with me, I'm hoping for (hopefully) insightful critiques. What am I not considering?",

      "selftext_processed": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk . Wanted to post my analysis for critique For context I have previously just held index funds SP 500 FTSE 100 but with growing fears believable IMO of an AI Tech bubble and the fact that the SP 500 is currently 34.43 % weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks . My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start . Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future . They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss obesity which is a plague of the western word . Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints morbidity and mortality like diabetes and heart disease etc . On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening . Im not_sure if many would disagree with this first point . Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline . Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera . The horizon includes the oral version of Novos existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novos large molecule oral semaglutide . Lilly also has a triple agonist retatrutide which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing . Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II . So as alot of people have alluded to Novos share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug Tirzepatide Mounjaro . I dont have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below . I have avoided using any forward looking metrics like PEG or projected EPS because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know Ive just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals . StockRocheAmgenPfizerEli LillyNovo Nordisk Price in USD $ 422.11 $ 340.55 $ 25.66 $ 1107.89 $ 57.11 Current Price before conversion336.40340.55 $ 25.661107.89365.25 Market Cap $ 342.2B184.4B146.5B1055.0B253.6B PE28.6826.3714.9154.0415.6 EPS11.7512.941.7220.4523.33 EVEBITDA13.0213.537.8334.2910.10 Debt Equity1.055.670.671.790.60 ROIC18.54 % 10.56 % 7.04 % 29.95 % 42.81 % Not_only does Novo have a much better PE ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share better value to earnings ratio better debt to equity ratio . Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years . Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns . So this just means the business is well run and has good financials . But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs That is definetely a possibility especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer . So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term . Essentially it doesnt need to be see as a winner takes all situation with such a large market . The problem with Lilly is the current price . Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04 . It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise . And yes there are other risks for Novo the standard pharma risks of drugs not_working as intended or intolerable side effects but this isnt a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised . On the plus side Novo does have other smaller facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP1 Market . I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies including Lilly and maybe Roche but weight it towards Novo . Im not_posting this all so you can agree with me Im hoping for hopefully insightful critiques . What am I not_considering"

I know we can’t predict the market, so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy. To start, I max out my Roth every year and am 80% invested in QQQ/SPY. I will continue to do that, and I will keep everything there. It’s currently about 30% of total my stock assets. I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio. Mostly tech. I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130% all time. So, I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in. (to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash) Selling out of: FANNG, and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG, TSM, CRWD, etc. (selling about 2/3 of all active portfolio) Keeping: MSFT, MELI, NNOX, PL, SOFI, COST, JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a) they’re my babies and have strong conviction b) moonshot potential c) confidence during recession.

      "selftext": "While many investors focus on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country’s reopening, digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Nubank ($NU) represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity. Venezuela’s large population, high mobile penetration, and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize. MercadoLibre, with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago, is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market, offering a growth avenue that isn’t immediately obvious to traditional commodity-focused investors. Similarly, Nubank’s technology-driven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population. Unlike conventional banks, Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, offering low-cost, accessible financial products to millions. If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions, Nubank could expand seamlessly, taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address. This potential remains under the radar compared with the headline-grabbing oil and gas plays. Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America, digital adoption, e‑commerce expansion, and financial inclusion, without relying on oil prices or resource exports. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector, these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela’s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance, potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize.",

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

      "selftext": "Hear me out, not a huge fire sale after today's Goldman Sachs spooking but might not be a bad entry. Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

Long SOFI although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $ 27 to $ 24 they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not_be offloading SOFI from their portfolios which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors . On the other hand Barclays increased target price from $ 24 to $ 28 . At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the SP 500 . Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30th expected revenue of $ 985.4 million and profit of $ 0.12 per share . Q3 revenue of $ 950 million beat analysts ’ previous estimates of $ 895 million . So far this year SOFI has risen 72 % . Predicted high for this year is $ 38 with a low of $ 12 . I ’ m looking for a entry point around $ 26.90 which after today ’ s offloading might not_be a bad spot as I dont believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th thoughts"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28% Tuesday, their best performance since February, after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference. >The stock is on a tear, leaping more than 47% in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1,080% since hitting a low on April 22. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index Tuesday, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, both of which posted double-digit percentage gains. >“For storage, that is a completely unserved market today,” Huang said at CES Monday. “This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world’s AIs.” >Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jake Silverman. Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said. >Memory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60% to 70% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year. >Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “key beneficiaries” of the push for “AI inferencing and AI at the edge” in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4. Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage “skyrocketing in tandem.” In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology. >“The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending,” Mohan wrote. “As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate.”",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28 % Tuesday their best performance since February after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference . The stock is on a tear leaping more than 47 % in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1080 % since hitting a low on April 22 . It was the best performer in the SP 500 Index Tuesday followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc both of which posted doubledigit percentage gains . “ For storage that is a completely unserved market today ” Huang said at CES Monday . “ This is a market that never_existed and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world basically holding the working memory of the world ’ s AIs. ” Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks according to Bloomberg Intelligence ’ s Jake Silverman . Huang ’ s comments at CES “ suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems ” he said . Memory prices have been steadily climbing . Earlier this week Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60 % to 70 % in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year . Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “ key beneficiaries ” of the push for “ AI inferencing and AI at the edge ” in 2026 Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4 . Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training analytics and compliance purposes with demand for storage “ skyrocketing in tandem. ” In particular he cited growing use in drones surveillance vehicles and sports technology . “ The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models that has created the next wave in hardware spending ” Mohan wrote . “ As we look at 2026 and beyond we expect AI Inference to dominate . ”"

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

FactSet ’ s revenue doesn ’ t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity . Most revenue is subscriptionbased which gives the business strong visibility and predictability . That model has worked for a long time . FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades . Recent Earnings In its most recent fiscal year ended August 31 2025 FactSet reported • Revenue of $ 2.32B up about 5 % year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value ASV growth of 5.7 % • Net income of $ 597M up 11 % • GAAP EPS of $ 15.55 up nearly 12 % • Continued strong free cash flow alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6 % organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $ 2.42–2.45B . Why Stock is Low Margins have come under pressure mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment . FactSet however isn ’ t spending defensively — it ’ s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data . Why that Doesn ’ t Matter A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data . That matters in an AIdriven environment . Many competitors rely more heavily on thirdparty data which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top . FactSet ’ s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for . Position"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."

      "title": "Volume II: Congress and the President are telling you what will dominate the market and none of you are listening (nuclear & rare earths)",
      "selftext": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium & Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this: Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing. Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way. ￼ This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security. ￼ You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real. ￼ All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes. ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed. That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress. Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up. Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

      "selftext_processed": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security specifically to Uranium Rare Earths . I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days . Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand . Check this Uranium isn ’ t ripping because of headlines . It ’ s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action . For years the narrative was “ renewables can do it ” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible . That was suppression . Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression . Inventories got drained . Mines stayed closed . Licensing stayed slow . Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing . Now you ’ re seeing the change . Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing deployment and implementation of nuclear energy policies . That hearing isn ’ t symbolic it ’ s strategic . Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can ’ t meet AI and industrial demand any other way . ￼ This isn ’ t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point . This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog . That ’ s the kind of governmentlevel pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security . ￼ You can see markets already moving on this . NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn ’ t just talk congressional heat makes it more real . ￼ All the antinuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue . AI energy demand exposed the grid ’ s limitations and the same committee that has talked about AI ’ s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes . ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression . When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year that signals policy momentum not_posturing . Politicians aren ’ t just parroting soundbites they ’ re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed . That ’ s why uranium is behaving the way it is . This isn ’ t a retail meme rally . This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints . The market was suppressed . Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress . Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it . If they were just talking prices wouldn ’ t care . But this is action . And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up . Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history outside of bitcoin and you all are sleeping .

      "title": "SEZL is the BEST setup for 2026: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \\~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \\~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger: # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25). Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY. I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger. **ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:** The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** EDIT: position",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Sezzle SEZL is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026 . 15 Forward PE for 2026 w earnings growing 30 % . Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . NOTE the drop in Sezzle ’ s SEZL Q2 2025 TTM Trailing Twelve Month EPS drop is primarily due to a onetime significant tax benefit in Q2 2024 rolling off the twelvemonth calculation . Operating Income actually grew by 116 % yearoveryear from $ 16.7M in Q2 ‘ 24 to $ 36.1M in Q2 ‘ 25 . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile . At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger . ALSO CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . EDIT position"

      "selftext": "{this is a short term play, im not \"investing\" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years} During the press conference yesterday Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure” *Source:* [Youtube]( Timestamp: 37:25 **1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history** In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant: * ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed. * ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized. * Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational. *Result*? Production fell from \\~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd. **2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like** This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention. **3) Who makes money first?** * **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk. * **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets. * **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty. **Where I put my money** *Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes *Phase 2*: Chevron *Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil **Doubts:** Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done. Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early. About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories. Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours. ⸻ **TL;DR** Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",

      "selftext_processed": "this is a short term play im not_investing in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years During the press conference yesterday Trump said “ We are going to be running it Venezuela with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure ” Source Youtube Timestamp 3725 1 For those who werent around in 2007 quick history In 2007 Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSAcontrolled joint ventures . PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company . Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave . For the US this meant ExxonMobil refused . Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated . Years of arbitration followed . ConocoPhillips refused . Same outcome . Large projects seized . Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational . Result Production fell from 3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd . 2 What a “ rebuild ” actually looks like This is not_about new megaprojects . It starts with fixing what already exists . Workovers on shutin wells . Pipeline repairs and leak control . Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders . Restoring export terminals . Venezuelan crude is extraheavy . You can not produce it without services chemicals and constant intervention . 3 Who makes money first Phase 1 Oilfield services . Short contracts . Fast cash flow . Low political risk . Phase 2 Operators with existing licenses and assets . Phase 3 Majors that demand longterm legal certainty . Where I put my money Phase 1 Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes Phase 2 Chevron Phase 3 ConocoPhillips ExxonMobil Doubts Isnt this all a bit premature Yes absolutely but the stock market doesnt let you wait until its all said and done . Isnt it late already Maybe all these companies are already up ±210 % premarket . But Id say its still early . About Phase 3 players I ’ m unsure how they will react . They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild . I guess they ’ d be repaid by grants for rebuilding . But I ’ m unsure . The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd . Maybe one of you guys has better theories . Do with this as you will . Im in and shared my view . happy to see yours . ⸻ TLDR Trump said “ We are going to be running it Venezuela with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure ” . A rebuild starts with repairs not_new oil dreams . Oilfield services get paid first Chevron benefits next . Exxon and Conoco are optional upside not_the core play . Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but Im in . My bet is on Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes and Chevron for now ."
