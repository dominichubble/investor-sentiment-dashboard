What I like about these kinds of discussions is how traders and investors share their views, ideas, and different approaches. It makes learning about stocks and market moves feel a lot more engaging than trying to figure everything out alone. If you’re into investing or even just curious about what others are thinking right now, definitely check it out. 📊💬 Let me know your thoughts if you read through it!",

What I like about these kinds of discussions is how traders and investors share their views ideas and different approaches . It makes learning about stocks and market moves feel a lot more engaging than trying to figure everything out alone . If you ’ re into investing or even just curious about what others are thinking right now definitely check it out . 📊💬 Let me know your thoughts if you read through it"

      "selftext": "CLF bet on earnings been following for awhile. POSCO deal will be announced as to whether or not the will invest 10-20% stake in CLF APRIL 1st at latest based on SEC report. If mentioned during CLF earnings conference (Monday Feb 9) before market open as to how that’s panning out. Likely to see a lot of movement. STLD and NUE missed top and bottom lines. But forecasted record demand. CLF unlike others mentioned use blast furnace meaning they can’t shut off production as it cost too much but the slow down so they stack excess steel in downturns. With immediate growing demand they could’ve fulfilled a lot of the record inflows as NUE and STLD needed to pick pace up and didn’t have time to do so. This leads me to believe CLF may be the anomaly as they had product stacked up. <- Just theory. Mango steel tariffs and increasing demand should start to help CLF with profit margins and reduce debt. Mango rare earth minerals contracts, naval contracts, and massive Cap ex from hyperscalers should play crucial effect on steel demand. Tax season time new cars will start coming out of lot. CLF rare earth results may somewhat meme as well as we seen last quarter but if real results and timeline could be issues on existing mines could play a legitimate roll in future valuation of CLF. All things things added together we can expect extreme returns I posted late as this play could lure people in too early as this earnings is very High risk-High reward and I like to remain accurate on timelines and this earnings is extremely up in the air. This play is intended for January 2027 as we see continued demand, possible interest rate cuts mid year around June I expect we see massive increase in price like what we seen during mangos 1st term which the stock quadrupled at 1 point.

      "selftext": "Let me preface this by saying that I have taken some economics in college but by no means I am expert. Just an observation from an average person. Weakening of USD is deliberate. This makes many economic indicators look great on paper. GDP rises because of inflation and devaluation of USD. Exports will become more attractive. Also raises the GDP. It becomes expensive to import. This \"should boost\" manufacturing domestically. However, this weakens buying power of USD, therefore money is worth less. With wage stagnation, pushes middle class lower and poor even more poor. Wealthy will be fine because assets will appreciate. Just for context. USD - CHF pair down 14% in a year. Look at Swiss Franc because of low inflation in Switzerland. With that being said, S&P 500 is up 13.9%, DOW 12%. Yet euro stocks like EZU ETF is up 31.39%. Asian stocks 31.99% for a year. American companies are stagnating or already overvalued and others are catching up. Then we have inconsistent inflation data. Paired with with highest layoffs since 2009. Maybe we are overweight and over employed. Needless to say, it is not looking good. How are they going to prop up the economy at these rates? Topped with more money printing and QE policies. I'm not liking where we headed. Did I miss the plot somewhere? Edit: Sorry for the typo. $50,000",

Weakening of USD is deliberate . This makes many economic indicators look great on paper . GDP rises because of inflation and devaluation of USD . Exports will become more attractive . Also raises the GDP . It becomes expensive to import . This should boost manufacturing domestically . However this weakens buying power of USD therefore money is worth less . With wage stagnation pushes middle class lower and poor even more poor . Wealthy will be fine because assets will appreciate . Just for context . USD CHF pair down 14 % in a year . Look at Swiss Franc because of low inflation in Switzerland . With that being said SP 500 is up 13.9 % DOW 12 % . Yet euro stocks like EZU ETF is up 31.39 % . Asian stocks 31.99 % for a year . American companies are stagnating or already overvalued and others are catching up . Then we have inconsistent inflation data . Paired with with highest layoffs since 2009 . Maybe we are overweight and over employed . Needless to say it is not_looking good . How are they going to prop up the economy at these rates Topped with more money printing and QE policies . Im not_liking where we headed . Did I miss the plot somewhere Edit Sorry for the typo . $ 50000"

Shares of online telehealth company Hims and Hers Health HIMS fell nearly 12 % in afterhours trade . The FDA said it is also taking steps to combat ⁠misleading directtoconsumer advertising and ‌marketing following warning letters that were sent in the fall of 2025 . The U.S. Department of Health and ‍Human Services General Counsel Mike Stuart also said on Friday he has referred Hims Hers to the Department of Justice for investigation over potential violations ​following a review of the applicable facts . Hims and Hers did ‌not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment . The company had said earlier on Thursday that it would begin offering copies of Novo Nordisks new Wegovy pill at an introductory price of $ 49 per month about $ 100 less than the brand name . Novo Nordisk NVO later said ⁠it would take legal action against the ​telehealth company over its plan to ​sell compounded copies of the drug . The health regulator said that in promotional materials companies can not claim that nonFDAapproved ‍compounded products are ⁠generic versions or the same as drugs approved by FDA . It added that they also can not state compounded drugs use the same ⁠active ingredient as the FDAapproved drugs or that compounded drugs are clinically proven ‌to produce results for the patient ."

      "selftext": "Despite the impressive run in the markets today: SPY: +1.92% QQQ: +2.11% it looks like distribution is taking place over the last 3 months in the markets. [SPY - 10 min]( [QQQ - 10 min]( SPY made a lower high and a lower low and just managed to piece through the 5 day moving average today. QQQ has performed worse where previous level of support could very well turn resistance. Combine this with the lofty narratives and story telling about AI and the outrageous amount of infrastructure being built for it, this suspiciously sounds like speculation. I'm short these three stocks (LEAPS puts): TSLA, NVDA, PLTR. Currently, my positions are up around 5%, 8%, 8% respectively. 1. TSLA [TSLA - Weekly]( The price is hovering at the VWAP since late July of 2025. The average loser since then is losing money on the stock. [TSLA - 10 min]( On a shorter time frame, the previous band of support is seemingly acting as resistance. The 5 day MA is trending down. Given the high valuation of the stock, this won't be a bad place for new entries as well as to hold your short. Additionally, Elon has been just moving from one business to another when competitors catch up and now planning a merger with his other ventures. This IMO is a red flag. If the 5 day moving average stabilizes and starts pointing upwards, and it breaks through this resistance, I'll close my position and humbly accept I was wrong. 2. NVDA [NVDA - 10 mins]( NVDA also started reversing towards the end of the day after, admittedly, having a really strong run from its down days. Even though it's above the 5 day MA, the MA is still pointing down and perhaps NVDA could consolidate and run higher from here. I will close my position if that happens. If you ignore today's run, the average investor since May 2025 would've been losing money. This is for the most hyped stock on the street. Despite the hype, the stock is hovering at levels since August of last year. This also looks like distribution. Combine this with the circular deals and increasing depreciation years look like cooking the books to me. Hence, I'm short. 3. PLTR I'm most bearish on this one. Everyone knows about the ridiculous valuation it has in relation to its earnings. There's an endless AI/modern warfare narration around this stock and it seems priced for perfection and rarely ever do things go perfectly. People call this a growth stock as if growth is a free pass to be completely disconnected from financials. As you can see from the chart, I have a short position since Jan 13 when the price was around $180. Notice the VWAP from early August lows. The average investor since that low is losing money. Let alone the people who bought this stock above $180. I feel more pain is in store for this stock and I can see this one sliding close to $100. The VWAP since earnings aligns perfectly with the 5 day MA and despite a green day today and blowout earnings, this seems to be trending down in the short term as well. In fact, I'd mentioned on another thread or forum that the earnings pop seemed like a bull trap, and indeed it did trap quite a few. Excited and impatient speculators or bag holders must have been very happy with the price action today and I'm sure many loaded up with the lint of their pockets on this one by averaging down. If my assessment is correct, this just mean greater pain for them. This stock has lately gotten a reality check and hopefully it continues to do so. My exit plan is if it rises above the VWAP from earnings, 5 day MA flattens or starts rising and it stabilizes in that region around 140-145. More power to you all! PS: I hold long positions on TSLA and NVDA both and I'm up significantly up on those. These are just hedges for additional money against all the speculation and downturns. Of course, this is not financial advice!",

      "selftext_processed": "Despite the impressive run in the markets today SPY 1.92 % QQQ 2.11 % it looks like distribution is taking place over the last 3 months in the markets . SPY 10 min QQQ 10 min SPY made a lower high and a lower low and just managed to piece through the 5 day moving average today . QQQ has performed worse where previous level of support could very well turn resistance . Combine this with the lofty narratives and story telling about AI and the outrageous amount of infrastructure being built for it this suspiciously sounds like speculation . Im short these three stocks LEAPS puts TSLA NVDA PLTR . Currently my positions are up around 5 % 8 % 8 % respectively . 1 . TSLA TSLA Weekly The price is hovering at the VWAP since late July of 2025 . The average loser since then is losing money on the stock . TSLA 10 min On a shorter time frame the previous band of support is seemingly acting as resistance . The 5 day MA is trending down . Given the high valuation of the stock this wont be a bad place for new entries as well as to hold your short . Additionally Elon has been just moving from one business to another when competitors catch up and now planning a merger with his other ventures . This IMO is a red flag . If the 5 day moving average stabilizes and starts pointing upwards and it breaks through this resistance Ill close my position and humbly accept I was wrong . 2 . NVDA NVDA 10 mins NVDA also started reversing towards the end of the day after admittedly having a really strong run from its down days . Even though its above the 5 day MA the MA is still pointing down and perhaps NVDA could consolidate and run higher from here . I will close my position if that happens . If you ignore todays run the average investor since May 2025 wouldve been losing money . This is for the most hyped stock on the street . Despite the hype the stock is hovering at levels since August of last year . This also looks like distribution . Combine this with the circular deals and increasing depreciation years look like cooking the books to me . Hence Im short . 3 . PLTR Im most bearish on this one . Everyone knows about the ridiculous valuation it has in relation to its earnings . Theres an endless AImodern warfare narration around this stock and it seems priced for perfection and rarely ever do things go perfectly . People call this a growth stock as if growth is a free pass to be completely disconnected from financials . As you can see from the chart I have a short position since Jan 13 when the price was around $ 180 . Notice the VWAP from early August lows . The average investor since that low is losing money . Let alone the people who bought this stock above $ 180 . I feel more pain is in store for this stock and I can see this one sliding close to $ 100 . The VWAP since earnings aligns perfectly with the 5 day MA and despite a green day today and blowout earnings this seems to be trending down in the short term as well . In fact Id mentioned on another thread or forum that the earnings pop seemed like a bull trap and indeed it did trap quite a few . Excited and impatient speculators or bag holders must have been very happy with the price action today and Im sure many loaded up with the lint of their pockets on this one by averaging down . If my assessment is correct this just mean greater pain for them . This stock has lately gotten a reality check and hopefully it continues to do so . My exit plan is if it rises above the VWAP from earnings 5 day MA flattens or starts rising and it stabilizes in that region around 140145 . More power to you all PS I hold long positions on TSLA and NVDA both and Im up significantly up on those . These are just hedges for additional money against all the speculation and downturns . Of course this is not_financial advice"

      "selftext": "It gets mentioned as one of many factors but it just seems to me this is the one highly probable event that could be a black swan and there has been very little discussion of that. The two sides are so far apart - we want total capitulation and they will yield on nothing at all - that any \"talks\" are just posturing for the inevitable. I don't see any how either side could back down. Anything less than an overwhelming display of dominance by the US will be bad. And if we should suffer major losses I don't see how the market doesn't implode. Even if they don't get many of our planes and ships, Iran knows our end goal is regime change so they will have nothing to lose and will fight in every way they can. That could mean terrorist attacks in the US or on US interests worldwide. They could go scorched earth and attack US corporations, sink oil tankers, carry out assassinations, or even target the civilian population. I haven't liquidated but I've been lightening positions and have passed on what normally I would have seen as great buying opportunities. Anyone else here basing their strategy around this?",

The two sides are so far apart we want total capitulation and they will yield on nothing_at all that any talks are just posturing for the inevitable . I dont see any how either side could back down . Anything less than an overwhelming display of dominance by the US will be bad . And if we should suffer major losses I dont see how the market doesnt implode . Even if they dont get many of our planes and ships Iran knows our end goal is regime change so they will have nothing_to lose and will fight in every way they can . That could mean terrorist attacks in the US or on US interests worldwide . They could go scorched earth and attack US corporations sink oil tankers carry out assassinations or even target the civilian population . I havent liquidated but Ive been lightening positions and have passed on what normally I would have seen as great buying opportunities . Anyone else here basing their strategy around this"

One of my core filters has always been management quality, and even then Elon was already a concern, but the numbers backed the thesis. Fast forward to now and I finally pulled the trigger. Not because of politics, not because of vibes, and not out of spite. I ran the models again, reread earnings, looked at demand curves, margins, capex, and guidance.

Ai implementation will be used to enhance the profitability of these giants by finding new ways to Squeeze out more money per user through existing services and reduce expenses that would never_be thought of . And I bet there is more potential there than most market makers realize . Hopefully this post made you anger with its poor writing skills that means a something ImPerfect made it Ig .

      "selftext": "This is a textbook observation. I’m highlighting a historical \"line in the sand.\" The $7.00 - $8.00 range served as a massive support zone for SNAP for years. However, as of this week that \"floor\" has officially given way. Is it reasonable based on their Q4 earnings? I don’t believe it is. Think of it as a floor made of concrete versus one made of glass. Ever since 2018 the stock had strong support at $7 but concrete turned into glass this week. I feel like for a seven-year-solid floor made of concrete to burst earnings would have to be pretty rough, and they really weren’t. They lowered forecast (which is always a bloodbath ignition) and they lost 5 % of their most important user base- North Americans. Nevertheless, they were more profitable than ever before adding to the trend that began in the prior quarter. They beat expected EPS by 200 %. Additionally, their user base did go up in total, just not in North America isolated. And, their revenue was up 10 % YoY. Okay so one more “bomb”- they delayed the perplexity deal and also apparently didn’t do the $500m share buybacks they’d planned for the quarter but then said they are now going to I’d call it a classic mixed earnings result. The stock initially reacted positively to the earnings report and went up 7 % in the after market but then nosedived 14 % the next day. A more intense version of what happened to RDDT today but kinda the same thing. Anyway. $7 was the “floor” for so long. For seven years. I’m curious to hear what you all think about the chances that it will reestablish its support level around $7 soon or if it’s now going to be trading in the $5-6 range for months? Today, the US market is up 2 % across the board. SNAP is merely up 2 % as well at time of writing this. So, maybe it’s not going to jump 35 % and get back to $7 next week- if it makes a move this small on a day that the market is so green. They have 500 million daily active users. They finally started monetizing more effectively. I’m not a fan of the Spectacles AR adventure… but I don’t believe Snapchat is a dying business. I think there will be a buyout before it dies. But it seems like the founder doesn’t ever want to sell.",

However, as of this week that \"floor\" has officially given way. Is it reasonable based on their Q4 earnings? I don’t believe it is. Think of it as a floor made of concrete versus one made of glass. Ever since 2018 the stock had strong support at $7 but concrete turned into glass this week. I feel like for a seven-year-solid floor made of concrete to burst earnings would have to be pretty rough, and they really weren’t. They lowered forecast (which is always a bloodbath ignition) and they lost 5 % of their most important user base- North Americans. Nevertheless, they were more profitable than ever before adding to the trend that began in the prior quarter. They beat expected EPS by 200 %. Additionally, their user base did go up in total, just not in North America isolated. And, their revenue was up 10 % YoY. Okay so one more “bomb”- they delayed the perplexity deal and also apparently didn’t do the $500m share buybacks they’d planned for the quarter but then said they are now going to I’d call it a classic mixed earnings result. The stock initially reacted positively to the earnings report and went up 7 % in the after market but then nosedived 14 % the next day.

I’m curious to hear what you all think about the chances that it will reestablish its support level around $7 soon or if it’s now going to be trading in the $5-6 range for months? Today, the US market is up 2 % across the board. SNAP is merely up 2 % as well at time of writing this. So, maybe it’s not going to jump 35 % and get back to $7 next week- if it makes a move this small on a day that the market is so green. They have 500 million daily active users. They finally started monetizing more effectively. I’m not a fan of the Spectacles AR adventure… but I don’t believe Snapchat is a dying business. I think there will be a buyout before it dies.

      "selftext_processed": "This is a textbook observation . I ’ m highlighting a historical line in the sand . The $ 7.00 $ 8.00 range served as a massive support zone for SNAP for years . However as of this week that floor has officially given way . Is it reasonable based on their Q4 earnings I don ’ t believe it is . Think of it as a floor made of concrete versus one made of glass . Ever since 2018 the stock had strong support at $ 7 but concrete turned into glass this week . I feel like for a sevenyearsolid floor made of concrete to burst earnings would have to be pretty rough and they really weren ’ t . They lowered forecast which is always a bloodbath ignition and they lost 5 % of their most important user base North Americans . Nevertheless they were more profitable than ever before adding to the trend that began in the prior quarter . They beat expected EPS by 200 % . Additionally their user base did go up in total just not_in North America isolated . And their revenue was up 10 % YoY . Okay so one more “ bomb ” they delayed the perplexity deal and also apparently didn ’ t do the $ 500m share buybacks they ’ d planned for the quarter but then said they are now going to I ’ d call it a classic mixed earnings result . The stock initially reacted positively to the earnings report and went up 7 % in the after market but then nosedived 14 % the next day . A more intense version of what happened to RDDT today but kinda the same thing . Anyway . $ 7 was the “ floor ” for so long . For seven years . I ’ m curious to hear what you all think about the chances that it will reestablish its support level around $ 7 soon or if it ’ s now going to be trading in the $ 56 range for months Today the US market is up 2 % across the board . SNAP is merely up 2 % as well at time of writing this . So maybe it ’ s not_going to jump 35 % and get back to $ 7 next week if it makes a move this small on a day that the market is so green . They have 500 million daily active users . They finally started monetizing more effectively . I ’ m not_a fan of the Spectacles AR adventure… but I don ’ t believe Snapchat is a dying business . I think there will be a buyout before it dies . But it seems like the founder doesn ’ t ever want to sell ."

      "selftext": "I’m seeing the same \"buy the dip\" garbage on every thread today. People are unironically calling Microsoft at these levels a \"no-brainer buy\" while the entire software sector is getting liquidated. If you think this is just a \"sale,\" you aren't paying attention. you're gambling on a world that doesn't exist anymore. We just saw $285 billion in market cap vanish in a single day. This isn't a \"glitch.\" This is a fundamental repricing of the entire SaaS model. \"AI Eats Software\" is actually happening While you’re busy looking at historical P/E ratios, Anthropic just dropped a nuke on the industry with its new \"Cowork\" tool. This isn't just another chatbot; it’s an AI agent that automates legal workflows, contract reviews, and compliance; the high-margin bread and butter that companies like Thomson Reuters and RELX have built moats around for decades. The result? Thomson Reuters plummeted 18%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. The contagion: It’s spreading to everything. Salesforce and Adobe are down 7% today, but look at the bigger picture: Salesforce has lost half its value in a year. Adobe is down 45%. The Microsoft \"Safe Haven\" is a Myth \"But Microsoft is too big to fail!\" Is it? and is that your only argumet to buy stock? rly? if „buy microsoft because it alwas goes up“ is your only argument then you are merely gbling and not investing. you might as well say „i always bet on red!“ investing is looking at the fundamentals and at the current market. once a time buying kodak was a safe bet. once a time. They just admitted they are pouring more money into AI infrastructure than anyone expected, and for what? Azure's growth is missing expectations. The cloud \"revolution\" is slowing down while the Capex is exploding. Microsoft dropped 13% in five days. That’s not a \"dip\", that’s a correction for a company that just realized it might be spending hundreds of billions to build its own competition. Why \"Buy the Dip\" is Dangerous Right Now: The PayPal Disaster: Look at PayPal, down over 20%. New CEO? Disappointing numbers? Investors aren't waiting for a \"turnaround\" anymore. They are exiting industries they think are being commoditized by AI. The Crypto Slide: Even Bitcoin is sliding (now around $76k but hey BTC is wacky anyway huh?). There is a massive liquidity drain happening as people realize the \"AI productivity jump\" actually threatens the subscription revenues of the incumbents we all hold. Gaming isn't safe either: Last week, Google's new AI tool sent gaming stocks into a tailspin. If you want to throw your money into a furnace because \"stonks only go up,\" go ahead. But stop calling it a \"no-brainer.\" The brainless move is ignoring that the \"SaaSpocalypse\" is here. The software giants aren't just competing with each other anymore; they’re competing with tools that make their entire monopolistic throne crumble. will microsoft go broke? surely not. but the stock was massively overhyped due to software being „exclusve“. now their high tower is getting more level. did digital cameras killed photography as a career? no but they made it less glamorous and now its a normal job and not a „superstar job“ anymore. you guys are buying analogie cameras because they are on discount without realizing that digital cameras jist got mainstream. TL;DR: Stop looking at the 5-year chart and start looking at the 5-day reality. AI isn't helping these companies; it's taking the exclusivity markup off them.",

People are unironically calling Microsoft at these levels a nobrainer buy while the entire software sector is getting liquidated . If you think this is just a sale you arent paying attention . youre gambling on a world that doesnt exist anymore . We just saw $ 285 billion in market cap vanish in a single day . This isnt a glitch . This is a fundamental repricing of the entire SaaS model . AI Eats Software is actually happening While you ’ re busy looking at historical PE ratios Anthropic just dropped a nuke on the industry with its new Cowork tool . This isnt just another chatbot it ’ s an AI agent that automates legal workflows contract reviews and compliance the highmargin bread and butter that companies like Thomson Reuters and RELX have built moats around for decades . The result Thomson Reuters plummeted 18 % . LegalZoom crashed nearly 20 % . The contagion It ’ s spreading to everything . Salesforce and Adobe are down 7 % today but look at the bigger picture Salesforce has lost half its value in a year . Adobe is down 45 % . The Microsoft Safe Haven is a Myth But Microsoft is too big to fail Is it and is that your only argumet to buy stock rly if „ buy microsoft because it alwas goes up “ is your only argument then you are merely gbling and not_investing . you might as well say „ i always bet on red “ investing is looking at the fundamentals and at the current market . once a time buying kodak was a safe bet . once a time . They just admitted they are pouring more money into AI infrastructure than anyone expected and for what Azures growth is missing expectations . The cloud revolution is slowing down while the Capex is exploding . Microsoft dropped 13 % in five days . That ’ s not_a dip that ’ s a correction for a company that just realized it might be spending hundreds of billions to build its own competition . Why Buy the Dip is Dangerous Right Now The PayPal Disaster Look at PayPal down over 20 % . New CEO Disappointing numbers Investors arent waiting for a turnaround anymore . They are exiting industries they think are being commoditized by AI . The Crypto Slide Even Bitcoin is sliding now around $ 76k but hey BTC is wacky anyway huh . There is a massive liquidity drain happening as people realize the AI productivity jump actually threatens the subscription revenues of the incumbents we all hold . Gaming isnt safe either Last week Googles new AI tool sent gaming stocks into a tailspin . If you want to throw your money into a furnace because stonks only go up go ahead . But stop calling it a nobrainer . The brainless move is ignoring that the SaaSpocalypse is here . The software giants arent just competing with each other anymore they ’ re competing with tools that make their entire monopolistic throne crumble . will microsoft go broke surely not_but the stock was massively overhyped due to software being „ exclusve “ . now their high tower is getting more level . did digital cameras killed photography as a career no_but they made it less glamorous and now its a normal job and not_a „ superstar job “ anymore . you guys are buying analogie cameras because they are on discount without realizing that digital cameras jist got mainstream . TLDR Stop looking at the 5year chart and start looking at the 5day reality . AI isnt helping these companies its taking the exclusivity markup off them ."

      "selftext": "The Recession Narrative Doesn't Match the Data Yesterday's Challenger layoff numbers (108,435 for January, highest since 2009) sparked aggressive selling in premarket that carried into the session. The narrative: Fed is \"behind the curve\" and labor weakness is morphing into recession. But the broader data tells a different story. The Disconnect: PMI came in red hot at the start of this week. Atlanta Fed Nowcast is projecting GDP with a 5 handle this quarter. Most economic indicators aren't showing cracks consistent with recession. This looks like efficiency-driven cuts, not demand collapse. Companies aren't cutting because business is dying (PMI proves otherwise). They're cutting bloat to implement AI and improve margins. That's productivity growth, not recession. Big Tech's Reality Check: Microsoft disclosed 45% of their future cloud contracts (Remaining Performance Obligations) are tied to OpenAI. That's concentration risk the market is now pricing in. Amazon announced $200B capex despite strong earnings. Market's digesting the sheer scale of AI infrastructure costs. The Technical Picture: SPX tested 6720 overnight before bouncing back above 6800. This 6800 level is critical. If we close the week above it, the Q1 chop thesis (range-bound action before breaking higher) stays intact. Charm range today: 6700-6900. My Take: The layoff numbers likely give incoming Fed Chair Warsh the mandate to cut rates immediately upon taking office. While the market feared Powell was too late, these numbers ensure the new Chair can be dovish with data-driven cover. I'm holding SPY shares but staying cautious. Looking for 6800 to hold into the weekend. What's your positioning here?",

      "selftext": "MDI.TO – Major Drilling – is the specialist digging deep, complex, hard-rock projects worldwide. They don’t own the mines but enable the REE & critical minerals boom. Latest Earnings Last reported quarter: Q2 FY2026 (reported December 10, 2025) Revenue: CAD 244 million (record quarter, strong year-over-year growth) EBITDA: CAD 38 million Margins: Stable despite cost pressure Balance sheet: \\- Net debt: essentially zero \\- Liquidity: CAD 149 million available \\- Strong cash position, no financial stress 👉 Key point: MDI is profitable, cash-generative, and financially solid. ⸻ The Rare Earth (REE) & Critical Minerals: \\- The West must catch up on rare earths and critical minerals. \\- China dominates REE mining and processing this is now a strategic risk. \\- G7 countries are pushing for supply chain independence. This all means more exploration, not less. ⸻ Why MDI Matters: \\- Easy deposits are gone. \\- New discoveries are deeper, harder, and more complex. \\- This requires specialized deep drilling, not standard equipment. \\- MDI is a global specialist in deep, hard-rock, complex drilling. \\- MDI benefits from more drilling activity without owning the mines. 👉 MDI sells the picks and shovels of the critical-minerals cycle. ⸻ Simple Takeaway Strong balance sheet + record revenue + structural REE demand = MDI is well positioned for the next 3–5 years.

Anyhow, how’s my allocation? A few said maybe bump up international fund to maybe 15-20%? And my large cap growth can be dialed-back maybe to 10-15% as the S&P 500 makes up about 75-80% of it?

VUG has over 150 holdings. I've got all that. What I'm not understanding is, why is VUG more top heavy? I would have thought that with MORE holdings they would be less top heavy. The top 3 holdings for both are NVDA, MSFT and AAPL but that makes up 35% of VUG and only 22% of QQQM. I just was looking this morning and noticed that my VUG position is dowm much more than QQQM this year and that's why I was looking at this a bit more closely. Anyone know why VUG is more top heavy even with more companies in the index? I'm guessing there are some holdings in QQQM that are not in VUG that are impacting the weighting, but instead of researching I suspect someone here knows the answer.",

The top 3 holdings for both are NVDA MSFT and AAPL but that makes up 35 % of VUG and only 22 % of QQQM . I just was looking this morning and noticed that my VUG position is dowm much more than QQQM this year and thats why I was looking at this a bit more closely . Anyone know why VUG is more top heavy even with more companies in the index Im guessing there are some holdings in QQQM that are not_in VUG that are impacting the weighting but instead of researching I suspect someone here knows the answer ."

Now crypto is getting absolutely taken out back and I can’t help but feel like the window might finally be opening. My core portfolio over the last \\~4 years has been TSLA, PLTR, NVDA, GOOG, plus CRWV more recently. I’m looking to add one more high-conviction position during this correction. Is COIN the cleanest way to play this crypto bloodbath, or is there a better opportunity I’m overlooking? For context, I’m already holding \\~US$11k in BTC (was \\~US$24k not long ago… pain). Not looking for short-term trades, i'm more of a multi-year (5+ year) holders. Curious to hear how others are thinking about this current time - I'm also open to other (non-crypto related) stock picks that would slot perfectly into my portfolio.",

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic .

      "selftext": "This isn’t a crash and it doesn’t look like one. High-yield credit (HYG) has barely moved, and that’s usually the first place real trouble shows up. In actual crashes, credit cracks... What we’re seeing looks more like a normal reset after a strong run volatility up, sentiment flipped, while credit and liquidity stay fine. That’s not the market breaking. That’s risk getting repriced. Selling into this kind of fear is usually how people lock in losses. Buying quality names during it is how long-term returns are made. Doesn’t mean we rip straight back to highs, just that this is a buying environment, not panic mode. And yes, the VIX is elevated, but without credit stress it’s fear, not a crash. Happy to hear counterpoints if anyone’s seeing genuine stress signals I’m missing. But if crashes were obvious and widely predicted on social media, they wouldn’t really be crashes.... Just a thought for everyone screaming it's the end of the world again.",

In actual crashes credit cracks ... What we ’ re seeing looks more like a normal reset after a strong run volatility up sentiment flipped while credit and liquidity stay fine . That ’ s not_the market breaking . That ’ s risk getting repriced . Selling into this kind of fear is usually how people lock in losses . Buying quality names during it is how longterm returns are made . Doesn ’ t mean we rip straight back to highs just that this is a buying environment not_panic mode . And yes the VIX is elevated but without credit stress it ’ s fear not_a crash . Happy to hear counterpoints if anyone ’ s seeing genuine stress signals I ’ m missing . But if crashes were obvious and widely predicted on social media they wouldn ’ t really be crashes .... Just a thought for everyone screaming its the end of the world again ."

I also told you so a few days ago: **Amazon:** >“We are monetizing capacity as fast as we can install it.” >“I think every provider would tell you, including us, that we could actually grow faster if we had all the supply that we could take.” >“We expect to invest about $200 billion in capital expenditures across Amazon, but predominantly in AWS, because we have very high demand.” >“Our backlog is $244 billion. That’s up 40% year over year. I think it’s up 22% quarter over quarter.” **Google:** >“We’ve been supply constrained even as we’ve been ramping up our capacity.” >“Backlog grew by 55% quarter over quarter to $240 billion representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products.” >“Today, more than 120,000 enterprises use Gemini…” **Microsoft:** >“Our customer demand continues to exceed our supply.” >“We’re working as hard as we can to add capacity as quickly as we can… we need to make sure we’ve got power and land and facilities available.” >“Github Copilot Pro Plus subs for individual devs increased 77% quarter over quarter, and all up now, we have 4.7 million paid Copilot subscribers, up 75% year over year.” >Commercial (backlog) remaining performance obligation, continues to be reported net of reserves, increased to $625 billion. And was up 11% year over year with a weighted average duration of approximately two and a half years.” **Meta:** >“On your first question, we do continue to be capacity constrained.” >“Anticipate 2026 capital expenditures… to be in the range of $115 to $135 billion with year-over-year growth driven by increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business.” >“I would say that we think that there is room for our larger models to benefit from having more compute.” Meanwhile, Reddit users with $500 invested in stocks while working at a McDonald's confidently claim: No AI demand, AI demand is fake, businesses don't find value in AI, AI slop this and that, but Michael Burry said, no one is making any money from AI, AI has no moat, AI has no business model, but circular economy, it's just a collusion to keep the AI bubble going When are people finally going to realize that the huge CapEx is almost entirely due to real AI demand? Not only that but models continue to get smarter, faster. The intelligence graph is accelerating.",

That ’ s up 40 % year over year . I think it ’ s up 22 % quarter over quarter. ” Google “ We ’ ve been supply constrained even as we ’ ve been ramping up our capacity. ” “ Backlog grew by 55 % quarter over quarter to $ 240 billion representing a wide breadth of customers driven by demand for AI products. ” “ Today more than 120000 enterprises use Gemini… ” Microsoft “ Our customer demand continues to exceed our supply. ” “ We ’ re working as hard as we can to add capacity as quickly as we can… we need to make sure we ’ ve got power and land and facilities available. ” “ Github Copilot Pro Plus subs for individual devs increased 77 % quarter over quarter and all up now we have 4.7 million paid Copilot subscribers up 75 % year over year. ” Commercial backlog remaining performance obligation continues to be reported net of reserves increased to $ 625 billion . And was up 11 % year over year with a weighted average duration of approximately two and a half years. ” Meta “ On your first question we do continue to be capacity constrained. ” “ Anticipate 2026 capital expenditures… to be in the range of $ 115 to $ 135 billion with yearoveryear growth driven by increased investment to support our Meta Superintelligence Labs efforts and core business. ” “ I would say that we think that there is room for our larger models to benefit from having more compute. ” Meanwhile Reddit users with $ 500 invested in stocks while working at a McDonalds confidently claim No_AI demand AI demand is fake businesses dont find value in AI AI slop this and that but Michael Burry said no_one is making any money from AI AI has no_moat AI has no_business model but circular economy its just a collusion to keep the AI bubble going When are people finally going to realize that the huge CapEx is almost entirely due to real AI demand Not_only that but models continue to get smarter faster .

      "selftext": "My first trading account was set up and funded LITERALLY as the '08 financial crisis crash was beginning. I was so excited to trade I literally unloaded all my funds into stocks within a couple of days to weeks. The chart now doesn't look dramatic but you don't know what it's like to watch your portfolio literally melt away to nothing during a real crash. I'm not talking to the 0dte yolo crowd. I'm talking trying to invest for real. And there was no V. It rook a long time to build back up with all the bear markets and Covid in there to just continue the smack downs. When I speak to my dad who was doing the same during the '87 crash it sounds even worse than anything any of us have experienced. I was also watching him and stocks for real during the dotcom bubble bursting. But again look at the chart and it looks like a blip. All crashes are blips in the long run. It's been said a million times but take it from someone who has been there: \\- The most important thing is DO NOT PANIC. You WILL make irrational choices when you let your emotions get out of check. I know. \\- Along with having a clear controlled mind, have a game plan and STICK to it. More often than not you had the right idea and you should see it through. If it means a stop limit then put in that stop and don't remove it. If you were going to DCA in increments then do just that. If you were swing trading and hit your goal then put in that trailing stop! Make money...Preserve capital. \\-This too shall pass. The market has seen a Great Depression and many recessions and flash crashes and bear markets. They all end. And if they don't then money isn't gonna help where we're all going! \\- It bears repeating to never be fully invested. Never be fully leveraged. Temper your exuberance during the good times so you can add on during the low times. \\- The hardest thing is selling during a bull market and buying during a bear market. Successful traders and the \"big boys\" do this successfully. Retail does not. \\- I hate the term time in market but damn it it's true. But if you're buying quality stocks when the market turns down you will be rewarded eventually. \\- If you aren't buying and you aren't selling then turn it off. If you have decided to ride out the storm with what you have and just want to wait for the recovery then stop staring at the screen for 7 hours a day. Mental health is an important part of successful trading. \\- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems. The world is not ending though people have thought as much stretching back till early civilization. The world is also not some Garden of Eden Shangri-La. Approach the market with that mentality. \\- Investing is for attaining wealth and financial independence. It is not a get rich quick scheme and unfortunately many new traders in the markets see it as an extension of Draft Kings. Be smart. educate yourself. Use the tax shelters available to everyone. Plan for the future because it sure comes much quicker than you expected. This could be the big one and we'll see the Dow back at 30k...TSLA will go to 80...all big tech obliterated. Wall Street burns as the angry villagers descend on it with pitchforks. Lives are ruined. Bread lines instead of new iPhone drop lines. If I had to guess tho we'll be fine....as we always are. Don't freak out especially if you want to have a long career investing. And you should. It's one way the little man can make any money without inheriting millions from a rich family member. And if all else fails... a few 0dte calls on 3x ETFs couldn't hurt...right? Just for funsies?",

      "selftext_processed": "My first trading account was set up and funded LITERALLY as the 08 financial crisis crash was beginning . I was so excited to trade I literally unloaded all my funds into stocks within a couple of days to weeks . The chart now doesnt look dramatic but you dont know what its like to watch your portfolio literally melt away to nothing_during a real crash . Im not_talking to the 0dte yolo crowd . Im talking trying to invest for real . And there was no_V . It rook a long time to build back up with all the bear markets and Covid in there to just continue the smack downs . When I speak to my dad who was doing the same during the 87 crash it sounds even worse than anything any of us have experienced . I was also watching him and stocks for real during the dotcom bubble bursting . But again look at the chart and it looks like a blip . All crashes are blips in the long run . Its been said a million times but take it from someone who has been there The most important thing is DO NOT_PANIC . You WILL make irrational choices when you let your emotions get out of check . I know . Along with having a clear controlled mind have a game plan and STICK to it . More often than not_you had the right idea and you should see it through . If it means a stop limit then put in that stop and dont remove it . If you were going to DCA in increments then do just that . If you were swing trading and hit your goal then put in that trailing stop Make money ... Preserve capital . This too shall pass . The market has seen a Great Depression and many recessions and flash crashes and bear markets . They all end . And if they dont then money isnt gon na help where were all going It bears repeating to never_be fully invested . Never_be fully leveraged . Temper your exuberance during the good times so you can add on during the low times . The hardest thing is selling during a bull market and buying during a bear market . Successful traders and the big boys do this successfully . Retail does not_ I hate the term time in market but damn it its true . But if youre buying quality stocks when the market turns down you will be rewarded eventually . If you arent buying and you arent selling then turn it off . If you have decided to ride out the storm with what you have and just want to wait for the recovery then stop staring at the screen for 7 hours a day . Mental health is an important part of successful trading . Nothing_is as good or as bad as it seems . The world is not_ending though people have thought as much stretching back till early civilization . The world is also not_some Garden of Eden ShangriLa . Approach the market with that mentality . Investing is for attaining wealth and financial independence . It is not_a get rich quick scheme and unfortunately many new traders in the markets see it as an extension of Draft Kings . Be smart . educate yourself . Use the tax shelters available to everyone . Plan for the future because it sure comes much quicker than you expected . This could be the big one and well see the Dow back at 30k ... TSLA will go to 80 ... all big tech obliterated . Wall Street burns as the angry villagers descend on it with pitchforks . Lives are ruined . Bread lines instead of new iPhone drop lines . If I had to guess tho well be fine .... as we always are . Dont freak out especially if you want to have a long career investing . And you should . Its one way the little man can make any money without inheriting millions from a rich family member . And if all else fails ... a few 0dte calls on 3x ETFs couldnt hurt ... right Just for funsies"

I had \\~34k in it before the current slide, it’s now around 31k. I probably don’t need this money for a while since husband is putting in company HSA account for immediate expenses and he also has about 33k of invested HSA. Few days before the MSFT earning, I sold around 25k worth of FZROX, I invested 9k in FSPGX, some in FSELX the next day. I have about 11k uninvested. My plan was to invest in more aggressive funds, thus the sell. Within few days market has changed a lot. So my question is: do you think it makes sense to add some individual stocks? I don’t want to be rash and invest in speculative stocks. I am really considering some software stocks that are already mainstream but have gone down a lot. Sofi, Pltr, Msft, Rddt, Amazon, lam research. I don’t have much, but want to spread the 11k among few stocks. Do you think it is a good idea? Anyone who has done this, have you regretted? Any stock you think would be great in the list? please no speculative stocks. TIA!",

And in addition every article seems to call it a 1.5 billion dollar acquisition, but they are also creating over 4 million new shares so it ends up being closer to a 3 billion dollar purchase at their current price and diluting their current share holders by 16% Ik they had an earnings beat, but seems over bought and they’re going full hopium on data center buildout to keep its current pace for years. Regulatory wise they are gonna argue it’s not a direct competitor due to the MEMS vs quartz difference, and monopolies don’t exist anymore anyways, so probably no issue there. Their earnings were literally the same for 2022, both years around 82-83 million, yet at its peak it was $100 less back then. The dollar is weaker than it was, but not 33% weaker This deal won’t even go through till EOY 2026 at the soonest according to them. Also Renesas says this is for them to focus on their “core business” of making chips, and a certain penny stock going to ruin (dog speed) probably had them looking for cash, but if their timing business is set to generate $300 million at a 70% margins, and its growth prospects are as strong as SiTime claims, why would they sell it. Renesas had a net loss this year of $347 million, and then they sell a division that will do $210 million in profit next year. Probably cause SiTime is over paying for it And take a look at the insider transactions, literally all selling Anyways idk I bought $400 3/20 puts",

Regulatory wise they are gon na argue it ’ s not_a direct competitor due to the MEMS vs quartz difference and monopolies don ’ t exist anymore anyways so probably no_issue there . Their earnings were literally the same for 2022 both years around 8283 million yet at its peak it was $ 100 less back then . The dollar is weaker than it was but not_33 % weaker This deal won ’ t even go through till EOY 2026 at the soonest according to them . Also Renesas says this is for them to focus on their “ core business ” of making chips and a certain penny stock going to ruin dog speed probably had them looking for cash but if their timing business is set to generate $ 300 million at a 70 % margins and its growth prospects are as strong as SiTime claims why would they sell it . Renesas had a net loss this year of $ 347 million and then they sell a division that will do $ 210 million in profit next year . Probably cause SiTime is over paying for it And take a look at the insider transactions literally all selling Anyways idk I bought $ 400 320 puts"

      "selftext": "I was watching youtube video from MeetKevin recently and he pulled up jpmorgan and goldmansachs research reports on the state of the market. I wanted to read them myself so I search their websites, research sections, etc and the exact title of the reports on google but just could not find these reports. They are in pdf format and one of the titles was \"2026 YEAR-AHEAD JPM RESEARCH OUTLOOK COMPENDIUM\" I have a feeling they are part of premium content behind a paywall at jpmorgan/goldman. Im wondering if there is a way to find these? because they dont appear to be listed on the websites freely. I recently came across a website called alpha-sense which claims to be a research portal containing thousands of premium business content like broker research and think maybe they'd have it and are an aggregator for these kinds of reports but of course its behind a paywall. im ok with paying (free would be nice 🙂) but this site is b2b and doesnt list a price so theres so way I could afford a subscription lol. Hoping someone here with some insight could point me in the right direction. thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "I was watching youtube video from MeetKevin recently and he pulled up jpmorgan and goldmansachs research reports on the state of the market . I wanted to read them myself so I search their websites research sections etc and the exact title of the reports on google but just could not_find these reports . They are in pdf format and one of the titles was 2026 YEARAHEAD JPM RESEARCH OUTLOOK COMPENDIUM I have a feeling they are part of premium content behind a paywall at jpmorgangoldman . Im wondering if there is a way to find these because they dont appear to be listed on the websites freely . I recently came across a website called alphasense which claims to be a research portal containing thousands of premium business content like broker research and think maybe theyd have it and are an aggregator for these kinds of reports but of course its behind a paywall . im ok with paying free would be nice 🙂 but this site is b2b and doesnt list a price so theres so way I could afford a subscription lol . Hoping someone here with some insight could point me in the right direction . thanks"

      "selftext": "Carvana (CVNA) is an internet based automotive retail company that has been knocked 22% off its lofty January heights, but remains tremendously overvalued compared to its segment competitors (Carmax, Autonation, Lithia). Carvana also came under fire last month after a short seller report by Gotham City Capital questioning their sub-prime lending and accounting practices. Now CVNA has given off a strongly Bearish technical signal as it's 20 day EMA crossed its 50 day SMA in what is often called a \"Bear Cross\" or a \"Death Cross.\" (Can I say that here? Do I have to write Unalive Cross?) I am the first to admit that technical analysis is about as accurate as tarot readings or Voodoo magic. However, the last 2 times CVNA's moving averages crossed like they did today the stock fell dramatically over the coming weeks. In March of 2025 CVNA went through a Bear Cross and fell from $220 to $162. In October 2025 CVNA fell from $357 to $285 after a Bear Cross. As of 4pm today (2/5/2026) CVNA traded at a lofty $383 a share, a significant drop off from their $490 peak after inclusion in the S&P500, but still a staggering 78 times their reported annual income. Between geopolitical turmoil, risk-off selling, the recent short seller report, and now this clearly bearish technical signal, it seems highly likely CVNA will continue their precipitous fall. As I have posted before, I have current open put option positions against CVNA and intend to continue to short CVNA stock for the immediate future. I may open or close other positions with no prior notice. Year to date this short trade is up over 34%, and I have no intention of letting off CVNA until their market cap approaches a more appropriate enterprise value. I am not a Financial Advisor. This is not Financial advice. I am a 14 yr automotive veteran and a 15 year stock and options retail trader. Thanks for reading BFLO-Retail [ [ [ [",

      "title": "I built a portfolio on \"Realpolitik, Futurism & Commodities.\" One week in, and I am down 10%. Is it bad strategy, or is it just bad timing?",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m fairly new to investing in ETFs (started last week lol). No knowledge of economics or finance other than trading crypto. Instead of just dumping everything into VOO and chilling, I decided to do some \"brainstorming\" with Gemini. I described my vision, and it helped me pick the ETFs. After a few days of browsing the market, I locked-in. Basically, I devised a portfolio strategy based on what I thought were three solid long-term pillars: 1. **Realpolitik:** Betting on specific regions (Poland, Turkey, Korea, \"Ex-China\" Emerging Markets) based on shifting geopolitical blocs. 2. **Futurism:** Betting on the inevitable rise of AI, robotics, space, and nuclear energy. 3. **Commodities:** Hedges against inflation and betting on the raw materials needed for the tech boom (Copper, Uranium, Rare Earths, Silver). My philosophy is simple: The world is changing, and my portfolio is going to reflect exactly that. I divided the portfolio among the rising powers, the tech that will shape our near-future, and the materials that will build that future. **The Result:** While I still think my thinking is not so flawed, my \"mind child\" has had a rough start. Almost every single position is in the red, and my \"inflation hedges\" (Commodities) are actually hitting me the hardest. Here is my portfolio breakdown, organized by my original allocation (bet size) before the losses started piling up: **The \"Safe\" Foundation** * **VEA** (7.3% Alloc | -0.81% Loss): Developed markets (Europe/Pacific). * **VOO** (7.0% Alloc | -3.03% Loss): S&P 500. **Geopolitical Bets** * **EMXC** (14.6% Alloc | -0.66% Loss): Emerging Markets ex-China. * **EWY** (3.7% Alloc | -7.82% Loss): South Korea. * **EPOL** (3.7% Alloc | -3.93% Loss): Poland. * **TUR** (3.6% Alloc | -1.43% Loss): Turkey. **Futuristic Tech & Defense** * **SOXX** (9.1% Alloc | -9.90% Loss): Semiconductors. * **ROKT** (7.6% Alloc | -9.11% Loss): Space & Deep Sea. * **EUAD** (5.5% Alloc | -7.32% Loss): European Aerospace & Defense. * **XBI** (3.6% Alloc | -5.28% Loss): Biotech. * **NUKZ** (2.0% Alloc | -5.07% Loss): Nuclear Energy. * **ARKQ** (1.6% Alloc | -7.83% Loss): Robotics & AI. **Metals & Commodities (The Pain Zone)** * **URA** (11.7% Alloc | -20.15% Loss): Uranium. * **COPX** (6.8% Alloc | -16.45% Loss): Copper Miners. * **SLV** (5.1% Alloc | -36.42% Loss): Silver. * **SPPP** (5.1% Alloc | -25.28% Loss): Platinum/Palladium. * **REMX** (1.8% Alloc | -19.97% Loss): Rare Earth Elements. **My Question to You:** Is my strategy fundamentally flawed, or is this just terrible timing? Especially seeing my high-conviction plays like Uranium and Silver drop 20-30% has been a bad start. * Did I overdiversify into too many niche ETFs? * Is the \"Commodity Supercycle\" thesis dead? * Should I cut my losses on the heavy bleeders (SLV, URA) and consolidate into the broad market, or is this exactly the time I should be buying more if I believe in the thesis? Any honest feedback is appreciated. I will use it to improve my reasoning, and maybe my portfolio. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ m fairly new to investing in ETFs started last week lol . No_knowledge of economics or finance other than trading crypto . Instead of just dumping everything into VOO and chilling I decided to do some brainstorming with Gemini . I described my vision and it helped me pick the ETFs . After a few days of browsing the market I lockedin . Basically I devised a portfolio strategy based on what I thought were three solid longterm pillars 1 . Realpolitik Betting on specific regions Poland Turkey Korea ExChina Emerging Markets based on shifting geopolitical blocs . 2 . Futurism Betting on the inevitable rise of AI robotics space and nuclear energy . 3. Commodities Hedges against inflation and betting on the raw materials needed for the tech boom Copper Uranium Rare Earths Silver . My philosophy is simple The world is changing and my portfolio is going to reflect exactly that . I divided the portfolio among the rising powers the tech that will shape our nearfuture and the materials that will build that future . The Result While I still think my thinking is not_so flawed my mind child has had a rough start . Almost every single position is in the red and my inflation hedges Commodities are actually hitting me the hardest . Here is my portfolio breakdown organized by my original allocation bet size before the losses started piling up The Safe Foundation VEA 7.3 % Alloc 0.81 % Loss Developed markets EuropePacific . VOO 7.0 % Alloc 3.03 % Loss SP 500 . Geopolitical Bets EMXC 14.6 % Alloc 0.66 % Loss Emerging Markets exChina . EWY 3.7 % Alloc 7.82 % Loss South Korea . EPOL 3.7 % Alloc 3.93 % Loss Poland . TUR 3.6 % Alloc 1.43 % Loss Turkey . Futuristic Tech Defense SOXX 9.1 % Alloc 9.90 % Loss Semiconductors . ROKT 7.6 % Alloc 9.11 % Loss Space Deep Sea . EUAD 5.5 % Alloc 7.32 % Loss European Aerospace Defense . XBI 3.6 % Alloc 5.28 % Loss Biotech . NUKZ 2.0 % Alloc 5.07 % Loss Nuclear Energy . ARKQ 1.6 % Alloc 7.83 % Loss Robotics AI . Metals Commodities The Pain Zone URA 11.7 % Alloc 20.15 % Loss Uranium . COPX 6.8 % Alloc 16.45 % Loss Copper Miners . SLV 5.1 % Alloc 36.42 % Loss Silver . SPPP 5.1 % Alloc 25.28 % Loss PlatinumPalladium . REMX 1.8 % Alloc 19.97 % Loss Rare Earth Elements . My Question to You Is my strategy fundamentally flawed or is this just terrible timing Especially seeing my highconviction plays like Uranium and Silver drop 2030 % has been a bad start . Did I overdiversify into too many niche ETFs Is the Commodity Supercycle thesis dead Should I cut my losses on the heavy bleeders SLV URA and consolidate into the broad market or is this exactly the time I should be buying more if I believe in the thesis Any honest feedback is appreciated . I will use it to improve my reasoning and maybe my portfolio . Thanks"

XOM 2026 PE: 21 5y PEG: 1.92 META 2026 PE: 22 5y PEG: 1.2 Chevron 2026 PE: 26.3 5y PEG: 3.5 MSFT: 2026 PE: 22.9 5y PEG: 1.5855 Now let’s look at annual earnings. Chevron and Exonn both have seen a decline in annual earnings since 2022 oil peak. For Exonn annual earnings have almost HALVED while the stock price has gone UP. [ ]( Contrary to this, both META and MSFT have increased their earnings and revenue by 40%+ since 2022. [ ]( Even if we assume that oil prices go up and energy companies deserve a higher premium multiple. Both Exonn and Chevron are trading at historically high PEs excluding recessionary or negative earning periods. [ ]( [ ]( Lastly, even if we assume that Oil is a more reliable business and you will make better returns over long term with dividends, fact is MSFT returned 1000+% while XOM returned 700+% since the year 2000. Including dividends. Earnings predictability: now this is subjective, I would argue that global oil and gas usage will go down over time not just because of climate concerns but simply because global population growth is slowing. Barring Africa and parts of Asia almost every country in the world including India and China have less than 2.1 TFR rate. If we count in the fact that developing countries are not using oil as much as today’s developed countries did during their development the effect is even more profound. Pakistan for instance with a per capita much lower than US now has a widespread solar adoption because oil energy is more expensive than solar energy. Also, I won’t even talk about all the new supply coming online pushing the oil prices lower from guayana and potentially from Venezuela, Iran and Russia. That’s too unpredictable.",

Chevron and Exonn both have seen a decline in annual earnings since 2022 oil peak . For Exonn annual earnings have almost HALVED while the stock price has gone UP . Contrary to this both META and MSFT have increased their earnings and revenue by 40 % since 2022 . Even if we assume that oil prices go up and energy companies deserve a higher premium multiple . Both Exonn and Chevron are trading at historically high PEs excluding recessionary or negative earning periods . Lastly even if we assume that Oil is a more reliable business and you will make better returns over long term with dividends fact is MSFT returned 1000 % while XOM returned 700 % since the year 2000 . Including dividends . Earnings predictability now this is subjective I would argue that global oil and gas usage will go down over time not_just because of climate concerns but simply because global population growth is slowing . Barring Africa and parts of Asia almost every country in the world including India and China have less than 2.1 TFR rate . If we count in the fact that developing countries are not_using oil as much as today ’ s developed countries did during their development the effect is even more profound . Pakistan for instance with a per capita much lower than US now has a widespread solar adoption because oil energy is more expensive than solar energy . Also I won ’ t even talk about all the new supply coming online pushing the oil prices lower from guayana and potentially from Venezuela Iran and Russia . That ’ s too unpredictable ."

      "selftext": "I've been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me. I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears, comments about AI being useless, and others saying its revolutionary. **The Fears:** **Seat Compression:** Less licenses, less money. **Commoditization of Code:** Code is cheap, \"Lowering the MOAT\". **Economic Displacement**: White collar jobs are replaced by software. **Types of SaaS:** Systems of Engagement - DOCU, ZM Systems of Record - CRM, NOW WKDY Cybersecurity - PANW, CRWD, NET, ZS Infrastructure & Data - SNOW, DDOG, MGDB Specialty - SNPS, CDNS, SAP, CSU, VEEV, INTU DevOps - TEAM, GTLB Hyper Scalars: Google, Meta, Amazon, Microsoft (All down like 20% +) **My thoughts:** I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard. My wife has a small business and for payroll there aren't a lot of great options outside of intuit. **Commoditization of code**: was what I found to be the most prevalent \"disruptor\" to Intuit. For example, if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts, and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit. There is also some fear of an AI advisor, but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best. While I was working through this case study with Gemini, it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk. It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and aren't going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company. If giants won't enter this space what about the small guys? A small scrappy start up? Does AI make VC money so much more efficient that they can bust into highly established business processes or highly regulated markets? Are they so much more efficient now, that the business's weren't worth pursuing before? What is that multiple? A team of developers needs to be 10-15x more efficient so 100M stretches to 500M in salary output of the past? Are you going to outcompete the established teams with moats of money? You are always going to have overhead with these startups, cloud hosting, security, snow, ddog, you name it. Half of these **\"seat compressions\"** will be filled with the competitors trying to disrupt the kings. AI hasn't \"changed software\", it still does the same thing. Startups don't have some implied advantage because the game has changed. They can just work faster now like everyone else. There are some fun inferences you can make with AI and the logic you can build around it but functionally the results are the same. One last thing. The earnings reports have all been pretty incredible. Google's CEO during his earnings call even reiterated bullishness on SaaS companies. If this were structural I would be more concerned, but the capex spend is reinforcing the narrative software is growing. The chip companies are still falling despite record spend. I have DCA'd half of my assets into software names over the last 3 days. I will continue to add the rest over the next week or two as things shake out. I am spread across most of the names. The safest bets for those who are risk adverse are SNPS, CDNS (duopoly in chip software/analysis/QA) and Cyber Security as vibe coders deploy exploits i guess? Do your own research and be patient.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been a software engineer for 14 years now and have been through a lot of iterations of software over my time and AI has been one of the most fun and exciting revolutions in recent history for me . I have been reflecting on it as of late due to the market fears comments about AI being useless and others saying its revolutionary . The Fears Seat Compression Less licenses less money . Commoditization of Code Code is cheap Lowering the MOAT . Economic Displacement White collar jobs are replaced by software . Types of SaaS Systems of Engagement DOCU ZM Systems of Record CRM NOW WKDY Cybersecurity PANW CRWD NET ZS Infrastructure Data SNOW DDOG MGDB Specialty SNPS CDNS SAP CSU VEEV INTU DevOps TEAM GTLB Hyper Scalars Google Meta Amazon Microsoft All down like 20 % My thoughts I spent some time trying to understand why INTU in particular has been hit so hard . My wife has a small business and for payroll there arent a lot of great options outside of intuit . Commoditization of code was what I found to be the most prevalent disruptor to Intuit . For example if Google or a startup could link into your bank accounts and agentically pull your banking records and automatically compute payroll or expenses it would remove the need for Intuit . There is also some fear of an AI advisor but an AI advisor that is bound by any real responsibility is questionable at best . While I was working through this case study with Gemini it pointed out Google could do this at some point but it would incur fiduciary responsibility and lawsuit risk . It dawned on me and its been true for the last 10 years . Google Amazon Microsoft and these other tech giants have hoards of the best software engineers for the last 20 years and arent going to start entering an accounting space for a 100B dollar market cap company . If giants wont enter this space what about the small guys A small scrappy start up Does AI make VC money so much more efficient that they can bust into highly established business processes or highly regulated markets Are they so much more efficient now that the businesss werent worth pursuing before What is that multiple A team of developers needs to be 1015x more efficient so 100M stretches to 500M in salary output of the past Are you going to outcompete the established teams with moats of money You are always going to have overhead with these startups cloud hosting security snow ddog you name it . Half of these seat compressions will be filled with the competitors trying to disrupt the kings . AI hasnt changed software it still does the same thing . Startups dont have some implied advantage because the game has changed . They can just work faster now like everyone else . There are some fun inferences you can make with AI and the logic you can build around it but functionally the results are the same . One last thing . The earnings reports have all been pretty incredible . Googles CEO during his earnings call even reiterated bullishness on SaaS companies . If this were structural I would be more concerned but the capex spend is reinforcing the narrative software is growing . The chip companies are still falling despite record spend . I have DCAd half of my assets into software names over the last 3 days . I will continue to add the rest over the next week or two as things shake out . I am spread across most of the names . The safest bets for those who are risk adverse are SNPS CDNS duopoly in chip softwareanalysisQA and Cyber Security as vibe coders deploy exploits i guess Do your own research and be patient ."

Also as of right now USD is up DXY.NYB USDEUR USDJPY USDGBP USDAUD and USDNZD . FOR YOU BOND NUTS PLEASE CORRECT ME HERE For US primary bond inflows what I saw today was that about half of the competitive bids tendered were accepted for US1M and US2M . Total value is $ 200B for competitive bids today . Noncompetitive for those 2 day totaled $ 11B . Slightly more demand for the US1M than US2M but by $ 10B . That said the total value of the the US1M and US2M purchases today were $ 211B . Source For JP primary bond inflows of those tendered competitively for JP30Y today only 14 of those were accepted . For JP10Y 13 was accepted . Total value I dont have the noncompetitive figures for the JP bonds unfortunately still trying to figure that out . The total value of JP10Y and JP30Y purchases today were ¥2.5T or $ 16B . Source In advance I apologize for denoting these incorrectly . For EU primary bond inflows the total value of the EU2M EU1M and EU1Y purchases today were €3B or $ 3.5B . Source What I say below comes with the disclaimer of I am not_a Financial Advisor nor am I speculating on the future . Moving forward the flock to USD should give us some optimism for the US market . Although the Administration speaks of devaluing the USD its still a trusted currency . Also at the very least given todays picture it shows that the appreciation brought to you by US TBills is more attractive . I cant say who is buying but we can see that money is moving in that direction ."

The speed and severity of the collapse has retirees asking whether this represents a rare buying opportunity in precious metals or a warning sign that commodity exposure doesn't belong in retirement portfolios The irony?

The value is found in how these tools talk to everything else in the tech stack. Once a company is integrated into an ecosystem, the switching costs are astronomical. In SaaS, the margins are massive, their growth is holding steady, and despite the \"AI disruption\" narrative, the numbers aren't showing any evidence of slowing down due to AI.

      "selftext": "Hey all! I started trading about 3 weeks ago. I put about a month's pay into a trading account, as I felt confident that even if I lost it all, I could still make it back with relative ease. I was feeling good about it when after a few lucky trades I was up 10%, but then this week happened. I got caught up in online discussion and put about 75% of my money in IREN. I bought around 51$ and sold at 57$ - **but the line kept going up.** This is where I got scared and got back in, exactly when I shouldn't have. We all know what happened since. Now, in such a case, is it wiser to cut your losses and head for the hills or is waiting out a viable option? There's never a guarantee for a bounceback, but also there's no guarantee that I could make back such a loss step by step, trade by trade. I know this answer varies from one stock to another, but **I'm just curious to hear any kind of input from more experienced traders out there**. What are your thoughts on the matter?",

I don't know anything, it seems likely there will be more blood tomorrow but my fundamental belief in MSFT, GOOGL, RKLB and yes even PLTR remains intact, they are still printing money (not RKLB I suppose) and I'm sorry but you have always had to spend money to make money so I'm buying the dip...just a little at a time. If you're buying when everyone else is panicking you're doing what everyone SAID they would do but never follow through. Buy from pessimists, sell to optimists.",

I dont know anything it seems likely there will be more blood tomorrow but my fundamental belief in MSFT GOOGL RKLB and yes even PLTR remains intact they are still printing money not RKLB I suppose and Im sorry but you have always had to spend money to make money so Im buying the dip ... just a little at a time .

If we take SPY for example, and say it was at $700 (I chose that for a round number; I know it's in the 670's) in 15 years, it'll be getting close to $3,000. I know inflation will continue to rise, but it seems crazy to me that the value of SPY in 15 years could be $3,000. Would love to hear some thoughts on this.",

It worked for some days but then it seemed like a bull trap so I went in again more aggressively . Question is 1 When do i exit what is our bottom level . If it runs to 6500 we are talking about 500k homerun 2 What do I buy with the profit everything seems like its in obscure discount ngl 3 Does that make me a ghay bear I am used to being a greedy power bull .

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, My knowledge of investing is very limited and I'm humbly asking for some insight or help with a stock I purchased in December of 2023. Also, I know chase is terrible for a self directed account, I plan on moving everything to a different bank soon. In Dec 2023, I bought 108 Shares of SAVE (Spirit Airlines) stock for $15.16 a share, for a total of $1637.27. I bought these shares thinking the Spirit Airlines and JetBlue merger was going to be approved. Needless to say, it was not approved and the SAVE stock immediately tanked. I didn't touch the stock after that because I just didn't know what to do with it. Fast forward to Nov 2024, Spirit files for bankruptcy and the ticket changed from SAVE to SAVEQ per my monthly statements. SAVEQ stays on my monthly statements until Feb 2025 where it last appears with a value of $0.47 a share for a total of $50.76. SAVEQ no longer appears on my March 2025 statement. Full disclosure, I asked chatGPT how to handle this for my 2025 taxes and it said to call chase and make sure the stock is marked as a worthless secuirty and they should provide me with and 1099-B. I called chase and the rep said they could not neither of those things and I just had to work it out with my tax person. Is this true? Should I call and ask again? How should I proceed? Thank you to any guidance anyone can provide.",

I gave them a generous growth rate on their revenue drivers and maintained cost controls for their store expansion of 23/yr. my math coves out to $256 Billion, $310 Billion and $278 Billion for their valuations in scenarios where I played around with their drivers and capex led by store growth. in my base case, their share value should be at $631. I think their current trading at a high P/E of 52-53x compared to their 10-year average around 30-33x backs up what I’ve uncovered. long story short, the market has Costco incorrectly priced, and without correction, I expect them to trade flat for a few years until earnings and growth story normalize to their market cap. you can shame me, say “what about this?!” And point to their stock continuing to go higher, but at these valuations, their price will get hit the hardest on even a slight earnings miss.",

I gave them a generous growth rate on their revenue drivers and maintained cost controls for their store expansion of 23yr . my math coves out to $ 256 Billion $ 310 Billion and $ 278 Billion for their valuations in scenarios where I played around with their drivers and capex led by store growth . in my base case their share value should be at $ 631 . I think their current trading at a high PE of 5253x compared to their 10year average around 3033x backs up what I ’ ve uncovered . long story short the market has Costco incorrectly priced and without correction I expect them to trade flat for a few years until earnings and growth story normalize to their market cap . you can shame me say “ what about this ” And point to their stock continuing to go higher but at these valuations their price will get hit the hardest on even a slight earnings miss ."

      "selftext": "I’m surprised the stock is down 11 % today. Earnings did leave the majority of analysts adjusting the price targets downward and I guess the market being down severely is making the stock get extra punished. Earnings weren’t all bad though- you could make a case that they were in fact good and not bad. Overall I would say they were mixed. The number of daily active users increased but they fell 5 % in North America specifically and that’s where their most important users are located- in particular because they are the most valuable ones in that they provide the most profits from advertising. For such a long time - seven years to exact - $7 was the floor for this stock. If it ever went below that price it would get back over it within a few days. The stock is trading incredibly close to its historical all time low of $4.82 which it reached in 2018 and when that happened, it recovered to over $7 in a few weeks. Obviously software and tech stocks are being punished very hard these past few days. Could it be a trend that will keep on going? I doubt it. My guess is we will see a reversal in the next couple of weeks and when that happens, I imagine SNAP will get back over $6. For it to go to $7 again… I don’t know- maybe a few months? I could be very wrong. It’s perfectly possible it will stay lower than $7 for years. If indeed it makes it back to $7 within a few months then that’s 35 % gains from today. Q1 Earnings didn’t leave me thinking SNAP is a dying company. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m surprised the stock is down 11 % today . Earnings did leave the majority of analysts adjusting the price targets downward and I guess the market being down severely is making the stock get extra punished . Earnings weren ’ t all bad though you could make a case that they were in fact good and not_bad . Overall I would say they were mixed . The number of daily active users increased but they fell 5 % in North America specifically and that ’ s where their most important users are located in particular because they are the most valuable ones in that they provide the most profits from advertising . For such a long time seven years to exact $ 7 was the floor for this stock . If it ever went below that price it would get back over it within a few days . The stock is trading incredibly close to its historical all time low of $ 4.82 which it reached in 2018 and when that happened it recovered to over $ 7 in a few weeks . Obviously software and tech stocks are being punished very hard these past few days . Could it be a trend that will keep on going I doubt it . My guess is we will see a reversal in the next couple of weeks and when that happens I imagine SNAP will get back over $ 6 . For it to go to $ 7 again… I don ’ t know maybe a few months I could be very wrong . It ’ s perfectly possible it will stay lower than $ 7 for years . If indeed it makes it back to $ 7 within a few months then that ’ s 35 % gains from today . Q1 Earnings didn ’ t leave me thinking SNAP is a dying company . What do you guys think"

      "selftext": "Are you involuntarily celibate or unable to speak to women? Good. Match Group is the digital custodian of the modern male loneliness epidemic. There’s basically no industry more guaranteed than sex. From the Supreme Gentleman to your average pajeet, people are willing to die for this shit. Match Group has a chokehold on sex, with a 45% market share in dating apps, which are increasingly essential to modern relationships. The era of looksmax, promiscuity, hookups, hedonism, and polyamory has officially started, so how can you hedge your miserable existence? At a 7B valuation, It generated a staggering 1.2 billion dollars in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 and is currently forecasting that number to rise as high as 1.325 billion dollars by the end of 2026. With an EV of 10B, that’s 7x EV/EBITDA. PE is 12X, and P/FCF of 7X. Bargain numbers. So the business is failing right? Management is forecasting flat revenue for 2026. Frankly, even if revenue never grew again, 10B EV for 1.2B of reliable ebitda is undervalued by 30-50%. Revenue isn’t growing because broke boys stopped paying. Payers decreased 5% year over year. However, employed chuds picked up the slack with average amount spent going up 7%, leading to flat revenue. I attribute the current circumstances of MTCH directly to the K shaped economy: dating is a tertiary expense, and when young men are globally broke, one of the first expenses they cut is their dating app perks. *However,* this will eventually reverse. Not only will the K shaped economy slowly recover over time, but younger men will grow into better paying jobs, leading to more disposable income to spend with MTCH. Long 800 shares. TP EV/EBITDA of 10x, share price of \\~50 assuming current fundamentals.",

The era of looksmax promiscuity hookups hedonism and polyamory has officially started so how can you hedge your miserable existence At a 7B valuation It generated a staggering 1.2 billion dollars in adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2025 and is currently forecasting that number to rise as high as 1.325 billion dollars by the end of 2026 . With an EV of 10B that ’ s 7x EVEBITDA . PE is 12X and PFCF of 7X . Bargain numbers . So the business is failing right Management is forecasting flat revenue for 2026 . Frankly even if revenue never_grew again 10B EV for 1.2B of reliable ebitda is undervalued by 3050 % . Revenue isn ’ t growing because broke boys stopped paying . Payers decreased 5 % year over year . However employed chuds picked up the slack with average amount spent going up 7 % leading to flat revenue . I attribute the current circumstances of MTCH directly to the K shaped economy dating is a tertiary expense and when young men are globally broke one of the first expenses they cut is their dating app perks . However this will eventually reverse . Not_only will the K shaped economy slowly recover over time but younger men will grow into better paying jobs leading to more disposable income to spend with MTCH . Long 800 shares .

      "title": "Costco: SOLID Company BUT Expensive Stock. Why? Because Nothing Is Really 'New'",
      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Costco is a best-in-class, recession-resistant business, but nothing has changed enough to justify its current multiple given long-term growth still looks \\~9–10% going forward. **Nothing new.** What Costco Does Right: Costco can take a 34% reduction in merchandise revenue before they move negative. Their weighted average cost of debt is 1.7-1.8% Their Interest income on their **$16Bil cash reserves** exceeds their interest expense on leases and senior notes Membership fee revenues (>90% retention annually) pay for 23% of their fixed costs Proven pricing realization as merchandise costs increase Growing new RMN revenue stream with high profit margins Costco has very good cost control in a bad economy. I say this because of the subtle recession fears that are cropping up in few but notable places. Areas of concern like: job market pessimism, creeping unemployment rates, drop in consumer sentiment and sustained inflation due, in part, to tariffs, although, mostly attributable to monetary expansion. Through it all, Costco has great pricing authority, very few competitors and a deep focus in a sector that they uniquely have a pulse on. I would argue that they have a unique product mix that captures sales volume shift from grocers like \"Whole foods\" and traditional retailer outfits particularly in the apparel space. Costco also has an incredibly diverse consumer base. They can capture sales from small businesses like restauranteurs, convenience stores, high-income and middle-income households. Looking at their revenue performance between 2007 to 2012, you'll see they vaguely experienced any adverse economic consequences in our peak recession years 2008-2010. So what *could* cause Costco to hurt? If they fail to respond to merchandise costs in a timely manner and their pricing doesn't track in times of higher inflation or deflation (less likely), their already thin gross margins can compress further or their revenue (less sensitive) could decline due to slow tracking. **Demographic shifts** can also cause harm. As it is, Costco's growth is unitary and very linear. Adding square footage and store openings are essential for their growth. Growth is directly tied to their stock's performance. This is a small fear as Costco rarely develops into areas where the future is unknown. They look to real estate values, property mix, consumer behaviors tied to those demographics; etc. Any area could experience a population decline, but their growth model hinges tightly to areas with slow drift. **As for their share price**, **you can make an argument for them being extremely expensive compared to their historical P/E ratios. No new developments or clues left by their executives hint at anything vastly innovative to warrant belief that their revenue growth will suddenly break beyond their average of 9-10%.** you can argue their added revenue streams, ecommerce, RMN and so forth, but these have not materially increased the projected future revenue growth above the 9-10% expectation nor are they expected to grow margins to a degree that support the higher share price. So, they are **expensive** based on what we can reasonably price in and the impact on free cash flow to investors. So from a Free cash flow perspective, accounting for new growth assumptions, we can say that their valuation is almost **twice as expensive as what it was**.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Costco is a bestinclass recessionresistant business but nothing_has changed enough to justify its current multiple given longterm growth still looks 9–10 % going forward . Nothing new . What Costco Does Right Costco can take a 34 % reduction in merchandise revenue before they move negative . Their weighted average cost of debt is 1.71.8 % Their Interest income on their $ 16Bil cash reserves exceeds their interest expense on leases and senior notes Membership fee revenues 90 % retention annually pay for 23 % of their fixed costs Proven pricing realization as merchandise costs increase Growing new RMN revenue stream with high profit margins Costco has very good cost control in a bad economy . I say this because of the subtle recession fears that are cropping up in few but notable places . Areas of concern like job market pessimism creeping unemployment rates drop in consumer sentiment and sustained inflation due in part to tariffs although mostly attributable to monetary expansion . Through it all Costco has great pricing authority very few competitors and a deep focus in a sector that they uniquely have a pulse on . I would argue that they have a unique product mix that captures sales volume shift from grocers like Whole foods and traditional retailer outfits particularly in the apparel space . Costco also has an incredibly diverse consumer base . They can capture sales from small businesses like restauranteurs convenience stores highincome and middleincome households . Looking at their revenue performance between 2007 to 2012 youll see they vaguely experienced any adverse economic consequences in our peak recession years 20082010 . So what could cause Costco to hurt If they fail to respond to merchandise costs in a timely manner and their pricing doesnt track in times of higher inflation or deflation less likely their already thin gross margins can compress further or their revenue less sensitive could decline due to slow tracking . Demographic shifts can also cause harm . As it is Costcos growth is unitary and very linear . Adding square footage and store openings are essential for their growth . Growth is directly tied to their stocks performance . This is a small fear as Costco rarely develops into areas where the future is unknown . They look to real estate values property mix consumer behaviors tied to those demographics etc . Any area could experience a population decline but their growth model hinges tightly to areas with slow drift . As for their share price you can make an argument for them being extremely expensive compared to their historical PE ratios . No_new developments or clues left by their executives hint at anything vastly innovative to warrant belief that their revenue growth will suddenly break beyond their average of 910 % . you can argue their added revenue streams ecommerce RMN and so forth but these have not_materially increased the projected future revenue growth above the 910 % expectation nor are they expected to grow margins to a degree that support the higher share price . So they are expensive based on what we can reasonably price in and the impact on free cash flow to investors . So from a Free cash flow perspective accounting for new growth assumptions we can say that their valuation is almost twice as expensive as what it was ."

      "title": "SNAP faces slowing advertising growth despite product innovation and cost restructuring",
      "selftext": "Snap Inc. (NYSE: SNAP) has experienced significant volatility over the past several years, currently trading in the mid-single to low-double digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles. The stock remains well below its historical highs, reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as company-specific challenges related to user monetization and competition. Snap originally gained traction as a fast-growing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging, augmented reality features, and a strong appeal among younger demographics. At its peak growth stage, the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobile-focused engagement tools. However, the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years, creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap’s business model. From a financial perspective, Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth. Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases. Advertising remains the company’s primary revenue driver, and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on top-line performance. Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries, creating additional volatility in Snap’s revenue trends. User growth has remained relatively stable, with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement, particularly among Gen Z demographics. However, investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth. Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta, TikTok, and emerging social video ecosystems. On the cost side, Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency. Over the past two years, the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions. Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenue-generating features. These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not fully offset revenue growth concerns. Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as long-term differentiation strategies. The company’s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms. Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising, creator partnerships, and interactive commerce experiences. While these technologies offer long-term potential, near-term revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption. Competitive pressure remains one of Snap’s most significant strategic challenges. Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics, targeting infrastructure, and cross-platform engagement. TikTok’s rapid expansion in short-form video and Meta’s continued investment in AI-driven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets. From a trading standpoint, SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements, macro advertising trends, and broader technology sector sentiment. Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles, followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics. Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases, indicating strong institutional and retail participation. Long-term strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company’s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics. The platform’s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets. Additionally, Snap’s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time. However, several risk factors remain. Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms. Additionally, continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing long-term innovation with near-term profitability expectations. From a valuation perspective, SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics. This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms. Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand. Overall, Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hyper-growth toward a more mature monetization and efficiency-focused phase. The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality, but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate. Not financial advice. This summary is based on publicly available filings, earnings reports, and industry analysis. Do you think Snap can improve advertising monetization while maintaining user engagement, or will competitive pressure continue to limit long-term growth potential?",

      "selftext_processed": "Snap Inc. NYSE SNAP has experienced significant volatility over the past several years currently trading in the midsingle to lowdouble digit range depending on market sentiment and earnings cycles . The stock remains well below its historical highs reflecting broader pressure across digital advertising platforms as well as companyspecific challenges related to user monetization and competition . Snap originally gained traction as a fastgrowing social media platform built around ephemeral messaging augmented reality features and a strong appeal among younger demographics . At its peak growth stage the company benefited from rapid user adoption and increasing advertiser demand for mobilefocused engagement tools . However the digital advertising landscape has changed significantly over the last few years creating both structural and cyclical challenges for Snap ’ s business model . From a financial perspective Snap has experienced periods of slowing revenue growth . Recent earnings reports have shown quarterly revenue growth that has moderated compared to earlier expansion phases . Advertising remains the company ’ s primary revenue driver and fluctuations in advertiser spending have had a direct impact on topline performance . Macroeconomic uncertainty has also influenced advertising budgets across multiple industries creating additional volatility in Snap ’ s revenue trends . User growth has remained relatively stable with Snap continuing to report strong daily active user engagement particularly among Gen Z demographics . However investor concerns increasingly focus on monetization efficiency rather than raw user growth . Average revenue per user has faced pressure as advertisers evaluate return on investment and shift budgets between competing platforms such as Meta TikTok and emerging social video ecosystems . On the cost side Snap has implemented multiple restructuring initiatives aimed at improving operating efficiency . Over the past two years the company reduced workforce size and consolidated several internal product divisions . Management has emphasized streamlining product development while prioritizing core revenuegenerating features . These cost reduction measures have improved operating discipline but have not_fully offset revenue growth concerns . Snap has continued to invest heavily in augmented reality and artificial intelligence capabilities as longterm differentiation strategies . The company ’ s AR lens ecosystem and creator tools remain among the most advanced within social media platforms . Snap has positioned these tools as future monetization channels through branded AR advertising creator partnerships and interactive commerce experiences . While these technologies offer longterm potential nearterm revenue contribution remains uncertain and dependent on advertiser adoption . Competitive pressure remains one of Snap ’ s most significant strategic challenges . Larger platforms with broader user ecosystems benefit from scale advantages in advertising analytics targeting infrastructure and crossplatform engagement . TikTok ’ s rapid expansion in shortform video and Meta ’ s continued investment in AIdriven ad targeting have intensified competition for user attention and advertiser budgets . From a trading standpoint SNAP has demonstrated elevated volatility around earnings announcements macro advertising trends and broader technology sector sentiment . Technical patterns have shown repeated testing of support levels during weaker advertising cycles followed by sharp rallies during periods of improved guidance or stronger user engagement metrics . Trading volume often increases significantly during earnings releases indicating strong institutional and retail participation . Longterm strategic outlook for Snap largely depends on the company ’ s ability to improve advertising monetization while maintaining strong user engagement among younger demographics . The platform ’ s brand identity and cultural relevance remain valuable intangible assets . Additionally Snap ’ s early leadership in AR technology may provide strategic optionality if immersive digital advertising and social commerce adoption accelerate over time . However several risk factors remain . Advertising spending remains highly cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions . Competition for digital advertising share continues to intensify across social media platforms . Additionally continued investment in emerging technologies requires balancing longterm innovation with nearterm profitability expectations . From a valuation perspective SNAP often trades based on forward growth expectations rather than current profitability metrics . This dynamic contributes to higher volatility relative to more mature advertising platforms . Investor sentiment tends to shift rapidly based on revenue growth trajectories and management guidance regarding advertiser demand . Overall Snap represents a technology platform transitioning from early hypergrowth toward a more mature monetization and efficiencyfocused phase . The company retains strong brand recognition and technological differentiation in augmented reality but its ability to translate engagement into sustainable advertising revenue remains the central investment debate . Not_financial advice . This summary is based on publicly available filings earnings reports and industry analysis . Do you think Snap can improve advertising monetization while maintaining user engagement or will competitive pressure continue to limit longterm growth potential"

It seems like when I watch Bloomberg, most of the interviews that ask about the AI and software stocks keep saying that it is far too oversold and far too overexaggerated. Mandeep Singh from Bloomberg Intelligence also reiterated the exact same thing yesterday saying that enterprises are unlikely to rewrite code for existing software that works very well already. For example, if your workplace uses Zoom, Slack, Teams, WebEx, a company is unlikely going to rebuild a corporate level messaging system or even a Microsoft Office copy from scratch in-house to replace their enterprise software. I personally think this sell off is a result of overleverage and excessive risk taking resulting in margin calls and panic selling. That's also mixed in with previously high valuations before earnings could actually catch up. Given that it's been 3 months since the ATH made in late October and has corrected \\~10% on major US tech ETFs (XLK, IYW), it might be nearing the end of this sell off in a matter of days to weeks.

I found a court case in LA (25STCP00746) where the PE firm is getting sued for 50% ownership of the main factory. Seems sketchy hiding a $200M lawsuit and then how much stock Neos is selling day 1 ​Has anyone else looked at this? It seems like they are selling shares while the judge denied their dismissal motion in November. Just trying to figure out if this is standard for PE roll-ups or if it's a major risk I should worry about before buying. Thanks TLDR 1. Private equity firm (Neos) buys MGM transformers for $400M. 2. One of the family members who owned MGM shows up and says 'Hey, I own half of that and you sold it without telling me.' 3. Neos says 'Whoops, didn't check.' (Extremely sus) 4. Judge denies Neos dismissal, (says it looks real) 90% of the time when this happens it gets settled privately 5. PE Firm immediately buys up 3 other much smaller companies, changes their name to sound more like tech/AI, and lists company on stock market to sell their shares to us before the trial starts",

I found a court case in LA 25STCP00746 where the PE firm is getting sued for 50 % ownership of the main factory . Seems sketchy hiding a $ 200M lawsuit and then how much stock Neos is selling day 1 ​Has anyone else looked at this It seems like they are selling shares while the judge denied their dismissal motion in November . Just trying to figure out if this is standard for PE rollups or if its a major risk I should worry about before buying . Thanks TLDR 1 . Private equity firm Neos buys MGM transformers for $ 400M . 2 . One of the family members who owned MGM shows up and says Hey I own half of that and you sold it without telling me . 3 . Neos says Whoops didnt check . Extremely sus 4 . Judge denies Neos dismissal says it looks real 90 % of the time when this happens it gets settled privately 5 . PE Firm immediately buys up 3 other much smaller companies changes their name to sound more like techAI and lists company on stock market to sell their shares to us before the trial starts"

      "selftext": "European central banks are holding rates steady even as inflation continues to cool, signaling a preference for caution over speed. Both the ECB and the Bank of England appear focused on labor market dynamics and second-round inflation risks rather than headline CPI alone. Seems the result is a policy pause that keeps financial conditions tight despite improving data. [European Central Banks Hold Rates Despite Cooling Inflation | Sandmark]( What stands out to me isn’t that they’re holding rates, it’s *why*. This feels less about the current inflation prints and more about protecting institutional credibility after years of being accused of reacting too late. From that perspective, waiting too long is a reputationally safer mistake than cutting early and having to reverse course. It leaves markets in limbo, but it’s consistent with how central banks tend to manage risk when trust is the real constraint. Curious how others take it?",

Both the ECB and the Bank of England appear focused on labor market dynamics and secondround inflation risks rather than headline CPI alone . Seems the result is a policy pause that keeps financial conditions tight despite improving data . European Central Banks Hold Rates Despite Cooling Inflation Sandmark What stands out to me isn ’ t that they ’ re holding rates it ’ s why . This feels less about the current inflation prints and more about protecting institutional credibility after years of being accused of reacting too late . From that perspective waiting too long is a reputationally safer mistake than cutting early and having to reverse course . It leaves markets in limbo but it ’ s consistent with how central banks tend to manage risk when trust is the real constraint . Curious how others take it"

      "selftext": "Here's the economic paradox investors need to understand: January saw 108,435 layoffs (highest since 2009), yet PMI data shows economic re-acceleration driving volume into cyclical sectors. How is this possible? The Warsh Efficiency Theory: Companies aren't cutting because demand is dead. PMI proves demand is strong. They're cutting bloat to implement AI and improve margins. This is productivity growth, not recession. The data: AI was explicitly cited as the reason for 7,624 cuts (7% of total). Companies are replacing low-productivity roles with automation, not reducing output. Market Implications: Yesterday's rotation reflects this. Money fled Tech/Semis (down 2-4%) into Industrial Blue Chips, Staples, Energy, Chemicals. The market is asking: \"If AI creates productivity, do I need to pay 30x sales for a SaaS company?\" Winners: • AI Infrastructure (efficiency enablers) • Automation/Robotics • Industrial productivity tools Losers: • Bloated cost structures • Labor-intensive, low-margin operations The Investment Thesis: Don't conflate layoffs with recession. Record January layoffs + strong PMIs = structural efficiency gains, not demand destruction. This is 2026's efficiency revolution, not 2008's demand collapse. Investors who understand this will position away from bloated cost structures, toward efficiency enablers and stable-margin defensives. Educational purposes only. Not financial advice.

How is this possible The Warsh Efficiency Theory Companies arent cutting because demand is dead . PMI proves demand is strong . Theyre cutting bloat to implement AI and improve margins . This is productivity growth not_recession . The data AI was explicitly cited as the reason for 7624 cuts 7 % of total . Companies are replacing lowproductivity roles with automation not_reducing output . Market Implications Yesterdays rotation reflects this . Money fled TechSemis down 24 % into Industrial Blue Chips Staples Energy Chemicals . The market is asking If AI creates productivity do I need to pay 30x sales for a SaaS company Winners • AI Infrastructure efficiency enablers • AutomationRobotics • Industrial productivity tools Losers • Bloated cost structures • Laborintensive lowmargin operations The Investment Thesis Dont conflate layoffs with recession . Record January layoffs strong PMIs structural efficiency gains not_demand destruction . This is 2026s efficiency revolution not_2008s demand collapse .

Approx PE Ratios NVDA: 44x AAPL: 34x MU: 35x CVNA: 93x Trading at almost 2 1/2 times the valuation of cutting-edge tech stocks seems insane. But when you factor in that Carvana‘s numbers may be inflated by backdoor dealings and risky subprime loans (according to a recent Short report by Gotham City) CVNA’s actual PE multiple might be closer to 900x.

      "title": "Korean Shipbuilders' Profits Triple, Near Super Cycle",
      "selftext": "HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, Hanwha Ocean, and Samsung Heavy Industries, the three major South Korean shipbuilders collectively reported an operating profit of 6 trillion Korean won last year. This marks nearly a threefold increase compared to 2024, with performance nearing the \"super cycle\" levels seen around 2010 during the global shipbuilding boom. According to industry sources on the 4th, the combined operating profit of the three companies reached 5.8758 trillion won last year, a 170.1% surge from 2.1747 trillion won in 2024. The trio achieved their first simultaneous profitability in 13 years in 2024, and profits grew sharply again last year. Sales also increased by 15.3% year-on-year to 53.2716 trillion won. This growth stems from the global recovery of the shipbuilding industry and the consecutive orders and deliveries of high-value vessels, including LNG (liquefied natural gas) carriers. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has been tightening environmental regulations, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 20% by 2030 compared to 2008 levels. This has led to an explosive global demand for eco-friendly vessel replacements. Korean shipyards, which hold a competitive edge over Chinese rivals in this sector, have benefited significantly. Additionally, the three companies’ order backlog stood at $124.42 billion (180.6918 trillion won) as of the end of last year. With enough work piled up for over 3–4 years, the industry anticipates that the three firms will maintain robust performance this year. Record-breaking results continued across the board. HD Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering, the mid-tier holding company of HD Hyundai’s shipbuilding division, reported an operating profit of 3.9045 trillion won last year, a 172.3% jump from the previous year, marking its highest ever. Hanwha Ocean saw its operating profit soar by 366.2% to 1.1091 trillion won. Samsung Heavy Industries recorded sales of 10.65 trillion won, re-entering the \"10 trillion won sales club\" for the first time in nine years. Its operating profit also rose by 71.5% year-on-year to 862.2 billion won. [",

      "selftext_processed": "HD Korea Shipbuilding Offshore Engineering Hanwha Ocean and Samsung Heavy Industries the three major South Korean shipbuilders collectively reported an operating profit of 6 trillion Korean won last year . This marks nearly a threefold increase compared to 2024 with performance nearing the super cycle levels seen around 2010 during the global shipbuilding boom . According to industry sources on the 4th the combined operating profit of the three companies reached 5.8758 trillion won last year a 170.1 % surge from 2.1747 trillion won in 2024 . The trio achieved their first simultaneous profitability in 13 years in 2024 and profits grew sharply again last year . Sales also increased by 15.3 % yearonyear to 53.2716 trillion won . This growth stems from the global recovery of the shipbuilding industry and the consecutive orders and deliveries of highvalue vessels including LNG liquefied natural gas carriers . The International Maritime Organization IMO has been tightening environmental regulations aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships by 20 % by 2030 compared to 2008 levels . This has led to an explosive global demand for ecofriendly vessel replacements . Korean shipyards which hold a competitive edge over Chinese rivals in this sector have benefited significantly . Additionally the three companies ’ order backlog stood at $ 124.42 billion 180.6918 trillion won as of the end of last year . With enough work piled up for over 3–4 years the industry anticipates that the three firms will maintain robust performance this year . Recordbreaking results continued across the board . HD Korea Shipbuilding Offshore Engineering the midtier holding company of HD Hyundai ’ s shipbuilding division reported an operating profit of 3.9045 trillion won last year a 172.3 % jump from the previous year marking its highest ever . Hanwha Ocean saw its operating profit soar by 366.2 % to 1.1091 trillion won . Samsung Heavy Industries recorded sales of 10.65 trillion won reentering the 10 trillion won sales club for the first time in nine years . Its operating profit also rose by 71.5 % yearonyear to 862.2 billion won ."

      "selftext": "One of the things that people have been complaining about is that the major indicies are at historic highs as far as the Price-to-Earnings ratio (P/E). So far this week all the major players who have high P/E's, they have all been reporting GREAT results, better earnings. But the stock price is falling so why is that good? Because the P/E is falling. If you missed GOOG last year it dropped to a P/E below 15 and people realized that was oversold. Currently MSFT is around 25 so maybe it falls further. So earnings are good and unemployment remains historically low (the recent challenger layoff report aside, I think what we are seeing is there are people in the workforce who have been waiting for layoffs and simply now retiring (read r/fire for more), that's why unemployment isn't rising. I have a friend who was thrilled when Bridgestone had major layoffs, he started another company years ago but was waiting for the big bag to officially leave). I'm not saying that the marketing is going to go straight up from here. February is historically a poor month. What I am saying is what everyone knows and yet everyone seems to find every excuse not to do: Buy Low, Sell High. This is an opportunity to buy, not sell.",

So far this week all the major players who have high PEs they have all been reporting GREAT results better earnings . But the stock price is falling so why is that good Because the PE is falling . If you missed GOOG last year it dropped to a PE below 15 and people realized that was oversold . Currently MSFT is around 25 so maybe it falls further . So earnings are good and unemployment remains historically low the recent challenger layoff report aside I think what we are seeing is there are people in the workforce who have been waiting for layoffs and simply now retiring read rfire for more thats why unemployment isnt rising . I have a friend who was thrilled when Bridgestone had major layoffs he started another company years ago but was waiting for the big bag to officially leave . Im not_saying that the marketing is going to go straight up from here . February is historically a poor month . What I am saying is what everyone knows and yet everyone seems to find every excuse not_to do Buy Low Sell High . This is an opportunity to buy not_sell ."

      "selftext": "SAAS stocks are getting a pretty consistent hammering recently, but have they entering oversold territory? Particularly this week there is a panic reaction to anthropics new product announcement. Undoubtedly the 'per seat' revenue model is going to take a hit but some are down 80% YoY despite consistent and sustained growth. It smells of being into oversold territory. Agents are useful to be used in the SMB space for some trades people but as soon as your business gets scale your going too need a solid trustworthy tech stack to store and draw your data from that humans can also use as people like to get stuck into the details, so.. Am I wrong to think it's more likely agentic capabilities on a CRM humans also use is more likely to succeed than a pure agentic system where your data vanishes into some black box.",

Undoubtedly the per seat revenue model is going to take a hit but some are down 80 % YoY despite consistent and sustained growth . It smells of being into oversold territory . Agents are useful to be used in the SMB space for some trades people but as soon as your business gets scale your going too need a solid trustworthy tech stack to store and draw your data from that humans can also use as people like to get stuck into the details so .. Am I wrong to think its more likely agentic capabilities on a CRM humans also use is more likely to succeed than a pure agentic system where your data vanishes into some black box ."

      "selftext": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade (for the stocks he got when he sold his company). Mid last year, a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm, QS, Sofi, etc were doing very well. They were at their respective ATH. Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax (including some STCG). And nobody knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH. So apart from potential higher taxes, the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market. But then, what if market reverses the direction from here ? The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns - gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside. Cost was just a little premium (collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC - and if you choose different months for the put and calls, the cost could be 0 or even positive). Eg. QS reached highs n late 2025. And now it is back to \\~8 (down 50% than the highs). But a collar position with expiry in 2026, I paid just a little premium - allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices. And gave me right to sell at \\~16 even if stock goes down - which turned out the case. Now even when it is at \\~8, I shall be able to sell at \\~$16. I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating. I wish, I had known this in 2021/22 when we had such peaks and then big drops. Sharing as it has helped me. See if it helps you in the future. This is not an advice. DYOR. Good luck!",

I like the idea of putting 1200 into an ETF and 300 into a few things I have researched and picked for special interest . I dont know if thats a really bad idea though and if now is a good or bad time to start . Maybe sitting on cash for a while is a better propositions .

      "selftext": "Look guys, this is pretty simple. SpaceX wants to go public at an eye-watering $1.5 _trillion_ valuation. What are the earnings for this out-of-this-world company? [$8 Billion]( That gives us a PE ratio of, checks notes, 187. (Edit: I've been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA, not earnings, so the PE ratio is probably north of 300. NOICE.) Now, this is 2026, PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed, but still, there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation, right? Ah, yes. Datacenters in space. Sure, Elon is the world's biggest bullshit factory, but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint. Self driving cars? Yeah! Robotaxis? Sure! Humanoid sexdolls? Why not! But what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for. We've got datacenters at home, goddamit. (Of course, it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich, a shitducken so to speak, but whose counting shit here). Here is my prediction. Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers, IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch. There will be a roadshow, and pension funds, endowments, etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it. And I don't think they will. So instead of the famously diamond-handed Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO, it will be desperate buyers of ~~hand grenades~~ hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like god's asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim. Now, that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_, but we're talking SpaceX here. _Elon_. Either the IPO doesn't happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle. And people will panic. The entire AI narrative that has been holding on our K-shaped economy will blow up like a little kid flying into space when his fat cousin jumps off the see-saw. Bye, timmy. Just you fucking wait. Buying calls.",

      "selftext_processed": "Look guys this is pretty simple . SpaceX wants to go public at an eyewatering $ 1.5 _trillion_ valuation . What are the earnings for this outofthisworld company $ 8 Billion That gives us a PE ratio of checks notes 187 . Edit Ive been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA not_earnings so the PE ratio is probably north of 300 . NOICE . Now this is 2026 PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed but still there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation right Ah yes . Datacenters in space . Sure Elon is the worlds biggest bullshit factory but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint . Self driving cars Yeah Robotaxis Sure Humanoid sexdolls Why not_But what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for . Weve got datacenters at home goddamit . Of course it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich a shitducken so to speak but whose counting shit here . Here is my prediction . Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch . There will be a roadshow and pension funds endowments etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it . And I dont think they will . So instead of the famously diamondhanded Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO it will be desperate buyers of hand grenades hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like gods asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim . Now that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_ but were talking SpaceX here . _Elon_ . Either the IPO doesnt happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle . And people will panic . The entire AI narrative that has been holding on our Kshaped economy will blow up like a little kid flying into space when his fat cousin jumps off the seesaw . Bye timmy . Just you fucking wait . Buying calls ."

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Burry isn’t wrong to warn about valuation risk in crypto-linked stocks, but his bankruptcy narrative misunderstands how ETFs, miners, and balance sheets actually work for **MARA** and **MSTR.** I hope he reads this headline because I mean it. I‘ve following Michael Burry for quite a while, and he’s generally likable, has a decent understanding of macroeconomics, but he broad-brushes scenarios across industries he doesn’t fully understand the mechanics of. My first flag of doubt came after he spoke on how the index investors were making a huge mistake by moving into passive ETFs. He claimed that ETF sponsors would not know how to navigate massive liquidity events, where either the ETF shares or the underlying assets would face major selling pressures and decouple. This, I believe, stemmed from a complete misunderstanding on how the ETFs are created and destroyed and the markets that make them in the first place. Since the rise in ETF‘s popularity, there have been quite a number of events that tested his hypothesis and proved him to be wrong. Overtly wrong. His more recent callout was directed towards the decline of Bitcoin and how it would be fatal to the big-name mining companies. I read what he’s put out there to make sure I wasn’t grossly overlooking anything, and after doing some scenario testing at a $35-45k price point, I can honestly say there is not remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he’s supposing we’ll see. I‘m not a bitcoin guy. I love the blockchain technology, but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin. Recently, I’ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies. I think crypto mining and staking isn’t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies. I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA, your company isn’t at risk of disappearing overnight. Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors: a lack of balance sheet flexibility, lack of liquidity to maintain operations, declining operating income, persistent DSCR <1, or high maintenance capital costs. pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy. Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy (who hasn’t?). …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor’s, he’s far from bankrupt. MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt. MARA, the other company he’s picked on, also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow. Though their bankruptcy risk is a non-zero probability, it’s still incredibly low. The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it’s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin. Done. That‘s all to be said. I‘d accept that warning all day. Everything else is just noise.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Burry isn ’ t wrong to warn about valuation risk in cryptolinked stocks but his bankruptcy narrative misunderstands how ETFs miners and balance sheets actually work for MARA and MSTR . I hope he reads this headline because I mean it . I ‘ ve following Michael Burry for quite a while and he ’ s generally likable has a decent understanding of macroeconomics but he broadbrushes scenarios across industries he doesn ’ t fully understand the mechanics of . My first flag of doubt came after he spoke on how the index investors were making a huge mistake by moving into passive ETFs . He claimed that ETF sponsors would not_know how to navigate massive liquidity events where either the ETF shares or the underlying assets would face major selling pressures and decouple . This I believe stemmed from a complete misunderstanding on how the ETFs are created and destroyed and the markets that make them in the first place . Since the rise in ETF ‘ s popularity there have been quite a number of events that tested his hypothesis and proved him to be wrong . Overtly wrong . His more recent callout was directed towards the decline of Bitcoin and how it would be fatal to the bigname mining companies . I read what he ’ s put out there to make sure I wasn ’ t grossly overlooking anything and after doing some scenario testing at a $ 3545k price point I can honestly say there is not_remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he ’ s supposing we ’ ll see . I ‘ m not_a bitcoin guy . I love the blockchain technology but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin . Recently I ’ ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies . I think crypto mining and staking isn ’ t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies . I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA your company isn ’ t at risk of disappearing overnight . Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors a lack of balance sheet flexibility lack of liquidity to maintain operations declining operating income persistent DSCR 1 or high maintenance capital costs . pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy . Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy who hasn ’ t . …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor ’ s he ’ s far from bankrupt . MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt . MARA the other company he ’ s picked on also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow . Though their bankruptcy risk is a nonzero probability it ’ s still incredibly low . The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it ’ s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin . Done . That ‘ s all to be said . I ‘ d accept that warning all day . Everything else is just noise ."

I can’t post in DD section yet as I don’t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn. This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we’re talking 25 + Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models. Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April. Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I’ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow.

When NVDA said early last year that ’ ll cost them 5.5 Billion in 1 quarter April 2025 for the ban likely 20 billion on year . Keep in account china accounted for 25 % of sales from NVDA Down to now 8 % this happened due to export regulations on WEAKER H20 CHIPS .. now significantly more valuable H200 chips just got green light from 🥭 waiting on NVDA approval huge turn of events . I can ’ t post in DD section yet as I don ’ t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn . This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we ’ re talking 25 Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models . Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April . Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I ’ ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow .

      "selftext": "When Figma IPO’d, there was a lot of hype. It’s a great product, tons of designers use it, and it felt like one of those stocks you had to own. Now the stock is down about 80% from its IPO, and I’m wondering how people who bought in are feeling. Do you regret buying, or do you still believe in the company long term and see this as just part of the ride? For those who didn’t buy, does it feel like you dodged a bullet, or are you starting to think this might be a good chance to get in at a much lower price? With tech stocks getting hit hard and expectations coming back to earth, this seems like a good example of hype vs. reality. Curious to hear how everyone’s looking at it now.",

      "selftext": "This is a theory I want to put across this board? And invite a discussion or scrutiny. My theory is that what we call \"tech\" now, may not be tech in the long run. At least not cutting edge tech. Yesterday's tech (software) has been taken over by Today's tech (AI/Quantum/Robotics) Today's tech will be replaced by tomorrow's tech and so on. But the companies can survive. At least some if not all. There might already be projects done within the company on technologies that will replace today's cutting edge technologies. Some within these Big Tech companies, others outside of Big Tech but Big Tech can easily buy those companies. Say biotechnology becomes the next big thing that gets a lot of attention. Or Agriculture. With deep pockets, these companies can easily gain a lead and keep their top positions. Sure not all will survive and not all those who will be the top companies in the future are already at the top. But if I were to invest in tech etfs, I don't think I need to be worried I think these tech etfs should continuously beat the broader market. 10 year CAGR for vgt is 22.6% where's s&p 500 is 14.7%. Am I missing something?",

At least not_cutting edge tech . Yesterdays tech software has been taken over by Todays tech AIQuantumRobotics Todays tech will be replaced by tomorrows tech and so on . But the companies can survive . At least some if not_all . There might already be projects done within the company on technologies that will replace todays cutting edge technologies . Some within these Big Tech companies others outside of Big Tech but Big Tech can easily buy those companies . Say biotechnology becomes the next big thing that gets a lot of attention . Or Agriculture . With deep pockets these companies can easily gain a lead and keep their top positions . Sure not_all will survive and not_all those who will be the top companies in the future are already at the top . But if I were to invest in tech etfs I dont think I need to be worried I think these tech etfs should continuously beat the broader market . 10 year CAGR for vgt is 22.6 % wheres sp 500 is 14.7 % . Am I missing something"

      "selftext": "I listened to the Microsoft and Google Q4 Earnings and although you can never be 100% confident going into an earnings report, I believe AMZN has a 95%+ chance of beating their earnings materially. Here's why I think that: * Azure doesn't have strong custom silicon (they are trying to catch-up with Maya) compared to GCP (TPUs) and AWS (Trainium) and I believe this will truly be more apparent this quarter. Even without potential margin expansion from restructurings and robotics in their fulfilment centers, I think this will be an extremely strong earnings report from Amazon. Whether the market reacts favorably or unfavorably due to increases in Capital spend (like it has with Microsoft & Google) will be a different story. I think based on the above and the potential for a Prime subscription price hike to mitigate tariff impacts (unless SCOTUS rules on it), AMZN is due for a stock run-up. The timing is not ideal with a broad tech sell-off the past week (and is why I'd stick to stock not short-dated options), but my Price Target is $250 - $260 after earnings and $300 EOY.

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about where the next truly big investment opportunities are going to come from, and honestly, I’m struggling to get excited about what's possible right now. Obviously we have the big tech giants, but I'm talking about some long term multi bagger that I can jeet into. When you look at what VCs are funding today, SaaS apps, iOS apps & AI wrappers, it feels like competitive advantage is thinner than ever. Building software is cheaper, faster, and more accessible than at any point in history, I can literally make a Notion/Monday.com equivalent from my bed in 1 day. As a result, a lot of “moats” seem to boil down to marketing, distribution, or short-term execution rather than anything structural. That naturally compresses multiples over time. Then you zoom out to the layer these apps are built on: the AI models themselves. Most applications are model-agnostic. If you’re using OpenAI today, you can switch to Gemini, Claude, or another model tomorrow with relatively low friction. APIs are increasingly interchangeable, and customers don’t care *which* model you’re using as long as it works. Again, hard to see durable competitive advantage here. So you go one layer deeper: infrastructure,data centers, compute, chips. But here too, the picture isn’t great. These businesses are insanely capital intensive, require massive scale to generate decent returns, and are likely to be cash-flow negative for a long time. At the current valuations, it’s not obvious that risk-adjusted returns are attractive unless you’re already a hyperscaler. That leaves me with a question on where to invest next... If apps have weak moats, models are interchangeable, and infrastructure is capital-heavy with questionable economics… **where is the real, durable value being created in tech right now?** ik this is a pessimistic take, but I also don’t get excited about putting capital into KO, PEP, and consumer staples tbh nothing new there. I’m curious where people see *investable* opportunities that actually have long-term defensibility.",

The year-over-year increase was driven by organic growth and the acquisition of Comtrafo, which closed on December 5, 2025, contributing partial results from the final weeks of the quarter. Our third quarter fiscal 2025 net income and non-GAAP net income include a $113.1 million tax benefit related to the release of a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. Given this discrete tax benefit, AMSC’s net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $117.8 million, or $2.68 per share, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2024. The Company’s non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $123.5 million, or $2.81 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net income of $6.0 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2024. Please refer to the financial table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on December 31, 2025, totaled $147.1 million, compared with $85.4 million at March 31, 2025. \"AMSC delivered an outstanding third quarter,\" said Daniel P. McGahn, Chairman, President, and CEO, AMSC. \"We grew revenue by more than 20% year-over-year, and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability and our tenth of non-GAAP profitability. Reflecting our shift to profitability, we also recorded a tax benefit event this quarter. Again, gross margin exceeded 30% and we ended the quarter with over $145 million in cash after completing the acquisition of Comtrafo. Strong market demand drove bookings resulting in a robust 12-month backlog of over $250 million. Revenue through the past nine months nearly matches our total revenue for the entire prior fiscal year, highlighting our company's financial and end-market momentum.\" Business Outlook For the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2026, AMSC expects that its revenues will exceed $80.0 million. The Company’s net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to exceed $3.0 million, or $0.07 per share. The Company's non-GAAP net income (as defined below) is expected to exceed $8.0 million, or $0.17 per share. EDIT: Buy or short the stock, or play derivatives. I'm not a financial advisor.

Oil prices are hovering around 5 year lows, could see price tailwinds due to geopolitical tensions 2. Validation from Buffet at 27% stake; says he might own this stock \"forever\". Buffet also recently purchased their chemical division OxyChem, reducing company debt. 3. Occidental has approximately 40% stake in a company called NET Power (NPWR), who is working on emerging natural gas technology called super critical CO2 (sCO2). OXY has upwards of $350m invested in this company/technology. 4. Profitable company with dividend 2.12% dividend. (Nothing to write home about but there are a lot of unprofitable companies out there!) 5. PE ratio of 34x is expensive for E&P companies 6. Super critical CO2 is exciting technology (90% reduction in reactor size, zero emissions, etc.) but first commercial demonstration will not be proven out until 2028 at the earliest. Also faces competition from GEV and others. 7. Buffet's average cost is about $51.76 per share, so he is underwater on this one. What's your opinion, do you think Warren is wrong on this one or is it a smart 3-5 year play?",

      "selftext": "Smart glasses are disrupting smartphones as the next generation human-to-computer interface. Meta leads in spending reportedly up to 100B in AR/VR efforts. Consumer, industrial and military adoption is happening fast. One phone maker has already abandoned hand-held devices for glasses. I'm more interested in growth exposure than getting a pair. This is Meta's best chance of entrenching its media platforms into next hardware transition. Apple is conjuring something and Google is jumping back into battle after defeat of its first Glass attempt. Samsung is Android armed but MSFT appears done with AR after handing its program over to Anduril. Competition is fierce. The Bigs are willing to ignore hardware profits to build or maintain walled gardens. Unlike with phones, China has access to US AR markets and doing very well. US companies will remain leaders as wearables become the ultimate AI infrastructure. Google seems favored with software advantage but Meta is clearly ahead in hardware. New, optical technology is driving most development and suppliers have potentially more growth opportunity than choosing between multi-trillion dollar market caps financing advanced tech for eyeballs. AR tech has many directions but I'm focused on what Meta, the market leader is saying. Would love to learn more about LED projection leaders but they are mostly in Taiwan. Silicon Carbide (SiC) has emerged as holy grail of AR lens material. Most SiC stocks are down, apparently from EV downturn but electrification is unstoppable. Meta is [obsessed with SiC]( for AR lenses, representing enormous new market for SiC material players. AR lenses use much more material than semiconductors. Meta says very [clearly that SiC]( is their goal for AR lenses. Director of Meta optics, Barry Silverstein is practically begging industry for more SiC in this [Photonics Spectra article]( I have a basket of SiC and GaN stocks focused mainly on SiC materials market leader. I also have been building high performance battery plays but they have optimistic valuations right now. Curious how others are investing in the AR glasses and related optics space. EDIT TO ADD: Thought readers were better informed about AR market growth and it's growing role as AI infrastructure. Meta is reportedly considering production capacity of 20 Million units per year by end of this year. 20M is 2X more than all '08 I phone sales. According to Gemini: >The Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses market is experiencing rapid, high-growth, with shipments projected to jump from roughly 850,000 in 2024 to 32 million by 2030, a CAGR of 82.9% in the consumer segment. Driven by AI integration, lightweight designs, and no-display models, the broader market is expected to grow 39.2% in 2025.",

      "selftext": "# DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat. The stock is down over 90% from all time highs in 2021, currently trading at roughly $6 per share with a $10B market cap. The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management, best personified by their hedonistic CEO (Evan Spiegel) who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years, creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune. This, coupled with strong competition from $META, has driven sentiment to perhaps an all-time low. But behind all of this I see, and the data tells me, that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential, currently generating its highest revenue in company history, something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenue-model and the launch of their heavily researched & developed AR Glasses. *Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1...* I have been plotting a $snap long for weeks now, and given the recent sell-off (1-month decline of -30%), I think being long going into earnings offers amazing risk/reward. I will try to concisely summarize my stance: # Snapchat+ Subscriptions: * **The Perfect Rugpull -** Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters. Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025, effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories. The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscription-based revenue and becomes less reliant on ads. Net Profitability will increase: non paying users = less AWS expenses, Paying users = high-margin revenue * **The Data -** Kevory tried compiling [data]( i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications * **My Subscription Forecast -** I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount, as well as users who pay for storage only: |**Quarter**|**Subscribers**|**Other Revenue**|**Analysis**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q1 2025**|**14 Million**|\\~$155M|Shift toward creator-focused features.| |**Q2 2025**|**15 Million**|\\~$170M|Steady organic growth. 9% of total revenue.| |**Q3 2025**|**17 Million**|**$190M**|**Pre-Storage Spike:** Accelerated 35% YoY growth. 12.6% of total revenue.| |**Q4 2025 (Est)**|**19.5M - 20M**|**$245M+**|**The Storage Catalyst:** First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact. Up to 15% of total revenue.| # Spectacles (AR Glasses): * **Launch of market-leading AR Glasses** \\- Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026. Has Spent over $3 Billion in R&D over the past decade. Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem (400k+ developers) and in certain aspects of hardware. * **Superior Balance Sheet -** Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $Snap look superior in the future (less R&D costs), while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META. # Management: There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down: * **SBC (share based compensation) -** historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses. I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential. Things can only get better from here. *Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1...* * **Meta competition -** because of Spiegel’s unwillingness to sell to Meta, Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta. Meta also has in-house datacenters and a more-optimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable. Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU - big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order. Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META. What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitude/approach, stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company, with 90-day mission-cycles and 100x returns. # The Upcoming Earnings: * **Christmas and AI Pump -** Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge. Meta recently beat massively much thanks to ai-driven ad optimization, something I forecast also has helped Snap. Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future. * **Mean reversion -** Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings. Currently -20% on the week. With sentiment being at all time lows, I expect a classic inverse move. |**Quarter**|**Report Date**|**1-Week Pre-Earnings**|**Next Day Reaction**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q3 2025**|Nov 5, 2025|**+4.8%**|**+9.7%**| |**Q2 2025**|Aug 5, 2025|**+6.8%**|**-17.2%**| |**Q1 2025**|Apr 29, 2025|**+12.2%**|**-12.4%**| |**Q4 2024**|Feb 4, 2025|**+2.1%**|**-8.4%**| |**Q3 2024**|Oct 29, 2024|**+5.3%**|**-14.1%**| |**Q2 2024**|Aug 1, 2024|**+3.9%**|**-18.3%**| |**Q1 2024**|Apr 25, 2024|**-4.1%**|**+27.6%**| |**Q4 2023**|Feb 6, 2024|**+8.4%**|**-34.6%**| * **Expectations:** Stock is at a 52-week low ($6.00) and priced for a \"double-miss\" disaster. According to my data we will see a massive double beat. Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures, but forecast it to be big. Recent analyst ratings: * Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $9 to $10 on Jan. 30, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $10 to $9 on Jan. 20, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $9.5 to $8.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%. * Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an Equal-Weight rating and raised the price target from $8.5 to $9.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69%. * Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $9 to $8.5 on Dec. 19, 2025. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71%. In summary, given the current price of snap, I forecast any risk of earnings-centred pullback to be miniscule. I think the market is pricing the stock for a double-miss, the data tells me we are gonna see a double beat. People have the misconception that the company is dying, but my view is contrarian. DAU and revenue is steadily increasing, with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers. # TLDR: * I entered a Long on $SNAP today ahead of earnings (which come after market close) * Market has priced the stock for a double miss. I think we will see a double beat.",

      "selftext_processed": "DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat . The stock is down over 90 % from all time highs in 2021 currently trading at roughly $ 6 per share with a $ 10B market cap . The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management best personified by their hedonistic CEO Evan Spiegel who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune . This coupled with strong competition from $ META has driven sentiment to perhaps an alltime low . But behind all of this I see and the data tells me that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential currently generating its highest revenue in company history something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenuemodel and the launch of their heavily researched developed AR Glasses . Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1 ... I have been plotting a $ snap long for weeks now and given the recent selloff 1month decline of 30 % I think being long going into earnings offers amazing riskreward . I will try to concisely summarize my stance Snapchat Subscriptions The Perfect Rugpull Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters . Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025 effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories . The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscriptionbased revenue and becomes less reliant on ads . Net Profitability will increase non paying users less AWS expenses Paying users highmargin revenue The Data Kevory tried compiling data i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications My Subscription Forecast I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount as well as users who pay for storage only QuarterSubscribersOther RevenueAnalysis Q1 202514 Million $ 155MShift toward creatorfocused features . Q2 202515 Million $ 170MSteady organic growth . 9 % of total revenue . Q3 202517 Million $ 190MPreStorage Spike Accelerated 35 % YoY growth . 12.6 % of total revenue . Q4 2025 Est19.5M 20M $ 245MThe Storage Catalyst First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact . Up to 15 % of total revenue . Spectacles AR Glasses Launch of marketleading AR Glasses Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026 . Has Spent over $ 3 Billion in RD over the past decade . Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem 400k developers and in certain aspects of hardware . Superior Balance Sheet Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $ Snap look superior in the future less RD costs while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META . Management There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down SBC share based compensation historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses . I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential . Things can only get better from here . Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1 ... Meta competition because of Spiegel ’ s unwillingness to sell to Meta Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta . Meta also has inhouse datacenters and a moreoptimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable . Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order . Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META . What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitudeapproach stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company with 90day missioncycles and 100x returns . The Upcoming Earnings Christmas and AI Pump Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge . Meta recently beat massively much thanks to aidriven ad optimization something I forecast also has helped Snap . Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future . Mean reversion Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings . Currently 20 % on the week . With sentiment being at all time lows I expect a classic inverse move . QuarterReport Date1Week PreEarningsNext Day Reaction Q3 2025Nov 5 20254.8 % 9.7 % Q2 2025Aug 5 20256.8 % 17.2 % Q1 2025Apr 29 202512.2 % 12.4 % Q4 2024Feb 4 20252.1 % 8.4 % Q3 2024Oct 29 20245.3 % 14.1 % Q2 2024Aug 1 20243.9 % 18.3 % Q1 2024Apr 25 20244.1 % 27.6 % Q4 2023Feb 6 20248.4 % 34.6 % Expectations Stock is at a 52week low $ 6.00 and priced for a doublemiss disaster . According to my data we will see a massive double beat . Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures but forecast it to be big . Recent analyst ratings Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $ 9 to $ 10 on Jan. 30 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 10 to $ 9 on Jan. 20 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $ 9.5 to $ 8.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77 % . Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an EqualWeight rating and raised the price target from $ 8.5 to $ 9.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69 % . Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 9 to $ 8.5 on Dec. 19 2025 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71 % . In summary given the current price of snap I forecast any risk of earningscentred pullback to be miniscule . I think the market is pricing the stock for a doublemiss the data tells me we are gon na see a double beat . People have the misconception that the company is dying but my view is contrarian . DAU and revenue is steadily increasing with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers . TLDR I entered a Long on $ SNAP today ahead of earnings which come after market close Market has priced the stock for a double miss . I think we will see a double beat ."

      "selftext": "For context I’m 19, have $15k in my ROTH, and the Army is paying for the rest of my school/board. I have no real future costs for the next 5y, as I just paid the $22k the army wouldn’t cover. I have $6k liquid cash, and have been thinking about putting $4k into Microsoft. It’s now reset to its 1-year point, which feels like an incredible opportunity. However, every other tech stock has seemingly tripled. I can’t figure out what that means to me. Does that mean Microsoft is crazy undervalued and will start to skyrocket its recovery in the future? Or does it mean it’s not a smart choice? I know nobody truly knows, but am looking for at least a more experience opinion than mine. There’s also the aspect that if there is a bubble that crashes, if Microsoft wasn’t effected by the up, it wouldn’t be effected by the downs, and I don’t lose my money. On the other hand, if there is no pop, that 4K could have doubled in a couple years in a different company while it remains instead stagnant in Microsoft. Microsoft is nearly down to where it was at times in 2024. Anyways yea just looking for thoughts. Anything is appreciated",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 40 years old and currently invested in Vanguard Target Date Fund 2065 in my 401(k). It’s been a solid “set it and forget it” option, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s too conservative for my actual timeline and goals. I’m planning to retire somewhere in my early to mid‑60s, so realistically I still have 20–25 years of compounding ahead of me. That’s a long runway, and I’m thinking about shifting to a more high‑growth / aggressive allocation while I still can. Here's the URL link of available funds: [**401k Fidelity Available Funds**]( I’m considering building my own allocation instead of sticking with the TDF, something like: \\- Heavy S&P 500 exposure \\- A tilt toward large‑cap growth \\- Maybe a small slice of mid/small caps \\- Minimal or no bonds for now Basically, a more aggressive equity mix that could outperform the TDF over the long haul, with the understanding that I’d rebalance periodically. So, I'm thinking of below. **PROPOSED INVESTMENT:** 60% FXAIX (S&P 500) 20% FSPGX (Large Cap Growth) 10% FSPSX (International Index) 10% FSMDX or RSPYX (Mid or Small Cap) **WHY**: I think it's diversified enough to avoid concentration risk as it keeps the S&P 500 as the core, adds growth, but not overwhelmingly, adds mid/small caps for factor diversification, and keeps a small international slice for global exposure. It's aggressive, but not fragile -- if that makes sense and my opinion. And easy to manage a 4-fund portfolio. Thoughts?",

It ’ s been a solid “ set it and forget it ” option but I ’ m starting to wonder if it ’ s too conservative for my actual timeline and goals . I ’ m planning to retire somewhere in my early to mid‑60s so realistically I still have 20–25 years of compounding ahead of me . That ’ s a long runway and I ’ m thinking about shifting to a more high‑growth aggressive allocation while I still can . Heres the URL link of available funds 401k Fidelity Available Funds I ’ m considering building my own allocation instead of sticking with the TDF something like Heavy SP 500 exposure A tilt toward large‑cap growth Maybe a small slice of midsmall caps Minimal or no_bonds for now Basically a more aggressive equity mix that could outperform the TDF over the long haul with the understanding that I ’ d rebalance periodically . So Im thinking of below . PROPOSED INVESTMENT 60 % FXAIX SP 500 20 % FSPGX Large Cap Growth 10 % FSPSX International Index 10 % FSMDX or RSPYX Mid or Small Cap WHY I think its diversified enough to avoid concentration risk as it keeps the SP 500 as the core adds growth but not_overwhelmingly adds midsmall caps for factor diversification and keeps a small international slice for global exposure . Its aggressive but not_fragile if that makes sense and my opinion . And easy to manage a 4fund portfolio . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "I've heard it all: \"Value Trap, Dying business, Competition\" Let's start from the $310 price it was in 2021. There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high. That puts PayPal close to a $300B valuation with $4B net income. It was trading for 80X earnings. Let's talk about the positives: \\#1. PayPal Bans - Have you heard those stories? People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage. What does this truly mean? This means most of it's revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention. \\#2. Mark Grether - **PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026. I'm getting emails.** The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform. However, PayPal made a huge mistake here not making this the main focus. Who is Mark? Well, in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon. Amazon then took it's ad unit from $10B to $30B in revenue. Uber hired Mark. In 2022 to 2024, Mark took Uber's ad business to $0 to $1B in revenue. What is PayPals Ad Manager? Let's act as if this was my own website. My post will get thousands of clicks but no monetization. Now, with PayPal ads, I can integrate their SDK into my website, and within minutes start running ads on this post. (Not this actual post but if it was my site) This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars. For example, if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $2B revenue at 50% margins, they would go from $5-6B net income, to $6-7B net income, and slowly go higher overtime. This is the setup the stock needs to go $100+ \\#3. PayPal Integrations - People seem to forget, PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal. This means users/businesses all get free advertising to PayPal. No matter what, naturally PayPal will grow for the next 5-10 years. Does it need more social growth? People choosing to actually want it? Yes. As an online business, if I'm not accepting PayPal I'm at a huge disadvantage. People use PayPal for their chargeback protection. I'm confident anytime I buy with PayPal I'm protected. Side Note: PayPal's and Venmo's cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet. **The moat remains in ads. PayPal's entire focus needs to shift to running ads.** **Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years, to sell now, ask yourself, why? PayPal ads release in early 2026. This is the product that will drive growth. We haven't even seen it yet.**",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive heard it all Value Trap Dying business Competition Lets start from the $ 310 price it was in 2021 . There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high . That puts PayPal close to a $ 300B valuation with $ 4B net income . It was trading for 80X earnings . Lets talk about the positives 1 . PayPal Bans Have you heard those stories People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage . What does this truly mean This means most of its revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention . 2 . Mark Grether PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026 . Im getting emails . The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform . However PayPal made a huge mistake here not_making this the main focus . Who is Mark Well in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon . Amazon then took its ad unit from $ 10B to $ 30B in revenue . Uber hired Mark . In 2022 to 2024 Mark took Ubers ad business to $ 0 to $ 1B in revenue . What is PayPals Ad Manager Lets act as if this was my own website . My post will get thousands of clicks but no_monetization . Now with PayPal ads I can integrate their SDK into my website and within minutes start running ads on this post . Not this actual post but if it was my site This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars . For example if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $ 2B revenue at 50 % margins they would go from $ 56B net income to $ 67B net income and slowly go higher overtime . This is the setup the stock needs to go $ 100 3 . PayPal Integrations People seem to forget PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal . This means usersbusinesses all get free advertising to PayPal . No_matter what naturally PayPal will grow for the next 510 years . Does it need more social growth People choosing to actually want it Yes . As an online business if Im not_accepting PayPal Im at a huge disadvantage . People use PayPal for their chargeback protection . Im confident anytime I buy with PayPal Im protected . Side Note PayPals and Venmos cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet . The moat remains in ads . PayPals entire focus needs to shift to running ads . Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years to sell now ask yourself why PayPal ads release in early 2026 . This is the product that will drive growth . We havent even seen it yet ."

      "selftext": "Carvana stock has plummeted from its recent $490 high to just $369 as of midday February 5 2026 Many people have never heard Bridgecrest before, and don’t understand why they are the worst human beings on the planet, and how they are associated with Carvana. In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital, Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22% If you have never heard of Bridgecrest before, that is why. Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period. My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse. As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader, I’ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time. The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150,000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax. And he owed $15,800 to Bridgecrest on a $4,000 car. After a short conversation with him, I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap. All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount. After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest, a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff, but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote. This is highly unusual for a bank, as most banks would want to receive the $15,800. They were owed in a timely manner and not have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number. How does this tie in the Carvana stock? Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana, owned through shady, backdoor dealings. And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying. Full disclosure. I am not a financial professional. This is not financial advice. Position disclosure: I have Current open short positions against Carvana. I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock, though it may open and close additional positions at any time.",

In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22 % If you have never_heard of Bridgecrest before that is why . Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period . My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse . As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader I ’ ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time . The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax . And he owed $ 15800 to Bridgecrest on a $ 4000 car . After a short conversation with him I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap . All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount . After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote . This is highly unusual for a bank as most banks would want to receive the $ 15800 . They were owed in a timely manner and not_have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number . How does this tie in the Carvana stock Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana owned through shady backdoor dealings . And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying . Full disclosure . I am not_a financial professional . This is not_financial advice . Position disclosure I have Current open short positions against Carvana . I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock though it may open and close additional positions at any time ."

I posted about it here: Back then, people called my investment terrible. Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no government support. But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis. Instead of liquidating everything, I added even more shares. I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce. That day has finally come. I’ve now turned that $40k loss into about +$200k gains including options. I did take profits on my June and $60 Jan calls this morning, but I’m still holding my $35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares. I believe solar is the future, and $ENPH is the leader in this space. I won’t lie, this trade drained me mentally. But days like today make it worth it. I earned this one. Cheers to ENPH shareholders, we deserve this victory today.",

I posted about it here Back then people called my investment terrible . Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no_government support . But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis . Instead of liquidating everything I added even more shares . I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce . That day has finally come . I ’ ve now turned that $ 40k loss into about $ 200k gains including options . I did take profits on my June and $ 60 Jan calls this morning but I ’ m still holding my $ 35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares . I believe solar is the future and $ ENPH is the leader in this space . I won ’ t lie this trade drained me mentally . But days like today make it worth it . I earned this one . Cheers to ENPH shareholders we deserve this victory today ."

It looks like there was a crude oil drawdown in the US based on the latest EIA weekly petroleum status report, but it doesn't seem to justify such a price bump. \\[EDIT\\] The spike is likely due to collapsing talks between the US and Iran that were scheduled to occur on Friday.

Almost every single one of these stocks, except for GOOG and MU, are significantly down from their 2026 start. We can take away a couple things. 1) reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks; clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence. 2) Redditors fail to follow a buying plan, if they had one to begin with, when their favorite stock dips 20-30%. Institutions on the other hand, force selling action on retailers, then buy at their planned price! That’s why they win out. I for one, am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip. I hope yall join me! Feel free to ask me what I’m buying and I’m staying clear of. 1: RKLB • 2 ASTS • ⁠3 AMZN • ⁠4 NBIS • ⁠5 GOOGL • ⁠6 RDDT • ⁠7 MU • ⁠8 SOFI • ⁠9 POET • ⁠10 AMD • ⁠11 IREN • ⁠12 HOOD • ⁠13 RIVN • ⁠14 NVDA • ⁠15 ONDS",

Almost every single one of these stocks except for GOOG and MU are significantly down from their 2026 start . We can take away a couple things . 1 reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence . 2 Redditors fail to follow a buying plan if they had one to begin with when their favorite stock dips 2030 % . Institutions on the other hand force selling action on retailers then buy at their planned price That ’ s why they win out . I for one am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip . I hope yall join me Feel free to ask me what I ’ m buying and I ’ m staying clear of . 1 RKLB • 2 ASTS • ⁠3 AMZN • ⁠4 NBIS • ⁠5 GOOGL • ⁠6 RDDT • ⁠7 MU • ⁠8 SOFI • ⁠9 POET • ⁠10 AMD • ⁠11 IREN • ⁠12 HOOD • ⁠13 RIVN • ⁠14 NVDA • ⁠15 ONDS"

      "selftext": "Vindicated? I think so, and if I'm right it means you shouldn't go long in RDDT. In the early 2020s I thought to myself that if RDDT ever got listed I would short it but didn't notice it listed until a year later. I noticed because of headlines about it plummeting under 200. I wrote that I was shocked to see it ever made it that high and that it would go below 100. I profited with an 80$ put to back that up (my first ever experiment with buying contracts.) As we all see RDDT, then surged back over 200 twice. And the fanboys (at least here in reddit) came out in droves. One even saying he steadily profits buying under 200 and selling over 200. Hope he didn't load up again after the third time. At first I asserted the initial decline was because reddit is a shitshow. The [pushback I got there]( was that advertisers on it are making money and that RDDT was only going to grow - hugely (as well as smug and smarmy replies.. as if they wished to confirm the shitshow aspect.) I hadn't researched the advertiser revenue yet, so I did. I can't go through all their balance sheets, but I read enough to learn how that works and it led me to surmise Advertisers can only make an educated guess, throw money at it, and then see how much (if any) new revenue can be tracked to that advertising expense. So I posted that's how the downfall would start; that eventually Advertisers would determine they don't make much from this platform, certainly not enough to keep pouring in good money after bad. Am I right? Certainly not as wrong as the wisecrackers wanted to think. Time always tells the truth. For RDDT I say that will be sooner than later, given Digg and Youtube impacts,such as this article mentions and [the cited analyst in it seems to be seeing what I was predicting](",

      "selftext_processed": "Vindicated I think so and if Im right it means you shouldnt go long in RDDT . In the early 2020s I thought to myself that if RDDT ever got listed I would short it but didnt notice it listed until a year later . I noticed because of headlines about it plummeting under 200 . I wrote that I was shocked to see it ever made it that high and that it would go below 100 . I profited with an 80 $ put to back that up my first ever experiment with buying contracts . As we all see RDDT then surged back over 200 twice . And the fanboys at least here in reddit came out in droves . One even saying he steadily profits buying under 200 and selling over 200 . Hope he didnt load up again after the third time . At first I asserted the initial decline was because reddit is a shitshow . The pushback I got there was that advertisers on it are making money and that RDDT was only going to grow hugely as well as smug and smarmy replies .. as if they wished to confirm the shitshow aspect . I hadnt researched the advertiser revenue yet so I did . I cant go through all their balance sheets but I read enough to learn how that works and it led me to surmise Advertisers can only make an educated guess throw money at it and then see how much if any new revenue can be tracked to that advertising expense . So I posted thats how the downfall would start that eventually Advertisers would determine they dont make much from this platform certainly not_enough to keep pouring in good money after bad . Am I right Certainly not_as wrong as the wisecrackers wanted to think . Time always tells the truth . For RDDT I say that will be sooner than later given Digg and Youtube impactssuch as this article mentions and the cited analyst in it seems to be seeing what I was predicting"

      "selftext": "Picked up ENPH Jan 2027 $100 calls back in October when solar was completely hated. Stock had been crushed for months, everyone was calling it dead money, margins were collapsing, demand falling off a cliff, etc. Basically peak pessimism. I’m up about 143% overall now and today alone was a big rip, but I’m still holding. Reason is pretty simple: most of the bad news is already priced in. ENPH went from a market darling to a total punching bag. At \\~$50, you’re looking at a stock that’s been repriced for a worst-case scenario that doesn’t need to reverse much for upside to show up. Solar is extremely rate-sensitive and we’re getting closer to the part of the cycle where rates actually start helping instead of hurting. Even a modest pickup in residential demand changes the narrative fast. ENPH also isn’t some garbage balance sheet company — they’ve got cash, solid tech, and they’ll still be standing when weaker players wash out. Another thing people aren’t really talking about enough is short interest. This name is crowded on the short side. Solar in general is one of the most hated trades out there. If earnings or guidance come in even slightly better than feared, shorts are going to have to cover, and this thing can move way faster than people expect. These are 2027 LEAPS so I’m not trying to time a perfect bottom. If ENPH just mean-reverts part of the way back over the next year or two, the payoff is there. I don’t need it to go back to ATHs for this to work. Not advice, just sharing the trade. Curious if anyone else is still watching solar or thinks this move is just a dead-cat bounce.",

      "selftext": "Figma has 1.5B cash trading at a 10B market cap. They are doing over 1B in revenue. And have around 40% YOY revenue growth 105% customer retention (which means they keep all their customers and add every quarter) CEO has an incentive plan like Elon where he only makes big $$ if the Figma stock price hits certain hurdles. (Like $60,$80, etc) Google bought shares of Figma around $65 a few months ago. Figma also has a AI product called Figma Make. U can try it for free just type Figma Make on google and you are able to just type and create a full website/app. It’s insane and the most impressive AI I’ve probably ever used. The collaborative design market is expected to grow massively over the next 10 years. Around 30% a year on average. Figma has ridiculously high margins that we’ve seen come down from 90s to 80s because they spend so much on AI R&D. But, I’m okay with this. I want them to continue being absolutely cutting edge Collaborative design is the best way to optimize workflow. The ceo can follow the UI/UX designer while the engineer follows and work together in live time which speed up workflow. I think around 90% of the s&p 500 uses Figma. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber etc all use Figma. Figma is the buy of the century. Holding 29,144 shares at $21.10 This is not financial advise. Just my opinion",

      "selftext": "Y’all saw the market yesterday, right? Tech got slapped. Software is getting smoked with this new \"AI Displacement\" narrative. Everyone’s running around screaming AI is gonna replace SaaS, dumping everything from Gaming to Cybersecurity. Calls for AMD earnings and NVDA H200 sales stalled to China aren’t helping either. BUT THEN. Late news drops: NVIDIA is nearing a $20 BILLION investment in OpenAI. Not the mythical $100B, but $20B from NVDA is still a fucking massive signal of commitment. They’re still backed into 2030. So, is this software beatdown just weak hands giving up before the real run? Are we seeing a pivot from overbought Semis into deeply discounted Software? If you’re making a call, you better have real money on the line. Positions or ban. What are you betting on for the AI rotation? Don’t cry about losses, show us the conviction!",

      "title": "Why It Feels Like Everyone Is Making Money in Markets (Survivorship Bias)",
      "selftext": "When you look at investing and trading communities, profit posts stand out the most. It can easily feel like everyone is making money. But what we are seeing is already a heavily filtered picture. This is a classic case of survivorship bias. Even if only a small percentage of people actually succeed, that small group is the one that speaks. They post their results, share screenshots, and tell their stories. Those stories get repeated and spread until they start to look like the normal outcome. Meanwhile, most of the people who lost money say nothing. They quietly disappear from the same communities. So the information we see becomes biased toward a small group of survivors. In psychology and behavioral economics, this distortion is called survivorship bias. It is dangerous in markets because it makes people focus on stories instead of outcomes over time. In investing, what matters more than “how much you made” is “how long you stayed in the game.” Once survivorship bias takes hold, people start thinking like this: “That person made several times their money, so maybe I can too.” What we rarely see is how many people tried the same approach, how many failed, or how much of the result was luck rather than skill. As a result, high-risk strategies often look far more attractive than they really are. So what should we look at instead? Not “who made the most money,” but how many people were able to survive using the same method over time. Any strategy can produce a few success stories. The real question is whether it keeps working as time goes on. A slowly growing account contains far more information than one that rose quickly. And the more desperate someone feels, the easier it is to fall into this bias. The more urgently you want results, the more your attention is drawn to extreme success stories. At moments like this, you should be more careful and more cautious, not more aggressive. When you invest in a rush, emotion takes the lead, and the result often ends in ruin. So when you feel pressured to hurry, the important question is not how much you can make, but how long you can last. Before thinking, “Maybe I can be the next success story,” it may be more realistic to ask: “How many people actually stayed in the game using this approach?”",

      "title": "Why I'm Betting (Relatively) Big on IPOs This Year - DD?",
      "selftext": "We've all heard of the massive IPOs due (hopefully) sometime this year, and with all the recent/accumulated hype around AI/SpaceTech companies, I think we should follow where the smart money goes. First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund, **Founders Fund:** They have major holdings/stakes in both **OpenAI** and notably **SpaceX,** with a massive **$1B** investment in late 2025 into **OpenAI** and total investments upwards of **$600-$700M** in **SpaceX,** which alone is worth over **$80 billion** as of today, and considering the fund has an **AUM** of **$17 billion** and **total realized/unrealized portfolio** of **\\~$200 billion,** a conservative estimate IPO of **$1.5T** will likely more than double their unrealized stake in **SpaceX** and combined with **OpenAI's** IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund. Now I'll mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated won't be a part of: **Anthropic. Co:** Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI, I think you all know **Anthropic** has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO, you cannot miss out on this one. Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion, **Low-risk/High-return Tickers** that directly stand to gain from the IPOs: 1. $SATS - SpaceX With around **45-50%** of their mkt cap in **SpaceX** shares, roughly **$10\\~$11B,** this ticker stands to gain the most from the **SpaceX** IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV, all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into **$DTECH** or **$RKLB.** 2. $MSFT - OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock, but it's all about to change for the better (for calls) in 2026. I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of \\~$540 and all I can see is **unlimited upside at a 23% discount.** With an **absurd 27% ownership stake in OpenAI,** even if Altman shit himself on live tv you'll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up. 3. $SKM - Anthropic If you want exposure to **Anthropic. Co,** look no further than **$SKM**, a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry, merely a subdivision of their parent company SK, one of the country's largest chaebols. With a dominance of **50.5 of all shares** in their local market, **$SKM** is a solid investment even without their major stakes in **Anthropic. Co.** A monopoly in their industry at a relative all-time low is a great investment nonetheless, but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings. **They hold an ownership stake of approximately** **0.58%\\~0.7%,** which may not seem like a lot, but relative to their **\\~$9B mkt cap**, it makes up a significant portion of **$SKM's valuation at around 20%-25% of the company.** They've also got a joint partnership with **Anthropic,** together developing a **Multilingual LLM** tailored for the telecommunications industry. The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on, and the general public knows little to nothing about **Anthropic or their projects with SKM**, so we are early investors here. And, if you look at their Ytd/1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming. my current positions are: $SATS: +1 contracts of $9.80 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $160 $MSFT: +2 contracts of $4.90 ac Expiry - 11/20 pt $600 $SKM: +5 contracts of $1.89 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $41 **Tldr; If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no downside risk load up on $sats, $msft, $skm;** **Calls, don't be a pussy**",

      "selftext_processed": "Weve all heard of the massive IPOs due hopefully sometime this year and with all the recentaccumulated hype around AISpaceTech companies I think we should follow where the smart money goes . First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund Founders Fund They have major holdingsstakes in both OpenAI and notably SpaceX with a massive $ 1B investment in late 2025 into OpenAI and total investments upwards of $ 600 $ 700M in SpaceX which alone is worth over $ 80 billion as of today and considering the fund has an AUM of $ 17 billion and total realizedunrealized portfolio of $ 200 billion a conservative estimate IPO of $ 1.5T will likely more than double their unrealized stake in SpaceX and combined with OpenAIs IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund . Now Ill mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated wont be a part of Anthropic . Co Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI I think you all know Anthropic has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO you can not miss out on this one . Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion LowriskHighreturn Tickers that directly stand to gain from the IPOs 1 . $ SATS SpaceX With around 4550 % of their mkt cap in SpaceX shares roughly $ 10 $ 11B this ticker stands to gain the most from the SpaceX IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into $ DTECH or $ RKLB . 2 . $ MSFT OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock but its all about to change for the better for calls in 2026 . I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of $ 540 and all I can see is unlimited upside at a 23 % discount . With an absurd 27 % ownership stake in OpenAI even if Altman shit himself on live tv youll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up . 3 . $ SKM Anthropic If you want exposure to Anthropic . Co look no_further than $ SKM a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry merely a subdivision of their parent company SK one of the countrys largest chaebols . With a dominance of 50.5 of all shares in their local market $ SKM is a solid investment even without their major stakes in Anthropic . Co. A monopoly in their industry at a relative alltime low is a great investment nonetheless but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings . They hold an ownership stake of approximately 0.58 % 0.7 % which may not_seem like a lot but relative to their $ 9B mkt cap it makes up a significant portion of $ SKMs valuation at around 20 % 25 % of the company . Theyve also got a joint partnership with Anthropic together developing a Multilingual LLM tailored for the telecommunications industry . The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on and the general public knows little to nothing_about Anthropic or their projects with SKM so we are early investors here . And if you look at their Ytd1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming . my current positions are $ SATS 1 contracts of $ 9.80 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 160 $ MSFT 2 contracts of $ 4.90 ac Expiry 1120 pt $ 600 $ SKM 5 contracts of $ 1.89 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 41 Tldr If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no_downside risk load up on $ sats $ msft $ skm Calls dont be a pussy"

      "selftext": "Currently, VOO makes up the largest position in my portfolio. However, I'm a non-American investing from outside, and I'm losing confidence in the US for obvious reasons. From an ethical standpoint, I also don't feel like continuing to invest in American companies when America is actively threatening and bullying other countries, including my own. Why should I contribute to an economy that is causing so much harm not only to itself but also the rest of the world? As I'm not a US citizen and have zero ties to the US, I'm thinking now might be a good time to sell all my VOO shares and convert them to VXUS instead, since I see international markets outperforming the US for at least the next few years. I don't have to pay capital gains where I live, so tax is a non-issue for me. Would it be OK to just go all-in on VXUS, or is this a bad idea?",

I admit I always only put small sums into small stocks that no one has heard of, hoping for a large return in a small amount of time, and the one thing I have never ever done, is put a large sum into large cap big companies, bcoz there is this fear in me that, I'm that unlucky guy who as soon as I decide to change my ways and put a large sum into a \"safe\" large cap company, is the day when the market turns and the large cap would drop 10% in a day and 30% in a month and I would lose more money buying a large cap than I ever did buying small caps. I don't know how to overcome this fear and I just wonder if people have lost large sums buying large cap, \"safe\", popular stocks?",

I admit I always only put small sums into small stocks that no_one has heard of hoping for a large return in a small amount of time and the one thing I have never_ever done is put a large sum into large cap big companies bcoz there is this fear in me that Im that unlucky guy who as soon as I decide to change my ways and put a large sum into a safe large cap company is the day when the market turns and the large cap would drop 10 % in a day and 30 % in a month and I would lose more money buying a large cap than I ever did buying small caps . I dont know how to overcome this fear and I just wonder if people have lost large sums buying large cap safe popular stocks"

      "selftext": "For the last decade, the mantra has been \"Software is eating the world.\" But as we enter 2026, the power dynamic has fundamentally shifted. While the world's focus remains on the \"ghost in the machine\" - the in AI, the algorithms, and the code - the real leverage has migrated back to the Physical Bits: the critical atoms that make the digital revolution possible. My investment thesis is built on three pillars of Scarcity, Energy, and Sovereignty: **1. The Energy Chokepoint (Uranium)** AI is the most energy-intensive technology in human history. We have reached a point where \"code\" is limited by \"current.\" You cannot run a global intelligence network on intermittent power; it requires the massive, carbon-free energy density that only Uranium can provide. By holding CCJ and UUUU, I am investing in the \"fuel\" for the AI era. In this hierarchy, the uranium atom is the ultimate \"bit\" of data center uptime. **2. The Kinetic Chokepoint (Rare Earths)** Software can think, but it cannot move without Rare Earth Elements (REEs). From the high-performance magnets in EV motors to the actuators in humanoid robotics, NdPr (Neodymium-Praseodymium) is the non-substitutable hardware that translates digital commands into physical motion. Through MP and LYSDY, I am positioned at the bottleneck of the \"Physical AI\" revolution. **3. The Geopolitical Moat** We are moving from a world of \"just-in-time\" globalism to a world of \"friend-shoring\" and resource nationalism. The value of these minerals is no longer just their market price; it is their provenance. By focusing on Western-aligned supply chains, I am betting on a \"Sovereignty Premium\" - the reality that a pound of uranium or a magnet produced in a secure, allied jurisdiction is worth significantly more than one controlled by a geopolitical rival. **The Bottom Line** In a world of infinite, replicable software, value naturally flows toward the finite and the non-substitutable. I will not invest in the companies that write the code, instead I’m choosing to invest in the companies that control the physical gatekeepers of the modern world. Tldr: I am long on the atoms that power the bits.",

Eli ‌Lilly was down about 4 % Structure Therapeutics fell 6.2 % while Altimmune dropped 4.2 % . Viking Therapeutics declined more than 3 % and Amgen slipped nearly 1 % ⁠in afternoon trading . The ‌Danish drugmaker said it expects sales to drop between 5 % and 13 % ‍this year compared with analysts average expectation of a 2 % decline . Its U.S.listed shares fell 13.8 % to $ 50.83 . Wegovymaker ​Novo also reported a 14 % fall in ‌fourthquarter operating profit to 31.7 billion Danish crowns slightly above the estimate of 31.2 billion crowns . The selloff comes as Wall Street is reassessing longheld expectations that the obesity drug market could ⁠hit $ 150 billion early next decade ​as U.S. prices for GLP1 ​treatments from Novo and Lilly fall sharply and competition intensifies in the cashpay ‍consumer market . Analysts ⁠have pushed out peak sales timelines and trimmed forecasts with some now seeing the ⁠market closer to $ 80 billion to $ 105 billion by 2030 ."

      "selftext": "Energy production and green technology will be critical over the coming decades as technological growth accelerates. Ensuring reliable power delivery will require significant investment, and new breakthroughs are likely to emerge along the way. I have invested to some extent in a nuclear-focused ETF, as nuclear energy has strong potential for delivering efficient, large-scale power generation. That said, nuclear projects are complex, expensive, and slow to build, so widespread expansion is likely to take decades. Recently, I watched a compelling video on the use of supercritical CO₂ in energy systems, which appears to be a promising emerging technology. My goal is to gain exposure early, before it becomes widely discussed, while diversifying within the energy production sector. Energy demand is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades, and meeting that demand is already a major challenge. I am interested in ways to invest in this technology and other emerging energy solutions while avoiding the higher risk associated with individual stocks. I understand that the U.S. was previously seen as a leader in this area, but China brought a commercially successful supercritical CO₂ power plant online in late 2025, marking a significant milestone. I would welcome any thoughts or suggestions on investment approaches in this space. [Link to youtube video ](",

      "title": "Netflix (NFLX) Deep Dive: The Empire won the streaming war. (But I refuse to buy)",
      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer thesis. I hold no position.** I’ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix’s latest guidance. If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022, you can officially burn that thesis. The Empire has struck back. They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade, effectively transitioning from a cash-burning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape. But here is the conflict: **I love the business. I respect the execution. But I hate the stock at these levels.** As a researcher, my job isn't to applaud the product, it's to price the risk. And right now, the market is pricing a \"Media Conglomerate\" like it’s still a \"SaaS Monopoly.\" Here is the why Netflix won but why I’m still sitting on my hands. **Part 1: Why I Like the Company (The \"Empire\" Thesis)** The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at \"Sub Count\" while Netflix was fixing the \"Plumbing.\" The Ad-Tier Was a Trojan Horse: The market treated the ad-tier as a desperate \"down-sell\" to stop churn. The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) expansion tool. Ad revenue surged 150% in 2025 and is projected to double again to $3B in 2026. They aren't just \"saving\" users; they are monetizing the \"freeloaders\" at a higher margin. Operational Excellence (The Margin Story): While legacy media (Disney, Paramount) is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes, Netflix has achieved \"Escape Velocity.\" They expanded operating margins to 27% in 2024 and are guiding for 29% in 2025. This is no longer a \"growth at all costs\" shop; it is a cash flow machine. The \"Default\" Utility: Netflix has effectively won the \"churn war.\" With over 300 million subscribers, it has become the global default for video consumption. In a recession, people cancel \"nice-to-haves\" (Starz, Discovery+); they keep the \"Utility\" (Netflix). **Part 2: The Trap (Why I’m NOT Buying)** This is where the \"Momentum\" crowd is about to get hurt. The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection (30x+ PE), but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody is discounting. **1. The WBD Elephant (The Valuation Breaker)** The rumored $83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros. Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis. The Re-Rating Risk: \"Tech Monopolies\" trade at 30x-40x PE. \"Media Conglomerates\" (like Comcast/Disney) trade at 15x-20x PE. If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP (Harry Potter, DC), they aren't just buying content; they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets. You cannot pay a premium \"Tech Multiple\" for a company that is becoming \"Cable Provider 2.0.\" The moment that deal ink dries, the multiple compression could be violent. **2. The \"One-Off\" Growth Illusion** A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown (Paid Sharing). This was a \"Step-Function\" increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once. The market is extrapolating that one-time revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend. Reality Check: We are hitting \"Subscription Saturation.\" The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin. The Verdict: Great Business, Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet. Right now, at near 52week lows, you are paying for: Flawless execution of the Ad-Tier. Zero friction in the WBD integration (if it happens). A \"Tech Premium\" on a \"Media\" business. That is Priced for Perfection. I am keeping my powder dry. I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a \"Media Utility,\" and the multiple compresses back to reality (\\~20x-25x earnings). **Further Discussion Points:** The Deal: If NFLX buys WBD, do you instantly re-rate them as a \"Legacy Media\" stock, or does the \"Tech Halo\" protect the multiple? Ad-Tier: Are you seeing the ad-tier actually cannibalize the premium plans, or is it truly additive? Valuation: Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at \\~12-15%, or is this just pure momentum?",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer thesis . I hold no_position . I ’ ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix ’ s latest guidance . If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022 you can officially burn that thesis . The Empire has struck back . They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade effectively transitioning from a cashburning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape . But here is the conflict I love the business . I respect the execution . But I hate the stock at these levels . As a researcher my job isnt to applaud the product its to price the risk . And right now the market is pricing a Media Conglomerate like it ’ s still a SaaS Monopoly . Here is the why Netflix won but why I ’ m still sitting on my hands . Part 1 Why I Like the Company The Empire Thesis The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at Sub Count while Netflix was fixing the Plumbing . The AdTier Was a Trojan Horse The market treated the adtier as a desperate downsell to stop churn . The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU Average Revenue Per User expansion tool . Ad revenue surged 150 % in 2025 and is projected to double again to $ 3B in 2026 . They arent just saving users they are monetizing the freeloaders at a higher margin . Operational Excellence The Margin Story While legacy media Disney Paramount is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes Netflix has achieved Escape Velocity . They expanded operating margins to 27 % in 2024 and are guiding for 29 % in 2025 . This is no_longer a growth at all costs shop it is a cash flow machine . The Default Utility Netflix has effectively won the churn war . With over 300 million subscribers it has become the global default for video consumption . In a recession people cancel nicetohaves Starz Discovery they keep the Utility Netflix . Part 2 The Trap Why I ’ m NOT_Buying This is where the Momentum crowd is about to get hurt . The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection 30x PE but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody_is discounting . 1 . The WBD Elephant The Valuation Breaker The rumored $ 83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros . Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis . The ReRating Risk Tech Monopolies trade at 30x40x PE . Media Conglomerates like ComcastDisney trade at 15x20x PE . If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP Harry Potter DC they arent just buying content they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets . You can not pay a premium Tech Multiple for a company that is becoming Cable Provider 2.0 . The moment that deal ink dries the multiple compression could be violent . 2 . The OneOff Growth Illusion A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown Paid Sharing . This was a StepFunction increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once . The market is extrapolating that onetime revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend . Reality Check We are hitting Subscription Saturation . The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin . The Verdict Great Business Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet . Right now at near 52week lows you are paying for Flawless execution of the AdTier . Zero friction in the WBD integration if it happens . A Tech Premium on a Media business . That is Priced for Perfection . I am keeping my powder dry . I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a Media Utility and the multiple compresses back to reality 20x25x earnings . Further Discussion Points The Deal If NFLX buys WBD do you instantly rerate them as a Legacy Media stock or does the Tech Halo protect the multiple AdTier Are you seeing the adtier actually cannibalize the premium plans or is it truly additive Valuation Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at 1215 % or is this just pure momentum"

      "title": "How much total wealth is now bubble wealth? Are we at a high?",
      "selftext": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth. I'd define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on non-producing assets without an underlying, historical, or productive market value. Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone, can collapse when the faith vanishes, with nobody willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse. In fact, there's no concept of a 'bargain' for a bubble commodity. Once the faith is gone, the value is gone. Real wealth examples: * real estate that people live in, using money from jobs. Or functioning commercial real estate. * stocks with a historically non-insane PE (say, less than 25 or 30). Yes, there's an exception for genuine likelihood of growth. * gold at historical prices (gold is faith based, but it's 10,000 years of faith). * dollars, exchangeable for above, as long as inflation is sane. * Dutch tulips c. 1635; Beanie Babies c. 1995. Bubble wealth examples: * the part of gold price above its historical norm, say $2500 (ie, a bit over plateau before 2024). Gold's current bubble value would be $16T using total amount of gold in existence; but only 22% is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits, so maybe just $3T. * most of silver's current price, but most of silver is in non-investment form. Silver has a $5T total cap, but only 5% is held as coin or bullion, so ignore silver. * cryptocurrency. Current bubble value $2.6T, assuming all crypto is hokum. * the $3T of AI infrastructure build-up could be bubble wealth, in full or in part. * real estate used to park money, that could not be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition. Bubble value: very hard to guess; the total [value of real estate shot up from $30T to $50T after covid,( when CPI says it should have gone to 38T, so there's $12T of bubble value maybe, unless the increase of prices is fundamental. * stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA - I'd say TSLA is 90% bubble but hard to say for NVDA. 50%? Anyway, maybe $4T just for these, then a bunch of other stocks, at various bubble fractions. * one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 20-25 (?) and today's value of 30 is bubble wealth, so at least 20% of the US market ($14T) is bubble wealth, but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated, and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up, with bargain hunters waiting to pile on. So let's not count the high current P/E, or discount its bubbliness by a lot. The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly, however. So there seems to be at least $20T of faith-based wealth out there, perhaps 65% of US GDP. The stock market lost $8T (equivalent to $12T today) in 2008; it lost $5T ($10T today) in 2000. Housing lost something like $6T in 2008, suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of today's bubble wealth. Comments? Are we in a record era bubble wealth? Or is this the wrong way to look at things?",

      "selftext_processed": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth . Id define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on nonproducing assets without an underlying historical or productive market value . Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone can collapse when the faith vanishes with nobody_willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse . In fact theres no_concept of a bargain for a bubble commodity . Once the faith is gone the value is gone . Real wealth examples real estate that people live in using money from jobs . Or functioning commercial real estate . stocks with a historically noninsane PE say less than 25 or 30 . Yes theres an exception for genuine likelihood of growth . gold at historical prices gold is faith based but its 10000 years of faith . dollars exchangeable for above as long as inflation is sane . Dutch tulips c. 1635 Beanie Babies c. 1995 . Bubble wealth examples the part of gold price above its historical norm say $ 2500 ie a bit over plateau before 2024 . Golds current bubble value would be $ 16T using total amount of gold in existence but only 22 % is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits so maybe just $ 3T . most of silvers current price but most of silver is in noninvestment form . Silver has a $ 5T total cap but only 5 % is held as coin or bullion so ignore silver . cryptocurrency . Current bubble value $ 2.6T assuming all crypto is hokum . the $ 3T of AI infrastructure buildup could be bubble wealth in full or in part . real estate used to park money that could not_be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition . Bubble value very hard to guess the total value of real estate shot up from $ 30T to $ 50T after covid when CPI says it should have gone to 38T so theres $ 12T of bubble value maybe unless the increase of prices is fundamental . stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA Id say TSLA is 90 % bubble but hard to say for NVDA . 50 % Anyway maybe $ 4T just for these then a bunch of other stocks at various bubble fractions . one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 2025 and todays value of 30 is bubble wealth so at least 20 % of the US market $ 14T is bubble wealth but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up with bargain hunters waiting to pile on . So lets not_count the high current PE or discount its bubbliness by a lot . The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly however . So there seems to be at least $ 20T of faithbased wealth out there perhaps 65 % of US GDP . The stock market lost $ 8T equivalent to $ 12T today in 2008 it lost $ 5T $ 10T today in 2000 . Housing lost something like $ 6T in 2008 suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of todays bubble wealth . Comments Are we in a record era bubble wealth Or is this the wrong way to look at things"

My average yearly ror over the past 14 years is %22 and my account size is around 550k. All i do is buy big name stocks and sell covered calls. When I look at ror of most hedge funds and traders i see it mostly much lower than mine why is that? Like am I really that good? Should i start a hedge fund? Or is there something i am missing here? I understand if you were trading with one 1 billion dollars it might become hard to get high ror the bigger you get but still, is it really that much?",

      "title": "BARK Inc., (NYSE:BARK) receives two buy-out proposals from current shareholders: the current ps discount offers a potential 22% gain with low risk",
      "selftext": "BARK Inc., is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to go-private in a all-cash transaction. The first proposal: BARK stock started 2025 at $2 with a continuous drop until $0.60. The Co-Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $0.60 and pushed the stock price down. A few weeks later, the CEO with the insiders made a go-private offer at $0.90 per share. They control nearly 39% of BARK already. Their offer was a relief for some retail holders, as it was nearly 50% higher than the current sp then. But, it was actually a low-ball offer for a artificially beaten down stock. The second proposal: In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $0.90, another major shareholder, Shay Capital, criticized the management and made two proposals: First, its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors, Second, a stock buy-back up to $25 million, as in their opinion, BARK stock price at $0.90 was very undervalued. A few days later than the CEO/insiders proposal at $0.90, Klugman with Marcus Lemonis (CEO of BBBY) made their buyout proposal at $1.10 per share. (Remember, Klugman does not accept the $0.90. He stated that in October. Then he said the sp at $0.90 is too low). So, there are two parties, already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders, who will try to acquire the company. They are both serious: \\-CEO/insiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a low-ball offer following it. \\-Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis. \\-Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff, a pet firm with retail stores. He grew Bentley with many acquisitions. Bentley sell pet foods, but don't make its own. BARK is making pet foods, so the synergies between these two are obvious. Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH, acquiring/delisting a company, merged it, re-listing it again. I think it will take time, but during times of uncertainty, the potential of a 22% gain from Klugman-Lemonis offer and the secured CEO/insiders offer bring a great risk/reward ratio. BARK currently trades at $0.89 and it dropped even at $0.85. These prices are below both offers. The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $1.10. Until then, both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down. Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th, but they are not important anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "BARK Inc. is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to goprivate in a allcash transaction . The first proposal BARK stock started 2025 at $ 2 with a continuous drop until $ 0.60 . The CoFounder Executive Chairman CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $ 0.60 and pushed the stock price down . A few weeks later the CEO with the insiders made a goprivate offer at $ 0.90 per share . They control nearly 39 % of BARK already . Their offer was a relief for some retail holders as it was nearly 50 % higher than the current sp then . But it was actually a lowball offer for a artificially beaten down stock . The second proposal In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $ 0.90 another major shareholder Shay Capital criticized the management and made two proposals First its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors Second a stock buyback up to $ 25 million as in their opinion BARK stock price at $ 0.90 was very undervalued . A few days later than the CEOinsiders proposal at $ 0.90 Klugman with Marcus Lemonis CEO of BBBY made their buyout proposal at $ 1.10 per share . Remember Klugman does not_accept the $ 0.90 . He stated that in October . Then he said the sp at $ 0.90 is too low . So there are two parties already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders who will try to acquire the company . They are both serious CEOinsiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a lowball offer following it . Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis . Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff a pet firm with retail stores . He grew Bentley with many acquisitions . Bentley sell pet foods but dont make its own . BARK is making pet foods so the synergies between these two are obvious . Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH acquiringdelisting a company merged it relisting it again . I think it will take time but during times of uncertainty the potential of a 22 % gain from KlugmanLemonis offer and the secured CEOinsiders offer bring a great riskreward ratio . BARK currently trades at $ 0.89 and it dropped even at $ 0.85 . These prices are below both offers . The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $ 1.10 . Until then both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down . Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th but they are not_important anymore ."

Some news outlets are framing the Federal Reserve’s latest fed chef replacement proposal as evidence that the dollar is becoming significantly stronger. I find that misleading. Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn’t signal a strong dollar especially not merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place. What we need is real fiscal progress, not just new faces saying things are improving. I’m not convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem. Given the current circumstances, is it an exaggeration to call the dollar ‘ becoming strong’?",

Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn ’ t signal a strong dollar especially not_merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place . What we need is real fiscal progress not_just new faces saying things are improving . I ’ m not_convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem .

I think especially as cannabis continues to be more widely accepted as a fun and harmless pastime in moderation video game demand will continue to climb . I think however that valuations are rich and the sentiment that personally have toward the sector is shared by many others American or not ."

I'd like to start moving some funds out of equities into something more stable to avoid SORR when I start to draw down my IRA. I was thinking just a money market or TBills, but my Fidelity rep suggested a three year SPDA. Apparently if you invest at least 100k, you can get a garenteed 4.3% interest over the 3 years. Obviously this is better than a CD or TBills at the moment. Does this sound too good to be true? I won't have to touch this before the 3 years, and this wouldn't be my sole vehicle for capital preservation. Have others purchased a SPDA through Fidelity?",
