      "selftext": "The term Black Swan gets used a lot in markets, but it often sounds more complicated than it needs to be. In simple terms, a Black Swan is an event that is rare, hard to predict and has a big impact. It is something most people are not positioned for, because it does not show up clearly in normal analysis. The key part is not just that it is rare. It is that when it happens it changes everything. Prices move fast, liquidity disappears and normal assumptions stop working. Black Swan risk is not about guessing the next crisis. It is about understanding that markets have weak points. When pressure hits those weak points, the reaction can be extreme. You do not need to live in fear of these events. You just need to respect that they exist and that ignoring them does not make them go away. When you hear the term Black Swan, do you think it is useful? or just a fancy label for bad surprises?",

But together, they raise a question about the underlying health of the market. \\*Strength in Consumer Staples\\*- In a healthy bull market there’s practically no demand for consumer staple stocks.

Last year, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLP) returned just 1.5%, compared to a 17.7% gain for the S&P 500. So far, in 2026, the script has flipped. Consumer staples are already up 6.5% year to date, while the S&P 500 is up just 1.5%. Compared to financials it looks worse. We don’t have bull markets without financials. When I see financials sitting at the bottom of the leaderboard as the worst performing sector to date, that gets my attention. That concern takes root at the same time consumer staples are showing strength. That combination is not what you see in a healthy bull market. It is certainly not sustainable. When we look at financials relative to consumer staples it becomes clearer. The ratio just hit new five year lows. The ratio has now fallen back below the prior highs of February and July of 2025, it has also lost a key pivot low from October. Former support is falling. That’s not great news if you are long the market. It’s not debatable. It’s not subtle. And it doesn’t look very good. If you are bullish you need to see this line snap back quickly. Not eventually. Not after a few more headlines. Quickly. When we see multiple warning signs stack up on each other, the burden of proof shifts. If these relationships don’t recover soon the market won’t need headlines to do the damage. The market will do damage on its own. Now you know what I do.",

      "title": "The Block (SQ) stock risk assessment :",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10-Ks and other news. I usually run it on companies I’m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks. I recently ran it on Block (SQ) given the recent volatility and the \"AI pivot and Crypto\" narrative. While the stock has momentum, the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines. I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them. 1. The \"Value Destruction\" Gap (ROIC vs. WACC) This was the loudest signal. This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): \\\\\\~0.76% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): \\\\\\~8.21% Despite reporting accounting profits, the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now. Operational returns aren't covering the cost of capital. Usually, you see this in dying industries, not \"growth\" fintechs. Is this just temporary due to the restructuring, or is the core payments business losing efficiency? 2. Cash Flow Quality: Organic or Accounting Magic? Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible: jumping from 101M to 1.7B (2024). The Red Flag: The tool flagged that this wasn't driven purely by higher sales. It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital. Receivables dropped from $7.19B → $5.67B. Payables fell from $141M → $118M. Retained Earnings swung wildly from -528M to +2.3B. This suggests the cash flow boom is largely \"one-off\" balance sheet timing (squeezing customers/suppliers) rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power. 3. The $11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill: $11.4B Intangibles: $1.4B Total: \\\\\\~35% of Total Assets. With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI, and away from legacy integrations, the tool flagged a high risk of impairment. If the acquisitions that make up that $11B (like Afterpay) underperform, we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity. 4. Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction. Long-term debt jumped from $4.97B to $6.4B. Simultaneously, they spent \\\\\\~$1.17B on equity repayments/buybacks. Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76% seems like questionable capital allocation. Conclusion: The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency (ROIC) is surprisingly weak. For those tracking SQ: Do you view the ROIC/WACC spread as a dealbreaker, or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffs/restructuring fully take effect?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10Ks and other news . I usually run it on companies I ’ m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks . I recently ran it on Block SQ given the recent volatility and the AI pivot and Crypto narrative . While the stock has momentum the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines . I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them . 1 . The Value Destruction Gap ROIC vs. WACC This was the loudest signal . This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost ROIC Return on Invested Capital 0.76 % WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital 8.21 % Despite reporting accounting profits the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now . Operational returns arent covering the cost of capital . Usually you see this in dying industries not_growth fintechs . Is this just temporary due to the restructuring or is the core payments business losing efficiency 2 . Cash Flow Quality Organic or Accounting Magic Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible jumping from 101M to 1.7B 2024 . The Red Flag The tool flagged that this wasnt driven purely by higher sales . It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital . Receivables dropped from $ 7.19B → $ 5.67B . Payables fell from $ 141M → $ 118M . Retained Earnings swung wildly from 528M to 2.3B . This suggests the cash flow boom is largely oneoff balance sheet timing squeezing customerssuppliers rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power . 3 . The $ 11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill $ 11.4B Intangibles $ 1.4B Total 35 % of Total Assets . With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI and away from legacy integrations the tool flagged a high risk of impairment . If the acquisitions that make up that $ 11B like Afterpay underperform we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity . 4 . Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction . Longterm debt jumped from $ 4.97B to $ 6.4B . Simultaneously they spent $ 1.17B on equity repaymentsbuybacks . Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76 % seems like questionable capital allocation . Conclusion The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency ROIC is surprisingly weak . For those tracking SQ Do you view the ROICWACC spread as a dealbreaker or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffsrestructuring fully take effect"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I've been digging into **ASP Isotopes (NASDAQ: ASPI)** and their subsidiary, **Quantum Leap Energy (QLE)**, and things are getting weird. For those out of the loop, QLE just filed a confidential S-1 for an IPO and they recently closed a **$64M private placement** led by American Ventures (the firm out of Trump Tower). Both **Eric and Don Jr.** are reportedly direct investors. Here is the setup: * **The Tech:** They are using laser-based enrichment (Quantum Enrichment) to produce **HALEU** for next-gen nuclear reactors. It’s basically the high-octane fuel needed for the SMRs that are supposed to power the AI data center boom. * **The Spin-off:** ASPI is spinning QLE out as its own entity but keeping a **10% perpetual revenue royalty**. * **The \"Regulatory Armor\":** Given the current administration's stance on energy independence and \"America First\" manufacturing, having the President's sons as backers feels like a massive hedge against regulatory hurdles for nuclear enrichment. **The Question:** Is ASPI a buy right now to capture the QLE \"dividend\" (since shareholders usually get shares in the spin-off)? Or is the $7.70+ price point already baking in too much of the \"Trump Premium\"? What do you think? Is the political connection a legitimate moat, or are we just watching a very expensive marketing campaign?",

This leads to Market maker hedging their sold options, by buying the shares of those ETFs which eventually drives up the artificially inflated prices. People are calling this rally as a Dollar debasement trade, however, behind the scenes just manipulation of some Wall Street traders is going on now. The government, Wall Street, media are all colluded. They orchestrate all such situations which leads to News on wars, AI bubble, inflation, weak dollar. This is exactly like 1970s , 2008 and now this rally. Buying physical gold at these prices does not make sense at all. Physical gold buying has already slowed down because of the purchasing power has exhausted. Now only central banks are the buyers.",

Yes they’re currently losing money but I think the market is missing the ramp up in revenue growth this year as they march towards profitability.

      "title": "Why the current state of the US Dollar is making me uncomfortable",
      "selftext": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession. The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy, evidenced by a 15% depreciation against the Euro since the term began. This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1% and rising geopolitical friction with the EU, which risks a selloff of US Treasuries. My thesis suggests two likely, yet negative, outcomes: **The Path of Non-Intervention** If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked, we risk a surge in commodity prices (already underway), leading to cost-push inflation. While oil supply may mitigate some shocks, a severe spike could threaten the solvency of import-dependent nations. Furthermore, this dynamic encourages \"currency wars,\" where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive. This erosion of trust could destroy international trade, ultimately leading to stagflation and recession. **The Path of Delayed Intervention** If the US government eventually intervenes, it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late. This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures, similar to the \"Volcker Shock\" hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation. Alternatively, they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity. Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable. I'm struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar, I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade, I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy. I am seeking feedback on this assessment: Is this thesis economically sound, or am I overestimating the risks? I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the US's narrative might make sense.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have growing concerns regarding the current state of the US Dollar and its potential to trigger a global recession . The current administration has openly prioritized a weak dollar policy evidenced by a 15 % depreciation against the Euro since the term began . This is compounded by political pressure on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to 1 % and rising geopolitical friction with the EU which risks a selloff of US Treasuries . My thesis suggests two likely yet negative outcomes The Path of NonIntervention If the dollar continues to devalue unchecked we risk a surge in commodity prices already underway leading to costpush inflation . While oil supply may mitigate some shocks a severe spike could threaten the solvency of importdependent nations . Furthermore this dynamic encourages currency wars where trading partners devalue their own currencies to remain competitive . This erosion of trust could destroy international trade ultimately leading to stagflation and recession . The Path of Delayed Intervention If the US government eventually intervenes it will likely be a reactive measure taken too late . This would force the Federal Reserve to enact drastic measures similar to the Volcker Shock hiking rates aggressively to curb inflation . Alternatively they might attempt to absorb massive amounts of liquidity . Both approaches would freeze capital expenditure and tighten the economy so severely that a crisis becomes inevitable . Im struggling to see how the current narrative of the administration is avoiding to change their path for the Dollar I understand how a small devaluation makes you more competitive when it comes to international trade I feel we have reached the point where the constant weakening of the Dollar against all other currencies stops favoring the US and just starts destroying the global economy . I am seeking feedback on this assessment Is this thesis economically sound or am I overestimating the risks I basically want to hear the rest of the people so I can atleast start seeing other points of views on how the USs narrative might make sense ."

      "selftext": "I have traded mostly stocks, ETFs and Options last year (around 200 executed orders in 2025) with a reasonable level of success (in a bull market anyone is a hero). Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early. I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy: # Overview: * Goal: 20%/year target return * Time horizon: 5 years * Max Drawdown: 25% # Additional constrains: * No single trade above 1% of portfolio total * Per-Ticker Limits: 10% single stock/20% single ETF * Asset type concentration limits: Stocks: 35%/ETFs: 45%/Options: 20% # Sector Allocations (soft limits): * Information Technology: 35% * Energy: 5% * Large Blend: 30% (mostly for indexed ETFs - VOO, etc...) * Other sectors: 30% # How I plan on implement the rules: 1. All assets held must have a stop-loss/trailing stop-loss set at 15%-20% of either current price or entry price (use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value) 2. Option count against underlying ticker concentration - *100 Shares of NVDA + 1 short Put NVDA Contract = 200 share commitment.* 3. If total stock allocation is met, use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20% limit As I'm investing across a range of account types (401K Traditional and Brokerage, Roth IRA, Taxable Brokerage, HSA), there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them. It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage, while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage. I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional. I don't understand Options enough to operate multi-leg strategies so I don't play with them. # Current portfolio: Current stocks held in descending order of value: NVDA, PLTR, NOW, SMCI, CALM, GOOG, IREN, ADBE, OKTA, FISV, SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value: IWB, VOO, MGK, SMH Current open option contracts: Long LEAPS on the following underlying: NVO, NVDA, PLTR, NOK, KLAR, KVUE/A few Covered Calls on SMH, NOW, IREN, OKTA # Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits, I would like to get feedback on the overall framework. Specific questions: \\- Should I tighten up the stop-loss limit on Stocks/ETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stop-loss limits for LEAPS/Options - keeping the 25% drawdown total? \\- Should I consider stashing 5% os total invested in corporate bonds (ETF along the lines of IGIB) as dry powder to buy significant dips? \\- Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made? \\- Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "I have traded mostly stocks ETFs and Options last year around 200 executed orders in 2025 with a reasonable level of success in a bull market anyone is a hero . Reviewing the trades it became clear I let my losers run too long and cut some winners short too early . I have set myself a goal of being more disciplined in trading this year and came up with the following strategy Overview Goal 20 % year target return Time horizon 5 years Max Drawdown 25 % Additional constrains No_single trade above 1 % of portfolio total PerTicker Limits 10 % single stock20 % single ETF Asset type concentration limits Stocks 35 % ETFs 45 % Options 20 % Sector Allocations soft limits Information Technology 35 % Energy 5 % Large Blend 30 % mostly for indexed ETFs VOO etc ... Other sectors 30 % How I plan on implement the rules 1 . All assets held must have a stoplosstrailing stoploss set at 15 % 20 % of either current price or entry price use TA to identify support levels near the trigger value 2 . Option count against underlying ticker concentration 100 Shares of NVDA 1 short Put NVDA Contract 200 share commitment . 3 . If total stock allocation is met use LEAPS as stock replacement up to the 20 % limit As Im investing across a range of account types 401K Traditional and Brokerage Roth IRA Taxable Brokerage HSA there are differences in types of operations I can make in each one of them . It gets a bit complicated but I try to use LEAPS across Roth IRA and Taxable Brokerage while I can Wheel assets on the 401K Brokerage . I need to stick with the selection of mutual funds in 401K traditional . I dont understand Options enough to operate multileg strategies so I dont play with them . Current portfolio Current stocks held in descending order of value NVDA PLTR NOW SMCI CALM GOOG IREN ADBE OKTA FISV SPT Current ETFs held in descending order of value IWB VOO MGK SMH Current open option contracts Long LEAPS on the following underlying NVO NVDA PLTR NOK KLAR KVUEA few Covered Calls on SMH NOW IREN OKTA Feedback Request Before I implement the strategy and limits I would like to get feedback on the overall framework . Specific questions Should I tighten up the stoploss limit on StocksETFs and use the slack to broaden up the stoploss limits for LEAPSOptions keeping the 25 % drawdown total Should I consider stashing 5 % os total invested in corporate bonds ETF along the lines of IGIB as dry powder to buy significant dips Any glaring holes or immediate improvements to be made Anyone operates under a similar framework and can share experience Thanks"

In my own research all I've been able to find is that there is an ETF, among other symbols listed on the LSE as QUAD, which appears to hold an 11% portfolio density in this company. I've bought that ETF, but I would be interested to have a slightly more concentrated play in that company, even if it means some logistical upkeep. I trade with IBKR in the UK (they don't support Korean stocks) and Fidelity in the USA (I couldn't find any ADR). I'm happy to sign up with a new broker if that's what it would take. thanks",

Ive bought that ETF but I would be interested to have a slightly more concentrated play in that company even if it means some logistical upkeep . I trade with IBKR in the UK they dont support Korean stocks and Fidelity in the USA I couldnt find any ADR . Im happy to sign up with a new broker if thats what it would take . thanks"

      "selftext": "Today CMS (Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services) proposed MA (Medicare Advantage) reimbursement rate increase of 0.09% for 2027, well below the expected 6%. This lead to $92B market cap wipeout today across health insurance stocks including UNH -20% CVS -15% CNC -11% HUM -20%. This is a complete no go because MA margins are already squeezed and MA plans have been a growth driver for the industry. According to [PWC]( in 2024 MA plans had an underwriting margin of -1% on average (meaning providers were losing money) and over 70% of the enrollees are breakeven or in loss. I contacted a health actuary friend who said that they expect Trump to back down after pressure from the industry. They also don't think the reported negative margin is accurate because MA plans have been a big revenue driver in the industry. CMS will publish the final rate on April 6. That leaves plenty of time for the industry to lobby for a more appropriate rate increase. This is very similar to Trump's 10% CC cap proposal, where he is just spewing some anti industry populist message without thinking about the math and numbers. The total rebate in 2024 was about $78B (I have trouble finding the exact figure), so the missing 5.91% increase comes out to the ballpark of $4.6B (in 2024 basis) on the line for the industry. And because this is an increase rate, any reduced rate this year will compound indefinitely into the future. TDLR TACO buy the dip [Positions: IHF 25 x $45.62 IHF 5/15/2026 49.0 C 20 x $1.16]( Not a large position because I find healthcare plays boring.",

      "selftext": "Super Micro Computer (SMCI) - a stock that has burned Retail Traders and Wall Street analysts, has confirmed Q2 earnings for 2/3/26 after market close. They are forecasted to announce revenue $10-11 B and EPS $.45-$.54. At a $18B market cap, this is very attractive valuation for an AI stock, even an AI stock on the wrong end of the chip business. However, Wall Street does not believe a word they are saying. After 2 years of earnings misses and declining margins, SMCI is poised to explode either up or down. My completely uneducated and NOT FINANCIAL advice suggests SMCI stock is going to either $15 or $50 in the next two weeks. Acting on this hypothesis, I have opened a 2-13-26 dated $30 straddle position. Please balance your risk and reward and diversify your stock portfolio.",

I remember when semiconductor stocks were being talked about everywhere in 2016 (when they were unknown and lowkey) all the nerds were posting legit analysis about DRAM prices, implementation in various hardware products, how it would track with the crypto boom due to CPUs/GPUs, etc. seriously, how is Reddit goin to make money? the ads are irrelevant and from no name companies. I see the same posts reposted 5x a week to karma farm “whats the biggest regret of your life” lmfao i love Reddit (the subreddit niches helped me alot in my career and early life) and normally buy what use, but the concerns are genuine. AI and bot posts are way more common, constantly reposts of the same shit, and this place in general is a liberal echo box which will deter the masses downvote all you want but this is a public company now, to capture the young demographic entirely I’m sure they don’t want to log-in everyday and see a post on [r/all](/r/all/) about ONLY vaccines and left wing propoganda. Why the fuck is the number one post some corny picture of a soilder Punching a nazi? it should be something trendy and relevant like that idiot clavicular EDIT: do you guys SEE what i MEAN? isnt the controversy and polarizing opinion of MINE getting the JUICES FLOWING and real human emotion involved thus higher comments and replies in this post? there should be 100,000 of me, i cant do this alone. this is what reddit should turn into, not an echobox full of censoring, not AI slop, not 10 posts a day about why i should get vaccinated. i want to log into [r/all]( one day and see dslr pics of a trump rally and another being a post about how those who didnt get the covid vaccine will die in 5 years. im tired of logging in everyday and seeing the same post \"people in their 30s, what do you regret in your 20s\" or ONLY \"Study: why letting my 12 year old son chop his weiner off and change genders will reduce his depression rate\" [u/spez]( hire me i know how to get the job done, let me take this bad boy to $1k a share",

      "title": "Does flexibility meaningfully improve long-term portfolio outcomes, or is full investment still optimal?",
      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during stress periods. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress, depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over extended periods idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing drawdown deployment or reduced forced selling during stress periods . While this approach may lower expected returns it could potentially improve riskadjusted outcomes and reduce forced selling during market stress depending on how it is implemented . From a structural perspective this raises a broader question should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management or simply an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize For those focused on long horizons how do you think about this tradeoff in practice Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, My father retired recently and has about ₹1 crore saved up. We’re trying to be very conservative with this money. The main goal is: Capital should stay safe No stock market or risky investments Monthly income of around ₹80k–₹1 lakh to manage regular expenses Minimal monitoring and no stress Basically looking for something stable where the money stays intact and generates a predictable monthly income. Just wanted to understand from people here: Is this kind of monthly income realistic without taking risk? If yes, what kind of options should we look at? If not, what would be a sensible expectation from a completely safe setup? Would really appreciate advice from anyone who has dealt with retirement planning or similar situations. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "While any specific thoughts on the individual stock (CENX/Century Aluminum) are welcome, I'm also/more broadly interested in how folks handle your unexpected wins that wildly exceed your expectations especially in the realm of small caps where you readily realize you just got lucky. FWIW, my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio -- I am no pro, nor any kind of day trader and mostly, I stick with large/mega caps. Still, I always told myself \"If you can't keep pace with the S&P, you've just got an expensive hobby\". Over 6 years now - I've held my own or better, thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL. Anyway, I don't usually bother with small caps - but \\~3 years ago, I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 2021/2022 infrastructure/manufacturing bills. CENX was one of the names mentioned. I read more - they had some aggressive expansion plans, including some new tech/methods. I did - as I always try to do - pored over the 10-K/10-Qs and thought the finances looked solid. Bought in further in 2024 - quite clear no matter who won the election, such public investment wasn't going away. I wouldn't ask this sort of question about large caps, but small caps... oy. Not a charts guy, but short% creeping towards 20%. CENX missed earnings throughout 2025, but still had an unbelievable year price-wise. Sector averages on P/E, now even growth? Don't look good. And worst of all? \"Materials\" is just not a sector I'm familiar with. My *gut* \\- every ounce of it - says take the money and run... I'm now, total cash basis - up nearly 500%, long on all positions. What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money. However, my gut isn't always very smart. And I'm really just a \"buy-and-hold\" guy. AND - as the title says, I believe in \"cut your weeds, not your flowers\". Like I said, any specific thoughts on it are welcome -- but more broadly, ***especially*** from more seasoned investors. How and when do you decide that even your \"winners\" have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to \"safer\" investments? Or - do you not? Even crashing out - the position here wouldn't hurt me in the grand scheme.",

FWIW my brokerage account I used for individual stock picks is a pretty tiny portion of my overall portfolio I am no_pro nor any kind of day trader and mostly I stick with largemega caps . Still I always told myself If you cant keep pace with the SP youve just got an expensive hobby . Over 6 years now Ive held my own or better thanks largely to getting in early on NVDA and standard stalwarts like AMZN and AAPL . Anyway I dont usually bother with small caps but 3 years ago I read an interesting article in Kiplinger about potential under the radar beneficiaries of the 20212022 infrastructuremanufacturing bills . CENX was one of the names mentioned . I read more they had some aggressive expansion plans including some new techmethods . I did as I always try to do pored over the 10K10Qs and thought the finances looked solid . Bought in further in 2024 quite clear no_matter who won the election such public investment wasnt going away . I wouldnt ask this sort of question about large caps but small caps ... oy . Not_a charts guy but short % creeping towards 20 % . CENX missed earnings throughout 2025 but still had an unbelievable year pricewise . Sector averages on PE now even growth Dont look good . And worst of all Materials is just not_a sector Im familiar with . My gut every ounce of it says take the money and run ... Im now total cash basis up nearly 500 % long on all positions . What was really a pretty small total investment has suddenly become real money . However my gut isnt always very smart . And Im really just a buyandhold guy . AND as the title says I believe in cut your weeds not_your flowers . Like I said any specific thoughts on it are welcome but more broadly especially from more seasoned investors . How and when do you decide that even your winners have exceeded expectations and you start to wonder whether its time to take the profits and reallocate to safer investments Or do you not_Even crashing out the position here wouldnt hurt me in the grand scheme ."

      "selftext": "Back in May of last year when all the tariff stuff was going on I KNEW eventually everything would be going back up. I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever, I said we will never see these lows again. However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $35 down to $30 in 2 days, a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures. Had about $600,000 (I am not even rich, I just had won a lot in sports betting, put it in the market and made even more) and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $29.75. For that amount of futures it is $210,000 for every dollar silver moved, had it gone back up to just $35 it was 2 days ago I would up $1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years, I thought would get to $50 or so and make a killing..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $28 and dropped all the way to $27.54 a low that will never be seen again. At that point I was down $460,000 and all but wiped out = a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD. About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $30.02 for a $50,000 profit. I had no choice, I couldn't take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out, my dreams of holding for the long term was over. I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $100+. I knew it was going back up (i thought maybe $50, never though $100), I knew I wanted to hold it forever. If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $14 million dollars on the 41 contracts. But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up. I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $100 Million dollars on this trade. And that puts me as the #1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub. I know it would happen, I made the trade, and I still lost all my money Have a good day",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in May of last year when all the tariff stuff was going on I KNEW eventually everything would be going back up . I wanted to buy Nasdaq futures and just hold them forever I said we will never_see these lows again . However Silver futures at the time got trounced from $ 35 down to $ 30 in 2 days a once in a lifetime move at the time so I decided to go all in and put every penny I had into silver futures . Had about $ 600000 I am not_even rich I just had won a lot in sports betting put it in the market and made even more and I bought 41 Silver future contracts on a Friday for about $ 29.75 . For that amount of futures it is $ 210000 for every dollar silver moved had it gone back up to just $ 35 it was 2 days ago I would up $ 1 million dollars but I was ready to hold it for years I thought would get to $ 50 or so and make a killing ..... By the time the market opened up on Sunday night the futures got crushed and opened even lower at $ 28 and dropped all the way to $ 27.54 a low that will never_be seen again . At that point I was down $ 460000 and all but wiped out a few more ticks lower and it would have been a margin call and automatic sale from TD . About to go broke I said a prayer and low and behold the market rallied and not_even 3 hours later I actually sold the futures at $ 30.02 for a $ 50000 profit . I had no_choice I couldnt take the chance it dropped again and wipe me out my dreams of holding for the long term was over . I moved on and in grand tard fashion ended up losing every single penny of that money on other futures and options trades over the next month But the killer is Silver made the move I knew would happen and is now $ 100 . I knew it was going back up i thought maybe $ 50 never_though $ 100 I knew I wanted to hold it forever . If I was able to hold it until now that that would be a profit of over $ 14 million dollars on the 41 contracts . But even worse my plan was that as I made profits I would just keep buying more futures as it went up . I would have had at least 500 contracts by now easily would have made over $ 100 Million dollars on this trade . And that puts me as the 1 grand tard of all the grand tards in this sub . I know it would happen I made the trade and I still lost all my money Have a good day"

      "selftext": "Hey all, So, just a bit about myself & my investing journey: I'm from Hong Kong & was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad, Poor Dad. Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were \"gambling\", I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with & had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset. I never started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 & even then, I was a very conservative investor & only invested about US$130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank (HSBC) - I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didn't know how to open an investment account & was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account. (What a waste of an opportunity.) Later that year, I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing (At one point, he wanted to go all in on one stock.) As I was risk averse, I never attempted to try picking stocks with my own money & as it turned out, using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor, my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time - I looked into BYD, NIO, PLTR, MARA, DDD, OCGN, GME. Fast forward 5 years & my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts & reading investing books. I've managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month & the more financial content I consume, the more I realize that I'm more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker. I still haven't started picking stocks & I can't help but beat myself up for not taking the risk back then. The hindsight bias has been brutal & taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return could've been but anyway, would've, could've, should've, I understand Hindsight is 20/20. I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head: * Am I bad at taking risks? * How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner? (Was I too harsh on myself?) * Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking & the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in? * How do I learn from the experience & most importantly, moving forward, how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey & rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias I've been struggling with for some time now? I would love all your feedback & opinions on this & would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share. (It would definitely help a lot!)",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey all So just a bit about myself my investing journey Im from Hong Kong was first introduced to investing at 13 after reading bits of Rich Dad Poor Dad . Having an older baby boomer British father who always thought stocks were gambling I struggled with the scarcity mindset that I was brought up with had to take the longest time trying to change this mindset . I never_started investing till I was about 22 back in 2020 even then I was a very conservative investor only invested about US $ 130 a month into a unit trust fund from my bank HSBC I blame my lack of financial literacy at the time as I didnt know how to open an investment account was so hesitant to transfer money out of my bank account . What a waste of an opportunity . Later that year I got thrust into the world of speculation after being asked to recommend stocks by a friend who wanted a very aggressive approach with his investing At one point he wanted to go all in on one stock . As I was risk averse I never_attempted to try picking stocks with my own money as it turned out using Reddit as my main source of information as a retail investor my stock picks were actually winners if I had sold them at the right time at the time I looked into BYD NIO PLTR MARA DDD OCGN GME . Fast forward 5 years my financial literacy has improved as I spent hours listening to finance podcasts reading investing books . Ive managed to put in consistently put money into VT each month the more financial content I consume the more I realize that Im more geared towards being a broad index investor rather than a stock picker . I still havent started picking stocks I cant help but beat myself up for not_taking the risk back then . The hindsight bias has been brutal taxing to my mental health knowing how life changing the potential return couldve been but anyway wouldve couldve shouldve I understand Hindsight is 2020 . I still have these lingering questions at the back of my head Am I bad at taking risks How do I make of this experience when I was an absolute beginner Was I too harsh on myself Should I even be trying to pick stocks based on Reddit advice knowing how indecisive I can be making such decisions as we all know markets are forward looking the stock prices have the possibility of already being priced in How do I learn from the experience most importantly moving forward how do I develop the CORRECT mindset for my investing journey rid myself of the regret from the hindsight bias Ive been struggling with for some time now I would love all your feedback opinions on this would love to know if you have any stories related to this that you would be happy to share . It would definitely help a lot"

      "selftext": "India's oil minister says US-India talks are \"very advanced,\" eyeing a quick sign-off. But Trump's crew is slamming 50% tariffs on Indian goods (punishing Russian oil buys) and criticizing the new EU-India \"mother of all deals.\" Is this a breakthrough or a trap that spikes China tensions and tanks EM funds? Bearish vibes strong. Even platforms like Bitget with tokenized stocks are mirroring the volatility in Indian equities amid these tariff threats. Key red flags are piling up based on fresh reports: the U.S. has already hammered India with 50% duties on certain goods, while Treasury pick Scott Bessent blasts the EU-India FTA as \"financing war against themselves\" through indirect Russia ties, and Trump's broader threats, like 100% tariffs on Canada and 25% on South Korea, could easily escalate the mess. Meanwhile, the EU-India power move, a landmark deal slashing tariffs on 96.6% of goods and boosting EU exports to India, significantly reduces U.S. leverage according to experts. This geopolitical fallout might heighten U.S.-China friction even further, putting intense pressure on emerging market ETFs like INDA and EEM through potential outflows. If it lands, it could stabilize supply chains and boost bilateral trade (currently \\~$200B), giving U.S. firms better access to India's market amid China decoupling. But experts like former trade officials say the EU deal gives India \"immediate price advantages,\" making U.S. negotiations tougher. what's your take? Is the deal a done thing, or will tariffs kill it?",

It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults. >The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09% in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage, far below Wall Street's expectations. >This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana, CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12% before the bell. >CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April. If the current proposal holds, the rate increase would result in more than $700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027. >UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $17.75, compared with analysts' average estimate of $17.74, according to data compiled by LSEG. >The company has struggled with higher costs across government-backed ⁠plans for over two years, driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services, specialty drugs and home-health ​services. >For the year, adjusted medical care ratio - the percentage of premiums spent on medical care - was 88.9% compared with 85.5% in 2024. Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1% ⁠for 2025. >The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding, changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends, the company said. >On ⁠an adjusted basis, UnitedHealth earned a fourth-quarter profit of $2.11 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.10, ‌according to data compiled by LSEG.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source UnitedHealth on Tuesday forecast 2026 adjusted profit slightly above analysts estimates in a sign that medical costcontrol measures under CEO Stephen ​Hemsley were beginning to reap results . Hemsley who returned as CEO in May to restore ‌investor and consumer trust in the healthcare behemoth has been working to steer the company out of a ‌difficult period that included the murder of a top executive a surge in medical costs a federal probe and Americans anger at insurance industry practices . The company has been aiming for a return to growth in 2026 but expects a challenging recovery in its Medicaid business for ⁠lowerincome Americans due to a ‌mismatch between payment rates and costs for medical services . It has also pulled back on Medicare Advantage offerings for older adults . The U.S. on ‍Monday proposed an average rate increase of 0.09 % in payments to private insurers next year for the Medicare Advantage plans they manage far below Wall Streets expectations . This sent shares of top insurers ​Humana CVS Health and UnitedHealth down more than 12 % before the bell . CMS typically ‌finalizes Medicare Advantage rates in early April . If the current proposal holds the rate increase would result in more than $ 700 million in payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2027 . UnitedHealth sees annual profit per share of greater than $ 17.75 compared with analysts average estimate of $ 17.74 according to data compiled by LSEG . The company has struggled with higher costs across governmentbacked ⁠plans for over two years driven by increased utilization ​of behavioral health services specialty drugs and homehealth ​services . For the year adjusted medical care ratio the percentage of premiums spent on medical care was 88.9 % compared with 85.5 % in 2024 . Analysts on ‍average had expected 89.1 % ⁠for 2025 . The increase was driven by a reduction in Medicare funding changes from the Inflation Reduction Act combined with accelerating medical cost trends the company said . On ⁠an adjusted basis UnitedHealth earned a fourthquarter profit of $ 2.11 per share compared with analysts average estimate of $ 2.10 ‌according to data compiled by LSEG ."

Since then I've been diversifying - etf, bonds and fu\\*\\* stock picking. And this last one is killing me. I want to buy a new house in the next 3y and I know I'm not going make a fortune from all that money... but hey, look at sandisk. What if I bought 100 shares a year ago? I decided since the beginning that I'm on the market for long term, but at the same time I lost some money for bad decisions (quantum computing, pinterest) and lost important money for my house. This thoughts are killing me. I wanted to surf the wave, make good money and leave. I have a friend who's always green - always making money - essentially surfing this market. No financial background, just surfing. I don't want that risk... but he has been soooo lucky. And I'm not. He doesn't do any company analysis. He doesn't care about earnings... on the other side, In the past 3 months I've been spending too much energy creating python scripts to analyse companies, earnings, ps ratio, dilution, etc...... too much energy. At the same time I know I'm right: focused ln the long term. But the other side is saying: you could also surf this bull marker wave and make money. And you're not. You could put money in Siemens Energy at 75€ (seriously I had the opportunity) but I didn't because I didn't know if I should. Now it's \"just\" 141€. Felling guilty, feeling I'm loosing the wave... because seems a good opportunity, and I know we don't know the future. My friend goes from the \"feeling\", and succeeded. I try to understand things and could make money, and I'm not. Feeling anxious because could making good money, an extra help for my house and I'm not. Feel lost sometimes. I don't want to beat the market, I know I can't . I'm always with yahoo finance open, tracking news and companies, trying to undertsif it's a good time to invest in a company. I don't want to be a gambler, but feel that if I would (with some money) I could have more money. beeing rich is not the main poin here.",

      "title": "The silver market is making moves that don’t make sense anymore",
      "selftext": "The swings in silver over the last day have been nothing short of extreme. Within roughly 14 hours, silver saw close to $2 trillion in market cap swing back and forth. Early in the US session it added around $500B, only to give back almost $1T a few hours later, and then rally another $500B again into the evening. That's so insane lol. To put that into perspective: silver was effectively tossing around Bitcoin’s entire market cap multiple times in a single day. This kind of volatility isn’t normal for a market that’s usually viewed as slow, defensive, and macro-driven. It raises some uncomfortable questions about positioning, leverage, and how fragile liquidity really is right now. Curious how others are viewing this. Is this purely speculative flow, forced positioning unwinds, or a sign that stress is building under the surface of broader markets?",

      "selftext": "Recently the Colombian market has started to rebound mainly due to peso strengthening against a weak dollar and inflows from emerging market investment. Recently the bank of colombia has taken large amounts of external debts at high interest rates artificially propping up the peso making Colombia one of the highest interest payers in dollars in the world relative to their exports. If you look at a 15 year chart comparing $COLO to ClW00(continuous crude oil) you see in 2015 it crashed 70% from the U.s starting to raise rates as well as crude oil prices crashing. If you look at the chart now you can see the huge divergence. I believe the Colombian president is artificially propping up the peso for his party because the election is in a few months as well as this year he raised minimum wage 22% to $550 a month. The economy is incredibly vulnerable with the Colombian bank rate at 9.5% and their inflation sticking at 5%, they will eventually be either forced raising interest rates driving out foreign investment with their unemployment rate already at 8-9% or printing their way out which is a bad idea since their external loans have high interest and their export industry is already struggling.",

      "selftext": "Here is a DD, fellow window lickers. The Europoors have an investible asset for once. The pride of the Italian construction worker & Dubai sheikh. Ferrari: $RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis. Its business model, demand dynamics, and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any mass-market OEM. Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings, while Ferrari trades closer to the mid-thirties at the moment. Based on trailing EPS, a Hermès-level earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels. The gap is not due to inferior fundamentals, but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand. Ferrari’s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector. The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not meaningfully impacted by interest rates, inflation, or consumer credit conditions. For their customers, availability, allocation, and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations, . As a result, revenue stability, pricing power, and margins behave more like high-end luxury goods than cyclical vehicles. Order books remain deep, consistently extending beyond two years. Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts, allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game. Taking delivery of a less-desired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow. This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model, where customers accept less sought-after references to build credibility with the brand, and where the real product being sold is not the object itself but the access. Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of short-term sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance. Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches, but projected units, mix, and pricing still support the broader earnings profile. F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end, and the release does not carry long-term revenue consequences. The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals. The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestment/production reduction in EVs. This should be positive with the current political climate. Regardless, who tf wants a EV Ferrari? It should be easily priced at $500. The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead, I’m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly.

      "selftext_processed": "Here is a DD fellow window lickers . The Europoors have an investible asset for once . The pride of the Italian construction worker Dubai sheikh . Ferrari $ RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis . Its business model demand dynamics and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any massmarket OEM . Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings while Ferrari trades closer to the midthirties at the moment . Based on trailing EPS a Hermèslevel earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels . The gap is not_due to inferior fundamentals but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand . Ferrari ’ s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector . The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not_meaningfully impacted by interest rates inflation or consumer credit conditions . For their customers availability allocation and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations . As a result revenue stability pricing power and margins behave more like highend luxury goods than cyclical vehicles . Order books remain deep consistently extending beyond two years . Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game . Taking delivery of a lessdesired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow . This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model where customers accept less soughtafter references to build credibility with the brand and where the real product being sold is not_the object itself but the access . Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of shortterm sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance . Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches but projected units mix and pricing still support the broader earnings profile . F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end and the release does not_carry longterm revenue consequences . The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals . The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestmentproduction reduction in EVs . This should be positive with the current political climate . Regardless who tf wants a EV Ferrari It should be easily priced at $ 500 . The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead I ’ m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly .

      "selftext": "I'm seriously thinking about dumping all my Bitcoin at a loss, but I want to make sure its a good idea first. I've been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24% loss for around 6 months or more, and I'm starting to think it was a bad investment. I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks. However, Bitcoin hasn't lived up to my expectations. I'll be honest, mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right, and up into the right is good lol, but now it isn't. Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation, mainly with major world banks buying it up. The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I, so I can't go against their game. Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock (I don't understand this too well I could be wrong). More and more I'm thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin. What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have? What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later? I know its obviously a currency, but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web. At least with gold and silver, you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry. Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar, since you can't really buy goods and services with silver and gold. But then again, maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver. I want to know what you guys think. I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not be seeing the whole picture.",

Ive been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24 % loss for around 6 months or more and Im starting to think it was a bad investment . I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks . However Bitcoin hasnt lived up to my expectations . Ill be honest mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right and up into the right is good lol but now it isnt . Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation mainly with major world banks buying it up . The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I so I cant go against their game . Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock I dont understand this too well I could be wrong . More and more Im thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin . What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later I know its obviously a currency but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web . At least with gold and silver you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry . Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar since you cant really buy goods and services with silver and gold . But then again maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver . I want to know what you guys think . I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not_be seeing the whole picture ."

      "selftext": "Been digging into Alphabet's financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative. This isn't investment advice, just my analysis. The headline numbers look great: Net income up 36% YoY to $100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $125.3B Stock up \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~65% in 2025 But here's what's getting buried: 1. Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63% ($32.3B → $52.5B) while cash on hand stayed flat at $23.5B. Net income is up, but FCF margin is declining. That's a red flag most screens won't catch. 2. Hidden leverage nobody talks about Long-term debt looks manageable at $10.9B. But capital lease obligations are $14.6B more than the debt itself. All those data centers aren't free. 3. Liquidity is shifting long-term at the worst time Short-term investments dropped from $86.9B to $72.2B while long-term investments increased. They're locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking. 4. AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Here's the contrarian take: AI-generated answers bypass traditional ad clicks. Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue, but it could redistribute value within Google's ecosystem rather than expand it. 5. Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9% YoY. If those AI/Cloud contracts have delayed payment milestones, working capital strain could hit during any downturn. 6. Governance risk is real Dual-class structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want. Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy. Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings. If you're a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals. There are tools to surface these kinds of non-obvious risks. Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into Alphabets financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative . This isnt investment advice just my analysis . The headline numbers look great Net income up 36 % YoY to $ 100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $ 125.3B Stock up 65 % in 2025 But heres whats getting buried 1 . Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63 % $ 32.3B → $ 52.5B while cash on hand stayed flat at $ 23.5B . Net income is up but FCF margin is declining . Thats a red flag most screens wont catch . 2 . Hidden leverage nobody_talks about Longterm debt looks manageable at $ 10.9B . But capital lease obligations are $ 14.6B more than the debt itself . All those data centers arent free . 3 . Liquidity is shifting longterm at the worst time Shortterm investments dropped from $ 86.9B to $ 72.2B while longterm investments increased . Theyre locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking . 4 . AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Heres the contrarian take AIgenerated answers bypass traditional ad clicks . Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue but it could redistribute value within Googles ecosystem rather than expand it . 5 . Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9 % YoY . If those AICloud contracts have delayed payment milestones working capital strain could hit during any downturn . 6 . Governance risk is real Dualclass structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want . Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy . Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings . If youre a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals . There are tools to surface these kinds of nonobvious risks . Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently"

A $3T company has more influence than a $100M micro-cap. I initially used FMP's sector_performance data (simple averages) but got garbage. +73% single-day sector returns from micro-cap noise. ETFs reflect actual investable returns. --- **Results** | Metric | Count | |:-------|:------| | Total year-over-year transitions | 246 | | Bottom-3 → Top-3 next year | 27 (11%) | | Top-3 → Bottom-3 next year | 34 (14%) | | Major reversals (either direction) | 61 (25%) | No sector stayed #1 for more than 2 consecutive years. --- **Recent rankings (2024-2026)** | Year | #1 | #2 | #3 | Worst | |:-----|:---|:---|:---|:------| | 2024 | Comm Services (+36%) | Financials | Consumer Disc | Materials (0%) | | 2025 | Technology (+25%) | Comm Services | Industrials | Utilities (-43%) | | 2026 YTD | Materials (+7%) | Energy | Consumer Staples | Financials (-2%) | Materials: worst in 2024, leading 2026 YTD.

A family is considering allocating $1–2 million into a long-term investment vehicle with the objective of generating a sustainable \\~5% annual return while preserving capital. What types of instruments or structures would be appropriate to achieve this goal over a long time horizon? EDIT: Sorry if my post sounded confusing. Background is that I would like to secure my family's future and organize some sort of trust fund or something like that so we would have some sort of passive income. I now use CDs but the rates are not great and they will probably go lower. I want to keep 5% at min, and I would like to increase the asset base (insh) in the coming years. So that's the background. I am not familiar with any firms or advisors, so I think I will talk to Schwab or someone similar. Anyone who gave advice, I am greatful. I am a trader and I have been in the markets since 2013. Actively since 2017, and I am 42. So trying to plan my fams future. That's it. Don't want to take market risk, as I have plenty of capital under risk daily anyways.",

It’s @ 4.80 yesterday was 6.00. 2: PL 36 Call EXP: May.15.2026 bought for 2.85 It’s @ 2.10 yesterday was 2.80. Personally I love this company and will be investing long term. If you guys can help that would be great but no pressure. My question is 1) How bad would PL be affected by the government shutdown If it happens, I imagine pretty bad right? 2) If a government shutdown occurs that would lead me to believe we entered a bearish market? 3) Should I just sell or hold? I don’t mind selling and I am more worried about waiting. Hope you guys/gals have a good one!",

      "selftext": "Looks like he's not done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada. Load up on your stocks boys because it'll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow [From NBC]( President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25% from 15%, complaining that the nation's legislature wasn't \"living up\" to a trade deal that was struck last year. \"Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%,\" Trump wrote in a social media post. Trump's announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living. His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation, and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties. South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States, ranking among the top 10 sources of imports. Nearly $150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers. In July, Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Korea's president. However, the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for. Then in October, during Trump's Asia trip, he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal, which included a promise of investing $350 billion in the U.S. Weeks later, in November, the White House and South Korean government released a \"fact sheet\" that was set to put the deal in motion. [Edit] For anyone interested, in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense, I've setup r/TrumpTariffTracker. Any help setting it up is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "Looks like hes not_done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada . Load up on your stocks boys because itll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow From NBC President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25 % from 15 % complaining that the nations legislature wasnt living up to a trade deal that was struck last year . Because the Korean Legislature hasnt enacted our Historic Trade Agreement which is their prerogative I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos Lumber Pharma and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS from 15 % to 25 % Trump wrote in a social media post . Trumps announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living . His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties . South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States ranking among the top 10 sources of imports . Nearly $ 150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers . In July Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Koreas president . However the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for . Then in October during Trumps Asia trip he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal which included a promise of investing $ 350 billion in the U.S . Weeks later in November the White House and South Korean government released a fact sheet that was set to put the deal in motion . Edit For anyone interested in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense Ive setup rTrumpTariffTracker . Any help setting it up is appreciated ."

Last week it was the threat of taking Greenland, the market dipped and he quickly walked back any idea of taking Greenland by force and announced a 'framework' for securing the country. Another threat, another market dip, another TACO moment. But something felt different this time. It was almost like it was the last straw. This past weekend, he threatened 100% tariffs on Canada, but by today there was no market reaction to the news. Was it because the threat resolved itself before today, or is it because the market finally knows what we all do: the threats are hollow and short-lived? I guess we'll find out after next weekend's threat.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR There was no_market reaction to Trumps weekend threats . Its been pretty well understood for a while now that Trump will walk back whatever crazy threats he tweets on any random weekend TACO but it still impacts the markets when they reopen . Last week it was the threat of taking Greenland the market dipped and he quickly walked back any idea of taking Greenland by force and announced a framework for securing the country . Another threat another market dip another TACO moment . But something felt different this time . It was almost like it was the last straw . This past weekend he threatened 100 % tariffs on Canada but by today there was no_market reaction to the news . Was it because the threat resolved itself before today or is it because the market finally knows what we all do the threats are hollow and shortlived I guess well find out after next weekends threat ."

      "title": "Unprecedented for BOTH gold and stocks near/at ATH's. Gold could double again - my theory.",
      "selftext": "There's something truly different about gold/metals ATH right now. As many have pointed out, these are safe haven assets. When there is turmoil in the world, when the value of government currencies are uncertain, equities are uncertain, this is where the money flows. Can't make more of it, no government can affect it, can hold, can travel. EDIT Previous highs, like the 70's, functioned in this way. Gold at all time highs. Equities in the cellar, bonds in the cellar. The dollar was weak and losing credibility — that's what drove gold up. Critically, central banks weren't buying gold back then — many were selling or holding, believing the price had gotten too high. The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation. Eventually, Volcker jacked rates to 20%, which crushed inflation, strengthened the dollar, and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back. Gold then entered a 20-year bear market, with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s (most famously, the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999). In the 70's we were in stagflation (high inflation low growth) in the US though, so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation, but inflation remained high and growth was low... so demand for t bills was still weak, high inflation. So the fed made a crazy move - pegged interest to 20%. This killed inflation, and brought strong interest back to the dollar, and gold went into a 20 year decline. They can't do that anymore. The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP. How do we service that debt? We issue more bonds. If those bonds paid 20%, we'd go bankrupt. So back to the beginning, what's special about right now. We have never had this situation. Equities are near all time highs. CAPE, which measures P/E ratio of the market, is over 40 for the second time in history, implying very high valuations. The buffet factor, which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224%, the highest ever. And we know metals are also at ATH's. What is happening? Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates, but in the 90's, Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick. Treasury issues bonds. Fed buys them. They just create the money and give it to the treasury. They collect payments. Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury. US does this the most, but everyone has allowed it because there's no better currency. When COVID hit, the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession. In one month, they bought $1.3T of bonds (April 2020). They agree to buy $120B per month thereafter. In the last five years, the money in the world has increased from $15T >>> $22T. This is unprecedented, and rightfully so, countries' central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if they're just going apeshit printing money. (Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP \"loans\" that were forgiven --->> all that extra money drove up equities, properties, groceries... it's the root of the hyper inflation.) Ok we're almost there. 2022. Russia invades Ukraine. US freezes $300B of Russia's dollars. OH shit the dollar isn't what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they don't like us they can just cancel it. Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy. Instead of buying \\~400 tons of gold per year (about 12% of demand) they started buying 1200 tons - 25% of demand in 2024. Now they are buying 900. They are only buying less because the price is up, they don't care about the price they are buying anyway. Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price. Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are, and industry can't buy less. They are buying less treasury bonds. So the dollar has fallen 15% in the last year. Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar. So why would this stop? US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill. Which means more t bills, and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply. They can't raise interest rates like the 70's. If stagflation hits (low growth, high unemployment AND high inflation) we are fucked. Remember our clever friend Japan? Well they just kept buying their t bills. Then they started buying nikkei stocks too. They hold 226% of their gdp in debt, interest is zero, and the yen is cratering. (One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now, FYI.) Stocks WILL drop - who knows when exactly, but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era, we're at 40+. Oh and another record - $1.3T of those stocks are leveraged. When the drop happens where is the safe haven now? Dollar is no longer safe haven. This is why I think gold, silver, platinum could double again. Side note: as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too. Signs are already there - in October is started behaving a little differently - it's not a high risk asset that should track equities, it's a safety asset. Quantum computing the core risk there IMO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Theres something truly different about goldmetals ATH right now . As many have pointed out these are safe haven assets . When there is turmoil in the world when the value of government currencies are uncertain equities are uncertain this is where the money flows . Cant make more of it no_government can affect it can hold can travel . EDIT Previous highs like the 70s functioned in this way . Gold at all time highs . Equities in the cellar bonds in the cellar . The dollar was weak and losing credibility — thats what drove gold up . Critically central banks werent buying gold back then — many were selling or holding believing the price had gotten too high . The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation . Eventually Volcker jacked rates to 20 % which crushed inflation strengthened the dollar and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back . Gold then entered a 20year bear market with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s most famously the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999 . In the 70s we were in stagflation high inflation low growth in the US though so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation but inflation remained high and growth was low ... so demand for t bills was still weak high inflation . So the fed made a crazy move pegged interest to 20 % . This killed inflation and brought strong interest back to the dollar and gold went into a 20 year decline . They cant do that anymore . The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP . How do we service that debt We issue more bonds . If those bonds paid 20 % wed go bankrupt . So back to the beginning whats special about right now . We have never_had this situation . Equities are near all time highs . CAPE which measures PE ratio of the market is over 40 for the second time in history implying very high valuations . The buffet factor which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224 % the highest ever . And we know metals are also at ATHs . What is happening Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates but in the 90s Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick . Treasury issues bonds . Fed buys them . They just create the money and give it to the treasury . They collect payments . Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury . US does this the most but everyone has allowed it because theres no_better currency . When COVID hit the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession . In one month they bought $ 1.3T of bonds April 2020 . They agree to buy $ 120B per month thereafter . In the last five years the money in the world has increased from $ 15T $ 22T . This is unprecedented and rightfully so countries central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if theyre just going apeshit printing money . Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP loans that were forgiven all that extra money drove up equities properties groceries ... its the root of the hyper inflation . Ok were almost there . 2022 . Russia invades Ukraine . US freezes $ 300B of Russias dollars . OH shit the dollar isnt what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they dont like us they can just cancel it . Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy . Instead of buying 400 tons of gold per year about 12 % of demand they started buying 1200 tons 25 % of demand in 2024 . Now they are buying 900 . They are only buying less because the price is up they dont care about the price they are buying anyway . Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price . Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are and industry cant buy less . They are buying less treasury bonds . So the dollar has fallen 15 % in the last year . Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar . So why would this stop US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill . Which means more t bills and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply . They cant raise interest rates like the 70s . If stagflation hits low growth high unemployment AND high inflation we are fucked . Remember our clever friend Japan Well they just kept buying their t bills . Then they started buying nikkei stocks too . They hold 226 % of their gdp in debt interest is zero and the yen is cratering . One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now FYI . Stocks WILL drop who knows when exactly but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era were at 40 . Oh and another record $ 1.3T of those stocks are leveraged . When the drop happens where is the safe haven now Dollar is no_longer safe haven . This is why I think gold silver platinum could double again . Side note as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too . Signs are already there in October is started behaving a little differently its not_a high risk asset that should track equities its a safety asset . Quantum computing the core risk there IMO ."

      "selftext": "Nike is cutting 775 employees as the company looks to boost its bottom line and accelerate its use of “automation,” CNBC has learned. The layoffs, which are in addition to the 1,000 corporate job cuts the company announced last summer, primarily impact distribution center roles in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the sneaker giant operates large warehouses, people familiar with the matter said. In a statement to CNBC, Nike said the layoffs primarily affect its U.S. distribution operations and are designed to “reduce complexity, improve flexibility, and build a more responsive, resilient, responsible, and efficient operation.” “We’re taking steps to strengthen and streamline our operations so we can move faster, operate with greater discipline, and better serve athletes and consumers,” Nike said in the statement. “We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future.” Source: [",

Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back. I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds.

Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back . I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds . Apologies for the word vomit and a subsequent rant . would appreciate any advice ."

      "selftext": "TLDR: in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photos/videos would be deleted in September 2026. Users were outraged; investors seem to think it will flop. But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise: **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This will address the main complaints from your comments.** I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat+ ($5/mo standard rate)... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat+. This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends. Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data. That’s how I got to 13k+ total friends of friends. “Other Revenue” from the Q3 2025 10-Q was $189M and stated as “majority coming from Snapchat+”. It accounted for 9% of total revenue. According to demandsage (dot) com, Snapchat+ had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report. **477M Daily Active Users -> 3.56% of DAUs were subscribed. At 900M Monthly Users -> 1.88% of MAUs were subscribed** (MAUs may be a more effective metric. See end). **And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue.** **Sources of Error:** * “Total users” from the polling includes inactive accounts. This is why I suspect Snap+/MAUs is a better comparison than DAUs (the Snapchat+ rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample). * Snapchat Platinum ($15/mo) and the cheaper storage option ($2/mo) are both excluded. * Subscription rates (as a percentage of users) could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date (Sep 2026) approaches. * Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly. **Of course, the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base.** **And that’s where the regard army comes in.** Help me take this from 13k to 100k+ datapoints. Regards, I call upon thee! **HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT+** Step 1: Go to your profile and tap on the “Try Snapchat+” button at the top. NOTE: Only appears for users who don’t have Snapchat+. Step 2: Write down the circled number. If it doesn’t appear, restart the app and try again. **HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT:** Step 1: Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2: Search for “How many” and click the first filter. Write down the number above your head. **Please put your stats in the comments!** If you include your age and rough location, I’ll add your data to my dataset. My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat+ users. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH** **EDIT: I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning. Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat+ revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts. This should address the main complaints from your comments.**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photosvideos would be deleted in September 2026 . Users were outraged investors seem to think it will flop . But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This will address the main complaints from your comments . I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat $ 5mo standard rate ... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat . This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends . Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data . That ’ s how I got to 13k total friends of friends . “ Other Revenue ” from the Q3 2025 10Q was $ 189M and stated as “ majority coming from Snapchat ” . It accounted for 9 % of total revenue . According to demandsage dot com Snapchat had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report . 477M Daily Active Users 3.56 % of DAUs were subscribed . At 900M Monthly Users 1.88 % of MAUs were subscribed MAUs may be a more effective metric . See end . And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue . Sources of Error “ Total users ” from the polling includes inactive accounts . This is why I suspect SnapMAUs is a better comparison than DAUs the Snapchat rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample . Snapchat Platinum $ 15mo and the cheaper storage option $ 2mo are both excluded . Subscription rates as a percentage of users could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date Sep 2026 approaches . Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly . Of course the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base . And that ’ s where the regard army comes in . Help me take this from 13k to 100k datapoints . Regards I call upon thee HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT Step 1 Go to your profile and tap on the “ Try Snapchat ” button at the top . NOTE Only appears for users who don ’ t have Snapchat . Step 2 Write down the circled number . If it doesn ’ t appear restart the app and try again . HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT Step 1 Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2 Search for “ How many ” and click the first filter . Write down the number above your head . Please put your stats in the comments If you include your age and rough location I ’ ll add your data to my dataset . My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat users . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH EDIT I was banned from posting and commenting for 2 days after I tried to post this morning . Full data analytics and Q4 Snapchat revenue estimate will drop after the ban lifts . This should address the main complaints from your comments ."

      "selftext": "I am in love with the stock market and I recently came up with (what I think may be) a fun idea: A website/app for ranked trading and investing. Here's the rundown: \\- You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio \\- There will be daily, weekly, monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return. \\-From there it's simple, outperform 90% of other investors in the time period? You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights. Blow 100% of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage? You get a low rank and get shamed by other users. Personally, I think this will be great, it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive. I do have some other ideas as well, however these do stray a little from the core of the idea: \\- Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks \\- Built in news tab \\- A daily quiz about recent news, where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws. \\- Built-in trading companions to win prizes. I'm really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen. If there's any feedback you have please let me know in the comments.",

Heres the rundown You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio There will be daily weekly monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return . From there its simple outperform 90 % of other investors in the time period You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights . Blow 100 % of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage You get a low rank and get shamed by other users . Personally I think this will be great it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive . I do have some other ideas as well however these do stray a little from the core of the idea Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks Built in news tab A daily quiz about recent news where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws . Builtin trading companions to win prizes . Im really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen . If theres any feedback you have please let me know in the comments ."

      "title": "BMBL struggles with revenue decline despite cost cuts and balance sheet improvements",
      "selftext": "Bumble Inc BMBL has been trading near multiyear lows recently, around 3.55 to 3.60 USD, reflecting pressure from declining revenue and changing user metrics. Over the past year, the stock has fallen sharply from previous highs, while management has taken steps to cut costs and improve financial flexibility. For context, Q3 2025 revenue came in at about 246.2 million USD, down roughly 10 percent year over year, with Bumble App revenue declining to 199 million USD per last 10-Q. Earlier quarters showed similar trends, with Q1 2025 revenue around 247 million USD, also down compared to prior periods. Total paying users have decreased slightly, though management is focusing on engagement quality and product updates to stabilize this metric. On the cost side, Bumble reduced its global workforce by approximately 240 positions in early 2025, representing about 30 percent of staff, which management expects to generate roughly 40 million USD in annualized savings. The company also settled a tax receivable obligation at a discount, paying 186 million USD versus a 419 million USD carrying value. This move improves long-term flexibility, although user growth and revenue trends remain headwinds. Leadership changes have also shaped recent strategy. CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd returned in early 2025 to guide the company, and the Chief Product Officer recently departed as part of a reorganization under a single product leader. These moves indicate a focus on streamlining decision-making and product execution. From a trading perspective, BMBL has shown elevated volatility around earnings reports and announcements, with technical support near multiyear lows around 3.50 USD and resistance near prior highs in the 4.50–5.00 USD range. Volume has been uneven, suggesting cautious participation from investors. Long-term considerations include the strength of the Bumble brand in online dating and the potential for engagement and monetization improvements, balanced against revenue declines, reduced paying users, and ongoing competition in the social and dating app market. Execution on product updates and user retention will be critical to any recovery. Not financial advice. This is a neutral summary based on recent filings and public news. Do you think BMBL can stabilize revenue and user metrics with these changes, or is the declining trend likely to continue?",

      "selftext_processed": "Bumble Inc BMBL has been trading near multiyear lows recently around 3.55 to 3.60 USD reflecting pressure from declining revenue and changing user metrics . Over the past year the stock has fallen sharply from previous highs while management has taken steps to cut costs and improve financial flexibility . For context Q3 2025 revenue came in at about 246.2 million USD down roughly 10 percent year over year with Bumble App revenue declining to 199 million USD per last 10Q . Earlier quarters showed similar trends with Q1 2025 revenue around 247 million USD also down compared to prior periods . Total paying users have decreased slightly though management is focusing on engagement quality and product updates to stabilize this metric . On the cost side Bumble reduced its global workforce by approximately 240 positions in early 2025 representing about 30 percent of staff which management expects to generate roughly 40 million USD in annualized savings . The company also settled a tax receivable obligation at a discount paying 186 million USD versus a 419 million USD carrying value . This move improves longterm flexibility although user growth and revenue trends remain headwinds . Leadership changes have also shaped recent strategy . CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd returned in early 2025 to guide the company and the Chief Product Officer recently departed as part of a reorganization under a single product leader . These moves indicate a focus on streamlining decisionmaking and product execution . From a trading perspective BMBL has shown elevated volatility around earnings reports and announcements with technical support near multiyear lows around 3.50 USD and resistance near prior highs in the 4.50–5.00 USD range . Volume has been uneven suggesting cautious participation from investors . Longterm considerations include the strength of the Bumble brand in online dating and the potential for engagement and monetization improvements balanced against revenue declines reduced paying users and ongoing competition in the social and dating app market . Execution on product updates and user retention will be critical to any recovery . Not_financial advice . This is a neutral summary based on recent filings and public news . Do you think BMBL can stabilize revenue and user metrics with these changes or is the declining trend likely to continue"

      "selftext": "If you want to last, **cheat the institutions**. Not by fighting them. By **observing them**. Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $4.4 billion according to Reuters. This purchase follows a 26-ton acquisition in Q3 2025, bringing Tether's total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons. In the same quarter, Tether also acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth about $850 million. We can talk all day about strategies, indicators, setups. But one thing is certain: institutions don’t just set the direction, they almost always **hold the best cards**. They see it first. They position first. And most importantly, they never get attached to a narrative. While many were still debating, **gold printed a new ATH at 5100**. And that didn’t happen by accident. Tether, on its side, positioned itself **at the right time**: 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025. No tweet. No speech. Just action. Now, with the current headlines, I honestly think this is **only the beginning**. Intel stock took its share, dropping -17% in a single day. At that point, it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term, using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries, trading long or short Temporarily. The entire market could react even worse with what’s coming: tariffs, politics, macro, liquidity. And that’s where my real questions begin: **Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter?** **Is this really the right moment to take a position?**",

Booz Allen Hamilton’s stock price dropped by more than 10% on the heels of the Treasury Department’s announcement. > The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations. “President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans’ trust in government,” Bessent said in a statement. “Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,” he said. > The department noted that between 2018 and 2020, Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn “stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.” The data breach affected about 406,000 taxpayers, according to the IRS.",

The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton totaling $ 4.8 million in annual spending and $ 21 million in total obligations . “ President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste fraud and abuse and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans ’ trust in government ” Bessent said in a statement . “ Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service ” he said . The department noted that between 2018 and 2020 Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn “ stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. ” The data breach affected about 406000 taxpayers according to the IRS ."

      "selftext": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU (Nvidia) and the HBM (SK Hynix/Micron), ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer. Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027. The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies. To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called \"T-Glass\"), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply. Taiwas Glass ) spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the \"T-Glass\" recipe. They just approved a $2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn. Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk. Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya). The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news. Nittobo (Japan) didn't stop at a 2x; it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock. As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division (likely Q1/Q2 2026), the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock. \\*\\*TLDR\\*\\* Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027. Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them. I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind. Corp. (1802.TW)",

      "selftext_processed": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU Nvidia and the HBM SK HynixMicron ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer . Entire AI supply chain from Blackwell to Apple ’ s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly . And they are sold out until 2027 . The general assumption is that an H100Blackwell GPU is just silicon but the chip sits on a substrate that green board . If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow the chip cracks and dies . To prevent warping you need Low CTE Glass often called TGlass which is currently manufactured by Nittobo Japan which is currently sold out hence AppleQualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply . Taiwas Glass spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the TGlass recipe . They just approved a $ 2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn . Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ . They need a second source to reduce risk . Also they are the only non Chinese option . US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives and Nittobo is maxed out . Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers Unimicron Nan Ya . The stock is up 200 % over the last year but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news . Nittobo Japan didnt stop at a 2x it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock . As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division likely Q1Q2 2026 the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock . TLDR Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027 . Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them . I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind . Corp. 1802.TW"

      "title": "$NOW (ServiceNow): premium valuation, but elite fundamentals",
      "selftext": "($NOW) and I’m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names. A few fundamentals that stand out to me: • \\~20–21% subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98% • Non-GAAP operating margin above 30% • Strong free cash flow generation (\\~30%+ FCF margin annually) • RPO and cRPO both growing >20% YoY, giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn’t an “AI hype” story. AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows (IT, HR, finance, customer operations) that companies already rely on. These are mission-critical systems with high switching costs, which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts. Valuation is clearly premium, so this isn’t a cheap stock. But the combination of durable growth, margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a long-term compounder than a short-term trade. I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum. Curious how others here see $NOW: • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce? • Any long-term risks I might be underestimating? Not investment advice, just sharing research and looking for different perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ NOW and I ’ m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names . A few fundamentals that stand out to me • 20–21 % subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98 % • NonGAAP operating margin above 30 % • Strong free cash flow generation 30 % FCF margin annually • RPO and cRPO both growing 20 % YoY giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn ’ t an “ AI hype ” story . AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows IT HR finance customer operations that companies already rely on . These are missioncritical systems with high switching costs which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts . Valuation is clearly premium so this isn ’ t a cheap stock . But the combination of durable growth margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a longterm compounder than a shortterm trade . I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum . Curious how others here see $ NOW • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce • Any longterm risks I might be underestimating Not_investment advice just sharing research and looking for different perspectives ."

      "selftext": "Spent a long time hand picking these by going one by one through thinkorswim and looking for solid companies that have bottomed and are showing strong Nikki’s momentum going forward. Each has a great near term opportunity but would also be good long term holds. Options are cheaper here than other popular names from social media and offer a higher near term upside. Good luck out there. Worked hard on this. ACN: Accenture plc Accenture is making strong progress with AI, showing a 10% year-over-year increase in managed services and better operating margins expected in fiscal 2026. The technical indicators also suggest potential for further gains, supported by solid volume and momentum. ADP: Automatic Data Processing ADP is a reliable performer with consistent earnings and dividends, setting up for about 31% total returns in 2026 due to steady growth and an attractive entry point from recent market dips. AJG: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Gallagher continues to grow through acquisitions, with organic expansion and likely earnings beats ahead. Analysts anticipate positive results next week, reinforced by a favorable overall outlook. BIIB: Biogen Inc. Biogen’s pipeline is advancing, including EU approval for a high-dose version of Spinraza, which strengthens the positive outlook. Combined with stable earnings and a recent 9% stock rise, it points to recovery potential. BRO: Brown & Brown, Inc. Brown & Brown maintains steady organic growth, enhanced by a new healthcare platform and a recent dividend increase. These developments should bolster the positive case moving forward. CHDN: Churchill Downs Incorporated Churchill Downs benefits from its strong brand and investments in luxury experiences like Derby suites, along with share buybacks that have reduced outstanding shares by 30% over the past decade. Analysts expect a higher valuation from new track developments. CLX: The Clorox Company Clorox is trading at an attractive 16 times forward earnings, given its over 35% return on invested capital. The lower multiples offer value, and consistent demand for household essentials should drive a recovery. CMG: Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle’s long-term potential remains clear despite economic challenges, with strong operations and a reset in valuation creating an opportunity to buy. The focus is on continued growth beyond temporary issues like reduced customer traffic. CNC: Centene Corporation Centene appears undervalued at current multiples, with stable earnings and the possibility of trading at 14 times 2026 earnings per share. While there are government-related risks, improvements in margins could shift sentiment positively. CPRT: Copart, Inc. Copart holds a leading position in global auctions with over 300,000 buyers ensuring strong liquidity advantages, high margins, and sustainable growth. Its careful cash management supports a solid positive outlook. DECK: Deckers Outdoor Corporation Deckers could see sales growth if lower interest rates encourage consumer spending in 2026. Even with cautious guidance, the brand’s resilience and undervaluation suggest significant potential upside. FDS: FactSet Research Systems FactSet’s first-quarter margins and a win with Barclays highlight improving profitability, while momentum indicators point to long-term gains. Ongoing revenue and earnings growth maintain the positive perspective. IT: Gartner, Inc. Gartner’s leading market position and recurring revenue provide stability, despite some AI-related concerns. The expectation is for accelerated growth through its advisory strengths after any short-term setbacks. LIN: Linde plc Linde has a backlog of $7 to $10 billion in long-term contracts, supporting over 10% earnings per share growth. Analysts remain positive about its consistent expansion and long-term compounding ability. MCK: McKesson Corporation McKesson seems undervalued by about 41% based on discounted cash flow analysis, with ongoing benefits from GLP-1 trends into 2026. Its strong performance over recent years indicates room for further progress. MOH: Molina Healthcare, Inc. Molina shows strength in its Marketplace segment, and recent investments like those from Michael Burry add to the appeal. Growth through premiums and acquisitions supports a positive view in the healthcare sector. MRSH: Marsh & McLennan Companies Marsh & McLennan is projected for 8.6% earnings per share growth and rising revenues, positioning it as a consistent performer. Analysts view any adjustments as temporary, with sustained gains expected. MSI: Motorola Solutions, Inc. Motorola Solutions is seeing growth in tactical communications, along with analyst upgrades. Even at normalized valuations, there appears to be potential for additional increases in this key area. NFLX: Netflix, Inc. Netflix demonstrates solid margins and fourth-quarter results that affirm its growth path. Analysts expect continued subscriber additions and AI initiatives to maintain its premium status. NOW: ServiceNow, Inc. ServiceNow’s AI efforts could generate over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2026, attracting hedge funds and positive analyst views. Despite a 28% decline, the setup suggests a possible rebound. ORLY: O’Reilly Automotive O’Reilly benefits from steady demand and substantial share buybacks, paving the way for earnings growth in 2026. Analysts are optimistic, with trends indicating continued progress. PANW: Palo Alto Networks Palo Alto Networks is approaching a positive trendline that could lead to gains in 2026, supported by buy ratings from analysts. Demand for AI and cybersecurity keeps its competitive advantages strong. PAYX: Paychex, Inc. Paychex looks undervalued with expected revenue growth ahead. A partnership with PayPal enhances sentiment, targeting potential upside to $133 based on its recurring business model. PSN: Parsons Corporation Parsons is shifting toward defense and securing contracts like New Murabba, with U.S.-Qatar agreements adding support. Commercial successes and momentum reinforce the positive outlook. REGN: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron’s recovery is building with contributions from Dupixent and Libtayo, plus upcoming pipeline developments in 2026. Earnings surprises and undervaluation make it an appealing choice. RSG: Republic Services, Inc. Republic Services has a track record of earnings surprises and a strong competitive position for potential beats. Its multi-year performance suggests attractive entry points for long-term investors. STLA: Stellantis N.V. Stellantis has been upgraded to overweight, with leadership changes and $13 billion in U.S. investments aimed at sales recovery by 2026. The current dip presents value opportunities. STZ: Constellation Brands Constellation’s beer business is performing well, with margins recovering after one-time issues. Analysts see current fluctuations as chances to invest for growth in 2026. TEAM: Atlassian Corporation Atlassian’s AI capabilities and over 19% revenue growth outperform peers, with effective execution opening up further potential. Its collaboration tools are expected to lead the market. TRI: Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters targets 7.5 to 8% organic growth in 2026, accelerated by AI and acquisitions. The buy rating reflects confidence in its ongoing profitability. TROX: Tronox Holdings plc Tronox has risen 47%, with analysts raising targets to $6, indicating optimism. While growth may be moderate, the pricing supports potential for gains. UNH: UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth could return to all-time highs in 2026 through adjustments in care ratios, with undervaluation suggesting upside to over $400 per share in positive scenarios. VRSK: Verisk Analytics, Inc. Verisk’s core strengths outweigh short-term concerns, with growth and high margins driving buy recommendations. Long-term profitability appears secure despite recent dips. WIX: Wix.com Ltd. Wix’s AI-powered website builder and partnerships are driving growth, with its under $5 billion valuation offering asymmetric opportunities. The potential for expansion looks promising .",

      "selftext": "I landed an analyst role at a small but ambitious firm. What I’ve seen there has honestly confused me. I’m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn’t hold up in the real world. This firm isn’t focused on the usual private equity, venture capital, or hedge fund activities. They’re not betting on growth stories, turnarounds, or “great management teams.” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea: Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own. Not “undervalued future potential.” Not “great product, bad quarter.” It’s literally cash, securities, or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company’s market cap. The types of companies they look at are usually: \\- Cash-burning \\- Strategically dead or stuck in R&D limbo \\- Unloved by the market But still public, regulated, and liquid. Instead of trying to fix these businesses, the idea is much colder: Buy control or influence, shut down what doesn’t work, liquidate or distribute assets, and turn that “trapped” public-market capital into cash. So far, that part at least makes sense to me. Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next. They don’t just liquidate, return cash, and move on. The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that: \\- Recycles that capital repeatedly \\- Tries to use equity more than debt \\- Focuses on growing NAV per share, not revenue or EPS optics \\- Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin (which I know is controversial) The internal framing is basically: “We’re arbitraging public-market mispricing, not running operating companies.” No hero CEOs. No turnaround fantasies. No “this biotech pipeline will work eventually.” Just: buy assets cheaper than they’re worth, realize value, redeploy, repeat. Apparently, there’s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing, liquidations happening, and capital being returned. What’s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale, especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure. On one hand, the logic feels clean. It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn’t rely on market optimism just arithmetic. On the other hand, public markets are messy: Boards resist. Shareholder votes take time. Regulators interfere. Discounts don’t always close. Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside. Once you start recycling instead of returning capital, timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more. So I’m not posting this to promote anything. I’m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks. For people who’ve seen similar strategies up close: Does public-market NAV arbitrage actually scale as a long-term strategy? Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks? Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time, politics, and dead capital? I’d really appreciate blunt feedback. If this is naive, I’d prefer to learn that now.",

I ’ m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn ’ t hold up in the real world . This firm isn ’ t focused on the usual private equity venture capital or hedge fund activities . They ’ re not_betting on growth stories turnarounds or “ great management teams. ” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own . Not_ “ undervalued future potential. ” Not_ “ great product bad quarter. ” It ’ s literally cash securities or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company ’ s market cap . The types of companies they look at are usually Cashburning Strategically dead or stuck in RD limbo Unloved by the market But still public regulated and liquid . Instead of trying to fix these businesses the idea is much colder Buy control or influence shut down what doesn ’ t work liquidate or distribute assets and turn that “ trapped ” publicmarket capital into cash . So far that part at least makes sense to me . Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next . They don ’ t just liquidate return cash and move on . The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that Recycles that capital repeatedly Tries to use equity more than debt Focuses on growing NAV per share not_revenue or EPS optics Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin which I know is controversial The internal framing is basically “ We ’ re arbitraging publicmarket mispricing not_running operating companies. ” No_hero CEOs . No_turnaround fantasies . No_ “ this biotech pipeline will work eventually. ” Just buy assets cheaper than they ’ re worth realize value redeploy repeat . Apparently there ’ s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing liquidations happening and capital being returned . What ’ s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure . On one hand the logic feels clean . It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn ’ t rely on market optimism just arithmetic . On the other hand public markets are messy Boards resist . Shareholder votes take time . Regulators interfere . Discounts don ’ t always close . Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside . Once you start recycling instead of returning capital timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more . So I ’ m not_posting this to promote anything . I ’ m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks . For people who ’ ve seen similar strategies up close Does publicmarket NAV arbitrage actually scale as a longterm strategy Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time politics and dead capital I ’ d really appreciate blunt feedback . If this is naive I ’ d prefer to learn that now ."

      "selftext": "Clorox just spent $2.25B to acquire Purell maker GOJO Industries. The deal increases CLXs exposure to the health and wellness category (durable brand economics and high trust sensitivity) with GOJO being an 80% B2B player, complimenting CLXs 80% retail focus. Reasonable valuation with room for synergies: procurement scale benefits, overhead reduction, expanding Purells retail presence. What do you guys think of the deal? Net Positive or Net Negative for the stock at \\~$113? I personally think it’s a strong net positive for brand durability. Clorox’s portfolio is now filled with earned monopolies ( business having #1 or #2 market share position in stable categories)",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of CoreWeave popped 8% in premarket trading on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider. >Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $87.20 per share, according to a release. The share price is a discount from Friday’s closing price of $92.98. >“CoreWeave’s deep AI factory expertise, platform software, and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. “Together, we’re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution.” >Nvidia’s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030,” the companies said. >A gigawatt is a measure of power that’s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity. Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households, according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration. >CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia’s graphics processing units, which are key for training models and running large AI workloads. The company, which some investors have classified as a “neocloud,” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners. >Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer. >In September, CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “residual unsold capacity through April 2032, according to the agreement. >CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March, and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity, including from Nvidia. >As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure, CoreWeave has been on a deal-making blitz. The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure, just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $22.4 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of CoreWeave popped 8 % in premarket trading on Monday after Nvidia announced it has invested $ 2 billion in the artificial intelligence infrastructure provider . Nvidia purchased CoreWeave Class A common stock at $ 87.20 per share according to a release . The share price is a discount from Friday ’ s closing price of $ 92.98 . “ CoreWeave ’ s deep AI factory expertise platform software and unmatched execution velocity are recognized across the industry ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ Together we ’ re racing to meet extraordinary demand for NVIDIA AI factories—the foundation of the AI industrial revolution. ” Nvidia ’ s investment will help CoreWeave accelerate its buildout of “ 5 gigawatts of AI factories by 2030 ” the companies said . A gigawatt is a measure of power that ’ s becoming an increasingly common metric for describing AI data center capacity . Five gigawatts is roughly equivalent to the annual power consumption of 4 million U.S. households according to a CNBC analysis of data from the Energy Information Administration . CoreWeave primarily generates revenue by building and renting out data centers that are full of Nvidia ’ s graphics processing units which are key for training models and running large AI workloads . The company which some investors have classified as a “ neocloud ” has become a crucial player in an increasingly interconnected web of AI infrastructure partners . Nvidia is already a major CoreWeave backer . In September CoreWeave disclosed an order worth at least $ 6.3 billion from Nvidia in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission . Nvidia has an obligation to buy the “ residual unsold capacity through April 2032 according to the agreement . CoreWeave went public on the Nasdaq in March and the company raised billions of dollars in debt and equity including from Nvidia . As AI startups race to build out their computing infrastructure CoreWeave has been on a dealmaking blitz . The company announced in September that it agreed to provide Meta with $ 14.2 billion of AI cloud infrastructure just days after expanding its contract with OpenAI to $ 22.4 billion ."

      "selftext": "You might ask yourselves, with all the selling happening in the markets, why does Gold continue to go up? It seems like right now, Gold and other precious metals are acting as safe haven investments amidst the economic chaos, On top of that, the narrative of countries buying Gold as reserves instead of dollars is putting extra pressure on the dollar. At some point, a weakening dollar tends to push people into risk assets, If wealthy investors continue buying Gold heavily, it could signal a shift in sentiment, Could this pattern spill over into crypto pumping too, taking profits, and pumping again? Gold already gained over 50% in 2025, and 2026 hasn’t slowed it down, Could the current environment actually be setting up a favorable stage for crypto to rally next? What do you all think, are we about to see a similar safe-to-risk rotation into crypto?",

But then I decided to search for ETFs in that industry and sure enough, the stock is there as part of the holdings, but usually very low, around 3% So I asked myself, what is the ETF that has the most of this company?

      "selftext": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit. This past week, we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro, Swiss franc, and British pound. Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven, in part, by another factor. That is, on Friday, the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check. Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S. It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards, which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar. I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York. For those of you who do not dabble in currencies, rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies. Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth. Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finance's unprecedented rate increases this year, the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies. Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen. Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting. He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar. Due to these factors, we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not respond promptly, then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yen-dollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts, then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen. Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one. Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies. Rate increases would likely have the longest-lasting impact on depressing the dollar. Yen-denominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollar-based treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns. This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen. Alternatively, a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar. This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later, though. This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and pre-market hours on Monday. My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar, which is commodities. In particular, I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar, caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies, will act as a short-term and medium-term backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold. If anything, it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners. That, in turn, could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities. My plan is to continue to hold approximately $6.61M in UGL (90000 shares) and $2.08M in GDXU (4500 shares) for a bit longer than I had planned. I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch. I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill. I most recently re-entered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago. I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their non-leveraged versions and various, non-leveraged equities once I hit certain targets. Also, since I will likely get asked about this, I prefer to hold leveraged ETF/ETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative. Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during pre-market hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming. This has been useful several times. In December, I was able to dodge a 10% overall decline in UGL and a 25% decline on GDXU, which was spurred by CME's margin capital increase, by selling right at pre-market open. My draw down was only in the 2-4% range for both positions. Similarly, in October, I was able to walk away with only a 3-6% decline in both positions versus an approximately 10-15% total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open.",

      "selftext_processed": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit . This past week we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro Swiss franc and British pound . Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven in part by another factor . That is on Friday the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check . Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S . It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar . I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York . For those of you who do not_dabble in currencies rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies . Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth . Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finances unprecedented rate increases this year the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies . Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen . Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak . U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting . He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar . Due to these factors we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not_respond promptly then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yendollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen . Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one . Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies . Rate increases would likely have the longestlasting impact on depressing the dollar . Yendenominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollarbased treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns . This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen . Alternatively a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar . This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later though . This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no_actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and premarket hours on Monday . My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar which is commodities . In particular I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies will act as a shortterm and mediumterm backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold . If anything it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners . That in turn could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities . My plan is to continue to hold approximately $ 6.61M in UGL 90000 shares and $ 2.08M in GDXU 4500 shares for a bit longer than I had planned . I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch . I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill . I most recently reentered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago . I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their nonleveraged versions and various nonleveraged equities once I hit certain targets . Also since I will likely get asked about this I prefer to hold leveraged ETFETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative . Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during premarket hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming . This has been useful several times . In December I was able to dodge a 10 % overall decline in UGL and a 25 % decline on GDXU which was spurred by CMEs margin capital increase by selling right at premarket open . My draw down was only in the 24 % range for both positions . Similarly in October I was able to walk away with only a 36 % decline in both positions versus an approximately 1015 % total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open ."

My calls are up 1000 % now and stock up 250 % . Ive read that after 2026 growth could slow down . And this stock will tank hard for sure .

There have been too many good trades that I missed due to not having access to international market.

I have tried US ADR but these are very limited and don't cover a lot of promising stocks.

His reasoning behind these picks as follows: * These sectors have underperformed the broader market over the last five years. For context, as of early 2026, the S&P 500 gained approximately 87% since 2022, while the energy sector (XLE) returned only about 24% in that same period. * In the last 75-years, when a sector reaches this specific level of underperformance, it typically marks a major turning point. * Geopolitical risks favors both groups What are your top bets on these sectors?",

His reasoning behind these picks as follows These sectors have underperformed the broader market over the last five years . For context as of early 2026 the SP 500 gained approximately 87 % since 2022 while the energy sector XLE returned only about 24 % in that same period . In the last 75years when a sector reaches this specific level of underperformance it typically marks a major turning point .

      "selftext": "My position details: I own 1,982 shares of Impinj (PI) stock. PI market cap: $4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF (RAIN) RFID tag integrated circuits (ICs). They sell more than about 15 billion per year. Impinj might sell a tag IC for $0.005-$0.02. Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others. Inlay manufacturers sell inlays (tag IC + antenna + substrate) to end customers to attach to their products. Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers. Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP. RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily. Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now. Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers. Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new \"Protected Mode\". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea. There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use: \"It \\[Gen2x\\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \\[...\\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.\" \"Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.\" \"Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.\" \"Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.\" I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands will, like Walmart or Nike), but Impinj uniquely will be involved in \\*every tag scan for authentication\\*. Impinj will not make ad revenue on item data itself - only end-users like Nike or Kroger would. However, Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchases/returns. Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service. Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones. Qualcomm Q-6690 - UHF (RAIN) RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time. Commercial/industrial device focus only. It's a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHF/RAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC. That will unlock tons more potential. Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature. I see this playing out like so: 1. Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger (or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever) 2. For the first time, companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there. 3. Companies know what food is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 4. Companies know what clothing is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 5. Fundamentally, Companies know identifying information of any UHF (RAIN) RFID tagged item in anyone's house (if the tag IC is alive and enabled), as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from. 6. Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information. Impinj won't make money off this directly, but this'll push more tags to be in more things. 7. Companies will want to tag fucking everything, so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion. I'd say >20x growth potential, reasonably, not including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me. Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth (which everyone already has) but I don't see it. Inlays are 2-5x as expensive, read rate is 100x to >1000x slower, tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a reader/interrogator, tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere. I'd forget about it. I think Impinj needs to hit +20% yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and today's valuation. Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $200+/share. Consumer market is the moonshot / gamble for long term holders. Authentication, to me, is a positive thing of unknown magnitude/effect, though it'd definitely improve margins. Risks: \\-Trump's continued antagonizing of Europe (and the world) may harm/kill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize and/or may create preference for NXP within the EU. Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID. \\-Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to S&P smallcap 600. Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retail/holiday cycle. Many sudden ups/downs based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the company's growth as a result. Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in. \\-The timeline to break into the consumer space, if it ever does, may still be long. Obstacles: \\-Tagging metal surfaces (like canned goods or foil-lined bags) can be done and the physics has been solved, but crucially it remains expensive at >$0.60 per tag. A normal RAIN RFID tag (tag IC + inlay) might be $0.035-$0.05. A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news. Until then, this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology. \\-Breaking into consumer (normal person) smartphones for the high growth trajectory. Impinj is making all the right moves so far, but it's a barrier that hasn't been broken yet. Bulls: \\-If you hear about major new enterprise customers, that's bullish. Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon. \\-If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service, that's bullish. \\-If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough, that's very bullish. \\-If the EU \\*mandates\\* RAIN RFID for DPP, that's very bullish (whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option, that's somewhat bullish). \\-If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF (RAIN) RFID capability built into consumer phones, that's extremely bullish. Bears: \\-If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts, that's bearish. \\-If Impinj's only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share (like vs NXP) rather than new market growth, that's very bearish. Recommendation: Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below \\~$110. Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $70 (like last April) because I'd peg Impinj at roughly $50-$60 without its growth premium at all. Sit on it for 3 years and then re-evaluate.",

They sell more than about 15 billion per year . Impinj might sell a tag IC for $ 0.005 $ 0.02 . Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others . Inlay manufacturers sell inlays tag IC antenna substrate to end customers to attach to their products . Tags can be little stickers adhered to paper clothing tags sewed nearly invisibly into clothing hidden inside anything nonmetallic or nonliquid etc . Impinj also manufactures expensive standalone RFID readers but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers . I dont have much to say about their readers . Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICschips . Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly . Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10year agreement to not_sue over patents which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034 . David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches . For the next 8 years Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP . RAIN RFID is currently used in places like Walmart Inditex clothing UPS package tracking packageonrighttruck verification Delta and United baggage tracking medicine tracking car tires and other parts etc . Supply chains and clothing primarily . Recent investor calls show theyre starting to push food with Kroger . Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets which may explain their current valuation which is arguably high . Theyre starting in the bakery sections now . Engineering deets you can skip if youre not_technical Tag ICs have been improving in performance usually about 12dB RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity per generation node shrink . This has been essential to the technologys capability and expanded usage . I asked Gemini about next node and its guessing 20something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not_get smaller . Impinj knows this . Digital performancecapabilityfeatureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes . Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology . Also smaller node more tag ICs per wafer cheaper tag ICs so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead . 20something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not_have a premium . Impinj requires cheap wafers . Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls do your own reading on this . I know Trump is fucking over USEU relations and is causing EU reevaluation of large initiatives and regulations so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all even as a optionbackup . HOWEVER Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame retail consumers . Right now RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout . The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase . Consumer use is the reason for Impinjs new Protected Mode . Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN . Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone or Kroger could set PINs for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries tags at home for pantry inventory etc . You get the idea . Theres also insights into Impinjs thoughts from press releases on Gen2x which extends the protocol the tag ICs use It Gen2x addresses consumer privacy at pointofsale .. ... We are today focused on enterprise use cases but tomorrow ’ s emphasis will be on consumer use cases including consumer safety and item sustainability . Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting fraudulent returns or both . Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers . When necessary the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN . Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product ’ s authenticity using a challengeresponse protocol preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain . I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic . Impinj must control that . I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself this is a Nike Air shoe number 123456 for example but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication Impinj indeed made this tag IC it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database . So Impinj wont know what the product is only the brands will like Walmart or Nike but Impinj uniquely will be involved in every tag scan for authentication . Impinj will not_make ad revenue on item data itself only endusers like Nike or Kroger would . However Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchasesreturns . Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service . Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones . Qualcomm Q6690 UHF RAIN RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time . Commercialindustrial device focus only . Its a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHFRAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC . That will unlock tons more potential . Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature . I see this playing out like so 1 . Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever 2 . For the first time companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there . 3 . Companies know what food is in someones house and how long its been there . 4 . Companies know what clothing is in someones house and how long its been there . 5 . Fundamentally Companies know identifying information of any UHF RAIN RFID tagged item in anyones house if the tag IC is alive and enabled as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from . 6 . Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information . Impinj wont make money off this directly but thisll push more tags to be in more things . 7 . Companies will want to tag fucking everything so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion . Id say 20x growth potential reasonably not_including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me . Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth which everyone already has but I dont see it . Inlays are 25x as expensive read rate is 100x to 1000x slower tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a readerinterrogator tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere . Id forget about it . I think Impinj needs to hit 20 % yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and todays valuation . Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $ 200share . Consumer market is the moonshot gamble for long term holders . Authentication to me is a positive thing of unknown magnitudeeffect though itd definitely improve margins . Risks Trumps continued antagonizing of Europe and the world may harmkill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize andor may create preference for NXP within the EU . Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID . Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to SP smallcap 600 . Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retailholiday cycle . Many sudden upsdowns based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the companys growth as a result . Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in . The timeline to break into the consumer space if it ever does may still be long . Obstacles Tagging metal surfaces like canned goods or foillined bags can be done and the physics has been solved but crucially it remains expensive at $ 0.60 per tag . A normal RAIN RFID tag tag IC inlay might be $ 0.035 $ 0.05 . A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news . Until then this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology . Breaking into consumer normal person smartphones for the high growth trajectory . Impinj is making all the right moves so far but its a barrier that hasnt been broken yet . Bulls If you hear about major new enterprise customers thats bullish . Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon . If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service thats bullish . If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough thats very bullish . If the EU mandates RAIN RFID for DPP thats very bullish whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option thats somewhat bullish . If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF RAIN RFID capability built into consumer phones thats extremely bullish . Bears If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts thats bearish . If Impinjs only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share like vs NXP rather than new market growth thats very bearish . Recommendation Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below $ 110 . Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $ 70 like last April because Id peg Impinj at roughly $ 50 $ 60 without its growth premium at all . Sit on it for 3 years and then reevaluate ."

He's literally converted all his savings into metals, metal companies, leveraging options as gold rises as of late. I'm not much of one for apocalyptic collapse theories. I tend to believe reality ends up being between the extremes. I'm wondering what the thoughts are here on such extreme theories and applying them so drastically to investment strategies.",

So Tesla regardless of being valued at 50-60 billion dollars back until 2018 wasn't part of SP500 since it hadn't posted 4 quarters of profits. Ocassional quarter profits, but no consequetive profits. That changed in 2019, when the company posted 4 consequetive years worth of profit. After successful profit years, even if minimal, Money Managers at Wall Street took a note and started aggressively buying to push the stock up. So much so, that even before the inclusion of stock in index, it was at 400 billion dollars worth of market cap. And passive indexes were forced to buy in the stock at rebalancing. Hence locking the value. I don't have data to back the initial rally between end of 4th quarter profit and date of sp500 inclusion. And this where I'm guessing. Perhaps y'all could correct me or show some data if that's actually true.",

Q3 was weak, indicates flat to maybe revenue being up above 2025 with chinas segment declining dramatically. Built a model with reasonable growth rates, operating margins trends, wacc and perp growth rates. My number came to $743, comparing to $1384 which it’s currently trading, it’s around 45% overvalued. I suspect weaker guidance in q4 and with so much growth priced in atm and elevated P/S - P/E ratios, any miss or even in line numbers can send this stock down easily 5-10%. I’ll love to know what you guys think, please prove me wrong or bring up anything I’m missing thanks. My POTENTIAL trade for reference is a long put 33 a contract exp 6 of Feb strike at 1320. Break even is roughly 1287.",

      "selftext": "I have the 4/17 $4 calls and shares Talkspace Inc. (NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

      "selftext": "Hello there, I’m sure many are aware of a memory super-cycle taking place. What I’m not seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet. I know there has been a lot of fear, and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks. However, most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028. I’m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side. The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4. Sandisk, Western Digital, and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory. They are worth taking the time for DD. However, I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far. Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE. You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand, crucial. They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY, they have two in their home state of Idaho, One in Virginia. They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan. Basically, they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI. The thing is, all of this won’t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest. So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble. I’ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback, we’ve already opened Pandora’s box. If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics & believers. Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it’s not going anywhere. People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI, but guess what? Your aunties and cousins all love AI. No matter what they slop is they still consume. That’s just on the reels side of things. When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races. The reason I’m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027. This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030’s. For the consumers sake, I hope not. But it’s a realistic scenario we face. Back to Micron. There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price. The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation. “Although it just hit new all time highs of $399, Micron trades at a forward P/E of roughly 10–12. This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA (24x) or AMD (35x). This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028. That would make today’s mark look like a steep discount. I see them having steady growth through the entire year. As for price action, they’ve been steady as well. Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery. Just want you all to be aware, I’m holding about 140 MU & 130 WDC. So I’m very bullish on memory. However for MU I didn’t enter until the 330 range. Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month. So if an insider is that bullish, I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them. What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle?",

This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028.

      "selftext_processed": "Hello there I ’ m sure many are aware of a memory supercycle taking place . What I ’ m not_seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet . I know there has been a lot of fear and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks . However most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028 . I ’ m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory HBM since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side . The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron Samsung and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4 . Sandisk Western Digital and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory . They are worth taking the time for DD . However I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far . Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE . You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand crucial . They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY they have two in their home state of Idaho One in Virginia . They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan . Basically they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI . The thing is all of this won ’ t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest . So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble . I ’ ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback we ’ ve already opened Pandora ’ s box . If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics believers . Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it ’ s not_going anywhere . People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI but guess what Your aunties and cousins all love AI . No_matter what they slop is they still consume . That ’ s just on the reels side of things . When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races . The reason I ’ m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027 . This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030 ’ s . For the consumers sake I hope not_But it ’ s a realistic scenario we face . Back to Micron . There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year . There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price . The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation . “ Although it just hit new all time highs of $ 399 Micron trades at a forward PE of roughly 10–12 . This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA 24x or AMD 35x . This momentum is expected to accelerate with analysts projecting fullyear fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $ 75.6 billion a 102 % increase over 2025. ” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028 . That would make today ’ s mark look like a steep discount . I see them having steady growth through the entire year . As for price action they ’ ve been steady as well . Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery . Just want you all to be aware I ’ m holding about 140 MU 130 WDC . So I ’ m very bullish on memory . However for MU I didn ’ t enter until the 330 range . Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month . So if an insider is that bullish I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them . What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle"

      "selftext": "The Trump administration is planning to inject $1.6bn into an American rare earths company, its biggest investment in the sector, in Washington’s latest foray into private industry to shore up supplies of key minerals. The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth, a publicly traded Oklahoma-based miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths, according to people familiar with the matter. The government investment and a separate $1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m, both at a price of $17.17. The government agreed to pay $277mn for the equity, giving it an implied gain of $490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $24.77. USA Rare Earth will also receive $1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government. The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company. Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “framework” for a deal that could include access to Greenland’s untapped critical mineral wealth. One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland. USA Rare Earth declined to comment. The commerce department declined to discuss the deal. But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security”. USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons, to raise more than $1bn in fresh equity financing, the people said. It is not directly related to the deal with the government. The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security, including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a so-called golden-share agreement in US Steel. USA Rare Earth, which has a market value of $3.7bn, is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones, missiles and fighter jets. It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Last year, the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies, including MP Materials, Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas. Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration. The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements, a rare earths start-up three months after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr’s venture capital group invested in the company. The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production. A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $500mn from investors. It is on track to raise more than $1bn because of high demand for the financing deal, which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity, often called a “Pipe”. Cantor’s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick, one of Trump’s most prominent cabinet members, has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president’s “America first” agenda. Cantor did not play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth. Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, helped by a 40 per cent jump this week. The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Trump administration is planning to inject $ 1.6bn into an American rare earths company its biggest investment in the sector in Washington ’ s latest foray into private industry to shore up supplies of key minerals . The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth a publicly traded Oklahomabased miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths according to people familiar with the matter . The government investment and a separate $ 1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday according to people familiar with the situation . One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m both at a price of $ 17.17 . The government agreed to pay $ 277mn for the equity giving it an implied gain of $ 490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $ 24.77 . USA Rare Earth will also receive $ 1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government . The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 . A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company . Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “ framework ” for a deal that could include access to Greenland ’ s untapped critical mineral wealth . One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland . USA Rare Earth declined to comment . The commerce department declined to discuss the deal . But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “ focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security ” . USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons to raise more than $ 1bn in fresh equity financing the people said . It is not_directly related to the deal with the government . The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration ’ s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a socalled goldenshare agreement in US Steel . USA Rare Earth which has a market value of $ 3.7bn is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones missiles and fighter jets . It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater Oklahoma . Last year the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies including MP Materials Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas . Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration . The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements a rare earths startup three months after the president ’ s son Donald Trump Jr ’ s venture capital group invested in the company . The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production . A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $ 500mn from investors . It is on track to raise more than $ 1bn because of high demand for the financing deal which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity often called a “ Pipe ” . Cantor ’ s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick one of Trump ’ s most prominent cabinet members has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president ’ s “ America first ” agenda . Cantor did not_play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth . Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year helped by a 40 per cent jump this week . The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year ."

      "selftext": "**Full Disclosure:** I am a landman and have worked with Permian Resources on a contract basis in the past. While this has allowed me to peek under the hood, nothing contained below is privileged information. I just like the stock, the rock, and the management. Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware E&P pack through superior execution and a shareholder-friendly capital return framework. With the Q3’25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance, PR offers a compelling mix of income (**\\~4.8% yield**) and growth at a discount. Crucially, their recent reorganization (moving to a standard C-Corp) has made this the “grown-up” energy hold for my IRA, removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away. **1. The \"Why Now\": Corporate Clean-Up** On Jan 7, 2026, PR completed a major reorganization. Management and long-term holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares. * **The Signal:** Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders (\"eating their own cooking\"). * **The Catalyst:** This removes the \"governance discount.\" Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex Up-C structures. By simplifying, PR widens its buyer pool significantly. **2. Operations: The \"Ground Game\" Advantage** This is where my background matters. While the majors hunt \"elephants\" (massive corporate buyouts), PR is playing a lethal \"ground game.\" * **Q3 Stats:** They closed **\\~250 small transactions** ($180M) in a single quarter. * **Why it works:** They are picking up $100 bills on the sidewalk—singles and doubles that add inventory efficiently without paying the massive M&A premiums seen in headline deals. * **The Numbers:** Production is up to **\\~410 Mboe/d**, Leverage is a boringly safe **0.8x**, and FCF hit a record **\\~$469M**. **3. The 2026 Setup** * **Inventory:** Street consensus sees 2026 FCF potentially exceeding 2025 levels ($1B+ potential) as capital efficiency improves. * **Analyst Action:** Morgan Stanley recently adjusted their PT to $18. With the stock trading \\~ $14.78, that implies **\\~22% upside** just to the target. * **Cash Return:** You get paid to wait. The base dividend is $0.15/quarter (\\~4.1% yield on cost), plus a $1B buyback authorization sitting in the chamber. **4. Risks (The \"Landman\" Reality Check)** No well is a guarantee. Here is what I am watching: * **Waha Gas Pricing:** Delaware Basin gas differentials can be nasty. If takeaway capacity gets tight, realized pricing drops. * **Service Costs:** If 2026 drilling activity heats up, rig rates and frac crews get expensive, squeezing margins. * **Oil Beta:** Obviously, if WTI crashes to $50, the thesis pauses. **My Position** * **Long:** 1,200 shares @ $12.46 Cost Basis. * **Plan:** Accumulating on dips. * **Next Event:** Q4 Earnings & 2026 Guidance on **Feb 25, 2026**. None of this is financial advice and please do your own due diligence. That’s all for now. Will update after earnings. Good luck and keep it turning to the right!",

While this has allowed me to peek under the hood nothing_contained below is privileged information . I just like the stock the rock and the management . Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware EP pack through superior execution and a shareholderfriendly capital return framework . With the Q3 ’ 25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance PR offers a compelling mix of income 4.8 % yield and growth at a discount . Crucially their recent reorganization moving to a standard CCorp has made this the “ grownup ” energy hold for my IRA removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away . 1 . The Why Now Corporate CleanUp On Jan 7 2026 PR completed a major reorganization . Management and longterm holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares . The Signal Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders eating their own cooking . The Catalyst This removes the governance discount . Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex UpC structures . By simplifying PR widens its buyer pool significantly . 2 .

      "title": "Google is about to replace Nvidia as the world's #1 value company",
      "selftext": "The path to #1 is shorter than anyone realizes. Nvidia is sitting at roughly $4.62 Trillion while Google is at $3.99 Trillion. The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers. Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up. Once **across $380.50, the \"Google is King\" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. **The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance** Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market. **They are cloud leaders** Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand. Q3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**). Annualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion. Operating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability. Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.** **They are entertainment leaders** Youtube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services) According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like. **Google has it's own silicon** Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the \"Nvidia Tax\" that crushes other tech companies margins. Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced. **Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced** Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow. Look at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.** If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly. **Wall Street is quietly loading up** Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings. **The non digital assets** Pixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. **TLDR** Google is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company. **On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.** \\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all. Next earnings: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday, February 4, at 1:30pm Pacific Time (4:30pm Eastern Time).

      "selftext_processed": "The path to 1 is shorter than anyone realizes . Nvidia is sitting at roughly $ 4.62 Trillion while Google is at $ 3.99 Trillion . The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $ 380.50 . That is just a 15.8 % move from the current price of roughly $ 328 based on the close numbers . Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot It wasnt just a number it was a psychological trigger . The moment they hit 1 every news outlet ran the headline ETFs rebalanced and retail chased the winner . Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up . Once across $ 380.50 the Google is King headlines start and the momentum buying kicks in . The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri . Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured . They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices . Google now owns the AI layer on 100 % of the mobile distribution channel . No_other competitor exists at this scale . They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market . They are cloud leaders Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft . We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand . Q3 2025 Revenue $ 15.15 billion up 34 % yearoveryear . Annualized Run Rate The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $ 61 billion . Operating Income A record $ 3.59 billion for the third quarter representing a 23.7 % operating margin indicating rapidly increasing profitability . Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a $ 155 billion backlog . They are entertainment leaders Youtube surpassed Netflix and all other streaming services According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report YouTube captured 13.4 % of total TV time Netflix at 8.8 % . Also Netflix 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when its over like now with stranger things while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never_ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like . Google has its own silicon Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade meaning they dont pay the Nvidia Tax that crushes other tech companies margins . Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers . Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear . They instantly become a potential toptier AI chip supplier with massive margins they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV . This is a multibillion dollar catalyst that is currently not_being priced . Even the valuation shows google is STILL mispriced Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidias future while ignoring Googles present cash flow . Look at the PE ratio comparison . Google 32.6x PE . For Nvidia45.8x PE . That makes Google roughly 29 % cheaper on PE valuation basis . If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia its stock price would be roughly $ 460 . to hit $ 400 target al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly . Wall Street is quietly loading up Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $ 400 target . Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $ 400 target . Canaccord raised their target to $ 390 . they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings . The non digital assets Pixel 10 sales were up 28 % yearoveryear in September capturing 7 % of the US premium market and stealing share directly from Samsung . And Waymo driverless taxi is no_longer a side project . They are doing 450000 paid rides per week . They are live in Phoenix SF LA and expanding fast . TLDR Google is winning on search youtube ads cloud AI Chip driverless cars mobile phones and is about to become the worlds most valuable company . On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $ 380.50 and after the call continue to $ 400 . I ’ m holding 10k USD worth of $ 375C for Feb 6 . I am calling Google at $ 400 . I know that most of you are holding GOOG so good luck tp us all . Next earnings Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ GOOG GOOGL will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday February 4 at 130pm Pacific Time 430pm Eastern Time .

      "selftext": "If you had bought four shares of Nvidia at its 1999 IPO, it would have cost you about $48. After stock splits and one of the most extreme compounding runs in market history, those four original shares would today be worth just under $500,000. Now imagine applying that same compounding logic to SpaceX, even if it does not start small. Assume, conservatively, that any eventual public pricing begins around a $1.5 trillion valuation. That number sounds enormous until you shift the frame from cheap to foundational. The companies that generated generational wealth over the last 30 to 40 years were not just successful businesses. They became infrastructure. SpaceX is positioning itself in exactly that role, not merely as a rocket company, but as a transportation, launch, communications, and orbital logistics platform. If you care about truly building wealth, the kind you can give to your kids, the kind that pays for college and maybe even helps them buy their first home, I cannot think of a better company than SpaceX. It is still pre-IPO, but it is not hard to imagine a future where Musk works out some mechanism that allows ordinary people to buy in early. Maybe even young couples, with one simple condition, that they are actually building families. Population decline is a real problem, and it is something Musk talks about openly and often. This part is admittedly wishful thinking, and it may not even be legal as described, though history suggests there are always ways to make things possible when incentives align. Can't wait for the IPO! TLDR: SPACE X will be a long-term buy and hold as they are building out the larger space infrastructure.",

After stock splits and one of the most extreme compounding runs in market history those four original shares would today be worth just under $ 500000 . Now imagine applying that same compounding logic to SpaceX even if it does not_start small . Assume conservatively that any eventual public pricing begins around a $ 1.5 trillion valuation . That number sounds enormous until you shift the frame from cheap to foundational . The companies that generated generational wealth over the last 30 to 40 years were not_just successful businesses . They became infrastructure . SpaceX is positioning itself in exactly that role not_merely as a rocket company but as a transportation launch communications and orbital logistics platform . If you care about truly building wealth the kind you can give to your kids the kind that pays for college and maybe even helps them buy their first home I can not think of a better company than SpaceX . It is still preIPO but it is not_hard to imagine a future where Musk works out some mechanism that allows ordinary people to buy in early . Maybe even young couples with one simple condition that they are actually building families . Population decline is a real problem and it is something Musk talks about openly and often . This part is admittedly wishful thinking and it may not_even be legal as described though history suggests there are always ways to make things possible when incentives align . Cant wait for the IPO TLDR SPACE X will be a longterm buy and hold as they are building out the larger space infrastructure ."

      "selftext": "I am 19 years old. I had around 50,000$ saved up and most of it was invested in the S&P 500. I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined, with my spending. I made sure to put my money into the S&P 500 because I thought it was an investment. A days ago I made a huge mistake. I did something wrong and it was all my fault. I totally messed things up with my actions. The mistake I made was an one. It happened a few days ago. I was trading options. I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day. Trading options can be really bad, for me I mean I was doing okay. Then I made some bad choices. Now I have lost a lot of my capital. I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading. The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it. I think about why I did it and that's what makes it worse. Doing it was bad. The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse. I was really close to making a mistake with my money. I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right.. Then I thought about it. I knew it was a bad idea. It was too risky and not very smart. So I did not do it. A few hours went by. Then I heard some news, about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland. If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was lucky I did not make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons. The trade would have worked out well. It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right. I am glad I did not put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money. That really messed with my head. Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working. Seeing that was a shock, to me. I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right. That is when I started trading to get back at the market. I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good, for me. I did not have a plan. I was not managing my risk. I was only thinking about how I felt. I let my emotions take over. I was only thinking about revenge trading. My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone. I had a lot of money in my savings. Now half of my savings are just not there anymore. I feel sick. I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated. I just cannot stop thinking about what happened over in my head. My life is young. I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did. I keep thinking about my life. How I feel like I made a big mistake. My life and my choices are really bothering me. If anyone has gone through something like this. With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice, on options and gambling and revenge trading. • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without self-destructing again Right now, I feel completely lost. TL;DR: I’m 19. Had ~$50k saved (mostly S&P 500). Lost 50% of it in one day trading options after revenge trading. Missed a risky trade that would’ve turned $10k into ~$750k, got angry, abandoned discipline, and blew up half my savings. Now I feel devastated and like I ruined my life. Looking for advice on how to mentally recover and move forward.",

I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined with my spending . I made sure to put my money into the SP 500 because I thought it was an investment . A days ago I made a huge mistake . I did something wrong and it was all my fault . I totally messed things up with my actions . The mistake I made was an one . It happened a few days ago . I was trading options . I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day . Trading options can be really bad for me I mean I was doing okay . Then I made some bad choices . Now I have lost a lot of my capital . I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading . The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it . I think about why I did it and thats what makes it worse . Doing it was bad . The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse . I was really close to making a mistake with my money . I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right .. Then I thought about it . I knew it was a bad idea . It was too risky and not_very smart . So I did not_do it . A few hours went by . Then I heard some news about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland . If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars . I was lucky I did not_make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons . The trade would have worked out well . It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right . I am glad I did not_put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money . That really messed with my head . Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working . Seeing that was a shock to me . I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right . That is when I started trading to get back at the market . I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good for me . I did not_have a plan . I was not_managing my risk . I was only thinking about how I felt . I let my emotions take over . I was only thinking about revenge trading . My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone . I had a lot of money in my savings . Now half of my savings are just not_there anymore . I feel sick . I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated . I just can not stop thinking about what happened over in my head . My life is young . I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did . I keep thinking about my life . How I feel like I made a big mistake . My life and my choices are really bothering me . If anyone has gone through something like this . With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading . I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice on options and gambling and revenge trading . • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without selfdestructing again Right now I feel completely lost . TLDR I ’ m 19 . Had $ 50k saved mostly SP 500 . Lost 50 % of it in one day trading options after revenge trading .

      "title": "Why it’s not too late to get in: The Asymmetric Case for Nebius ($NBIS)",
      "selftext": "*Current Price: \\~$95* *Market Capitalization: \\~$24B* *Recommendation: Long* While the broader market remains cautious, a quantitative dissection of the forward-looking order book suggests Nebius Group ($NBIS) is currently trading at a dislocation from its fundamental value. Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle. **1. The Velocity of Revenue Recognition** The market is currently pricing $NBIS based on trailing indicators, largely ignoring the contracted revenue ramp scheduled to materialize over the next 12–24 months. We are looking at a potential year-over-year revenue acceleration of 521% to 1,400% between 2025 and 2026. This is not a speculative forecast derived from TAM (Total Addressable Market) assumptions; it is a function of a $20B+ backlog of unfilled orders. Crucially, more than 50% of the company's projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts. \\* 2025E (Fiscal Year): Revenue of $500–550M; Exit ARR of $900M–$1.1B. \\* 2026E (Guidance): Revenue expands to $3.45–7B; ARR target of $7–9B. \\* 2027E (Consensus): Revenue projected at $7.8–9B. \\* 2028E: Revenue projected to exceed $14B. **2. Structural De-Risking Events** Three specific catalysts have recently materialized, effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity: \\* Product Maturity (AI Cloud 3.1): The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform, integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary \"Capacity Blocks,\" real-time dashboards, and compliance architecture, moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage. It positions the firm as a full-stack enterprise cloud alternative. \\* Infrastructure Scale: Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW. This physical capacity is the prerequisite \"supply\" needed to service the verified backlog. \\* Counterparty Quality: The backlog is anchored by multi-year infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta. These are long-duration commitments from investment-grade counterparties, not volatile usage-based revenue from venture-backed startups. **3. The Valuation Compression Thesis** Skeptics often cite the current \\~50x price-to-sales multiple (on 2025E revenue) as a barrier to entry. However, this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator (revenue) growth. As the backlog converts to recognized revenue, the optical valuation compresses rapidly: \\* 2026E: At the $3.45–7B revenue range, the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales. \\* 2027E: At the $9B consensus projection, the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales. Given the $4.79B cash position on the balance sheet, the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk. **4. Price Target Sensitivity Analysis** Applying standard growth-adjusted multiples to the company's guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade. From a cost basis of $95, the potential upside scenarios are substantial. (Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header). **5. Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price** A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action. At $95, shares are trading 40% below the average analyst price target and 55% below the street-high target. \\* Northland Securities: $211 (122% Upside) \\* Citizens JMP: $175 (84% Upside) \\* Consensus Mean: $157.83 (66% Upside) \\* Sentiment: 5 Buys / 1 Hold / 0 Sells **Summary** The retracement from the October highs of $141 provides an attractive entry point. Fundamental performance remains robust, evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $146.1M (+355% YoY) and core infrastructure growth of +400%. With a clear path to $5B+ in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $20B+ backlog, I view $NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage. I remain a buyer at these levels. *Disclaimer: This analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.* **If you like my posts, please also take a look at my Substack in bio.**",

Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle . 1 .

We are looking at a potential yearoveryear revenue acceleration of 521 % to 1400 % between 2025 and 2026 . This is not_a speculative forecast derived from TAM Total Addressable Market assumptions it is a function of a $ 20B backlog of unfilled orders . Crucially more than 50 % of the companys projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts . 2025E Fiscal Year Revenue of $ 500–550M Exit ARR of $ 900M– $ 1.1B . 2026E Guidance Revenue expands to $ 3.45–7B ARR target of $ 7–9B . 2027E Consensus Revenue projected at $ 7.8–9B . 2028E Revenue projected to exceed $ 14B . 2 . Structural DeRisking Events Three specific catalysts have recently materialized effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity Product Maturity AI Cloud 3.1 The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary Capacity Blocks realtime dashboards and compliance architecture moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage . It positions the firm as a fullstack enterprise cloud alternative . Infrastructure Scale Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW . This physical capacity is the prerequisite supply needed to service the verified backlog . Counterparty Quality The backlog is anchored by multiyear infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta . These are longduration commitments from investmentgrade counterparties not_volatile usagebased revenue from venturebacked startups . 3 . The Valuation Compression Thesis Skeptics often cite the current 50x pricetosales multiple on 2025E revenue as a barrier to entry . However this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator revenue growth . As the backlog converts to recognized revenue the optical valuation compresses rapidly 2026E At the $ 3.45–7B revenue range the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales . 2027E At the $ 9B consensus projection the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales . Given the $ 4.79B cash position on the balance sheet the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk . 4 . Price Target Sensitivity Analysis Applying standard growthadjusted multiples to the companys guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade . From a cost basis of $ 95 the potential upside scenarios are substantial . Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header . 5 . Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action . At $ 95 shares are trading 40 % below the average analyst price target and 55 % below the streethigh target . Northland Securities $ 211 122 % Upside Citizens JMP $ 175 84 % Upside Consensus Mean $ 157.83 66 % Upside Sentiment 5 Buys 1 Hold 0 Sells Summary The retracement from the October highs of $ 141 provides an attractive entry point . Fundamental performance remains robust evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $ 146.1M 355 % YoY and core infrastructure growth of 400 % . With a clear path to $ 5B in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $ 20B backlog I view $ NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage . I remain a buyer at these levels .

      "selftext": "I’m old enough that I am required to take RMDs from my IRA, and fortunate enough to not have any immediate need for the money. In the past I’ve typically just taken the RMD, paid my taxes, and move the rest to a brokerage account. However, lately I’ve been thinking I’d be a lot better off putting that money into a Roth IRA. I understand I cannot do a direct rollover as taxes need to be paid. And I have no “earned” income that would allow me to simply just contribute to a Roth. Is there any way to accomplish this? Or am I out of luck here?",

      "selftext": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the likes incorrectly estimated that the S&P500 would beat the FTSE100 in 2025, I believe the same fundamental's that caused this will still exist in 2026. 1. Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28. This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends. 2. AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year. 3. Long Term Stability Trump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe. On the otherside, a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further. 4. Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5. USD Decline Even if European stocks do not intrinsically outperform the S&P 500, every time the world is graced with another truth social post, the USD falls. The USD was down 10% in 2025. 6. Trumpism As an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different? If threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4? In the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health: \\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines) \\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs) \\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps. \\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. TLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action. I am not saying go 0% US, but if you are sitting 100% US, maybe now is time to consider diversifying.",

Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average PE ratio versus the SP500s with an average PE of 17 to the SPs 28 . This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack . British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years and will still provide their relatively larger dividends . 2 . AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble . US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year . 3 . Long Term Stability Trumps stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics . The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe . On the otherside a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further . 4 . Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europes overregulation . This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5 . USD Decline Even if European stocks do not_intrinsically outperform the SP 500 every time the world is graced with another truth social post the USD falls . The USD was down 10 % in 2025 . 6 . Trumpism As an outsider with no_skin in the game I was concerned watching Bidens performance degrade over his term . Did Bidens health and performance improve over his presidency Why would President Trumps be any different If threatening to invade allies is Trumps Year 1 how exposed do I want to be to his year 4 In the FTSE your portfolio will be better insulated from Trumps degrading mental health You are not_going to have your stocks key product banned overnight wind turbines Or key manufaturing imports tariffed Canadas automotive imputs Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps . For as long as Trump is in power he is unpredictable but predictably more volatile as he gets older . TLDR I am bullish on Europe because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans or scaring the Europeans into action . I am not_saying go 0 % US but if you are sitting 100 % US maybe now is time to consider diversifying ."

It’s literally part of my compensation. Yet if I need it before some arbitrary age, I get punished with penalties and extra taxes like I committed a crime. People always say “it’s for your own good” or “it stops people from being irresponsible.” That’s not the government’s job. Adults should be allowed to make decisions, even bad ones, with their own money. If someone wants to save it for retirement, great. If someone needs it for a house, medical bills, starting a business, or just surviving, that should be their choice. What makes it even worse is that the rules are insanely complex. Hardship withdrawals, loans, exceptions, age limits, penalties, income tax stacked on top. It’s like the system is designed to scare people into never touching their own money unless they play by exact rules. If the government wants to encourage retirement savings, fine. Give tax incentives. But once the money is earned and deposited, it shouldn’t be locked behind penalties and fine print for decades. It’s not a retirement account anymore. It’s a leash.",

If someone needs it for a house medical bills starting a business or just surviving that should be their choice . What makes it even worse is that the rules are insanely complex . Hardship withdrawals loans exceptions age limits penalties income tax stacked on top . It ’ s like the system is designed to scare people into never_touching their own money unless they play by exact rules . If the government wants to encourage retirement savings fine . Give tax incentives . But once the money is earned and deposited it shouldn ’ t be locked behind penalties and fine print for decades . It ’ s not_a retirement account anymore . It ’ s a leash ."

      "selftext": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the likes incorrectly estimated that the S&P500 would beat the FTSE100 in 2025, I believe the same fundamental's that caused this will still exist in 2026. 1. Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28. This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends. 2. AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year. 3. Long Term Stability Trump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe. 4. Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape. 5. Trumpism As an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different? If threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4? In the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health: \\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines) \\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs) \\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps. \\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. TLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action. I am not saying go 0% US, but if you are sitting 100% US, maybe now is time to consider diversifying.",

      "selftext": "Before anything: I believe that AI is currently a bubble. Despite it growing in use day after day, it still isn't a full replaceable tool for most tasks. It feels intelligent, but it is still clunky and unreliable for a lot of things. I'm not pretending to understand more than the others, but I have noticed a pattern that has been proving itself true for a while. I believe that AI has reached to a point where it became too present to be a common bubble. The triggers for it are becoming more and more hard to achieve in the close future. The big companies are pumping money into eachother, but in the end they are actually *gambling* against eachother. They are putting money on the game, hoping to snatch away from the first one who falls on the race. Take OpenAI as an example. Had they declared a poor financial state by 2023, the bubble would had bursted far more quickly, because at the time they were pretty much the only big AI company. If they lose relevance nowadays, we still have other companies on the game. There will be a moment of fear, but it won't last long. For example, Gemini isn't the only Google product (and I argue that it isn't even their biggest spending). GOGL would take a hit, but there still would have reason to buy their stocks. On regard to the GPU producers, the main difference between the dot com bubble and this one is that now they have many other uses for it. Companies need computing power for LLMs, but they also need it for cloud storage and many other uses. Besides, every AI company is racing for AGI. When this happens, I seriously believe the bubble could be called down. My main point on this all is that it *may* happen, but now a lot of things should happen in sequence to trigger the bubble. And even if it is the case, it wouldn't pop suddenly. People are aware enough of it, and the tech stocks are extremely sensible (just look at Intel this week), so basically the market is correcting itself enough to avoid an uncontrolled overvaluation. It's precisely the fear that is regulating the size of the bubble. No one is buying NVDA like there is no tomorrow, like they did with Cisco in 2001. And even considering all that, and even if the bubble bursts suddenly, it's not science fiction to think that by 2040 and onwards AI will be thousands of times more powerful.",

      "selftext_processed": "Before anything I believe that AI is currently a bubble . Despite it growing in use day after day it still isnt a full replaceable tool for most tasks . It feels intelligent but it is still clunky and unreliable for a lot of things . Im not_pretending to understand more than the others but I have noticed a pattern that has been proving itself true for a while . I believe that AI has reached to a point where it became too present to be a common bubble . The triggers for it are becoming more and more hard to achieve in the close future . The big companies are pumping money into eachother but in the end they are actually gambling against eachother . They are putting money on the game hoping to snatch away from the first one who falls on the race . Take OpenAI as an example . Had they declared a poor financial state by 2023 the bubble would had bursted far more quickly because at the time they were pretty much the only big AI company . If they lose relevance nowadays we still have other companies on the game . There will be a moment of fear but it wont last long . For example Gemini isnt the only Google product and I argue that it isnt even their biggest spending . GOGL would take a hit but there still would have reason to buy their stocks . On regard to the GPU producers the main difference between the dot com bubble and this one is that now they have many other uses for it . Companies need computing power for LLMs but they also need it for cloud storage and many other uses . Besides every AI company is racing for AGI . When this happens I seriously believe the bubble could be called down . My main point on this all is that it may happen but now a lot of things should happen in sequence to trigger the bubble . And even if it is the case it wouldnt pop suddenly . People are aware enough of it and the tech stocks are extremely sensible just look at Intel this week so basically the market is correcting itself enough to avoid an uncontrolled overvaluation . Its precisely the fear that is regulating the size of the bubble . No_one is buying NVDA like there is no_tomorrow like they did with Cisco in 2001 . And even considering all that and even if the bubble bursts suddenly its not_science fiction to think that by 2040 and onwards AI will be thousands of times more powerful ."

      "selftext": "It is not clear to me why anyone should continue to own U.S. assets. Yes, U.S. capital markets are deep, and many American companies are exceptional, but the political risk assumed by owning American assets today outweighs the benefit of participating in an economy governed by a mad king with no apparent restraints or accountability of any kind. At this point, any person or entity investing in the U.S. is directly (U.S. Treasuries) or indirectly (U.S. private assets) enabling the Trump regime to inflict incalculable damage on the world order, not to mention running the risk of having their assets confiscated or stranded due to some flimsy political or security excuse. Countries not subject to the rule of law, such as the United States,.represent a clear and imminent danger to all those exposed to them. As such, investing in the United States today is both more morally questionable and more financially irresponsible. What guarantee do Canadian or European investors have today that their U.S. stock or bond holdings won’t be subject to severe taxation by executive order? Think “Greenland Security Reparations”? Or a “North America Golden Dome Funding Charge”? Anything is possible when the individual in charge is unhinged and faces no apparent democratic oversight. Meanwhile, I would think twice about owning gold or silver in the U.S. today. Should the U.S. dollar continue to weaken and these hard assets continue to rally, Trump may deem their ascent an affront to the supremacy of the U.S. dollar and outlaw private ownership. And don’t think this hasn’t happened before (see Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102). Finally, with Trump turning the U.S. into a global pariah, what do you think will happen to U.S. companies’ sales abroad over time? Consumers and governments around the world will undoubtedly increasingly shun U.S. technology (to the extent possible) and U.S. consumer and industrial products and services in favor of national or other non-U.S. alternatives. And with over 40% of S&P 500 companies’ revenues coming from international markets, the hit to their bottom lines will be felt. I, for one, sold my last U.S. stock in Q4 last year. I recommend that you do the same.",

      "selftext_processed": "It is not_clear to me why anyone should continue to own U.S. assets . Yes U.S. capital markets are deep and many American companies are exceptional but the political risk assumed by owning American assets today outweighs the benefit of participating in an economy governed by a mad king with no_apparent restraints or accountability of any kind . At this point any person or entity investing in the U.S. is directly U.S. Treasuries or indirectly U.S. private assets enabling the Trump regime to inflict incalculable damage on the world order not_to mention running the risk of having their assets confiscated or stranded due to some flimsy political or security excuse . Countries not_subject to the rule of law such as the United States.represent a clear and imminent danger to all those exposed to them . As such investing in the United States today is both more morally questionable and more financially irresponsible . What guarantee do Canadian or European investors have today that their U.S. stock or bond holdings won ’ t be subject to severe taxation by executive order Think “ Greenland Security Reparations ” Or a “ North America Golden Dome Funding Charge ” Anything is possible when the individual in charge is unhinged and faces no_apparent democratic oversight . Meanwhile I would think twice about owning gold or silver in the U.S. today . Should the U.S. dollar continue to weaken and these hard assets continue to rally Trump may deem their ascent an affront to the supremacy of the U.S. dollar and outlaw private ownership . And don ’ t think this hasn ’ t happened before see Franklin D. Roosevelt ’ s Executive Order 6102 . Finally with Trump turning the U.S. into a global pariah what do you think will happen to U.S. companies ’ sales abroad over time Consumers and governments around the world will undoubtedly increasingly shun U.S. technology to the extent possible and U.S. consumer and industrial products and services in favor of national or other nonU.S . alternatives . And with over 40 % of SP 500 companies ’ revenues coming from international markets the hit to their bottom lines will be felt . I for one sold my last U.S. stock in Q4 last year . I recommend that you do the same ."

      "selftext": "Imagine you have $100,000 in 2013 and you need to decide what to invest in. Here are a few options: \\- A 1-bedroom condo in a Boston suburb, which was priced around $110,000 is now close to $350,000 in value, resulting in a 3.18x return (or approximately $318,000 after normalization). \\- Gold, which was priced around $1,200 per ounce, increased to $4,000 per ounce, resulting in a 3.33x return (or approximately $333,000). \\- VOO, which was around $140, increased to $636, resulting in a 4.54x return (or approximately $454,000, based solely on price appreciation). Based on this 2013-2026 investment window, stocks appear to be the better option compared to gold and real estate. However, with gold currently priced at around $4,000 per ounce, it raises questions about the notion that stocks are always the safest long-term investment. My perspective is that the belief in the safety of investing in gold and land is often driven by a desire for stress relief and control, rather than solely by the potential for returns. Stocks can be emotionally challenging due to market fluctuations and news headlines, but they offer a relatively straightforward investment strategy with the ability to set and forget through index funds. Real estate, while potentially more stable on a day-to-day basis, can be illiquid and requires ongoing maintenance and management, such as HOA fees, repairs, and property taxes. Gold, on the other hand, is relatively easy to hold, but it lacks the potential for compounding returns and can experience significant price volatility over extended periods. I wonder if there are other factors that I may be overlooking, such as the impact of dividends, the potential for real estate leverage and rental income, or the influence of taxes on investment returns. I am not even thinking about NASDAQ stocks QQQ, which had much higher returns nor crypto. I’m just thinking like a long-term safe investor and not like a super nerdy stock market guy, which are very few who know when to get in and when get out. .",

      "selftext_processed": "Imagine you have $ 100000 in 2013 and you need to decide what to invest in . Here are a few options A 1bedroom condo in a Boston suburb which was priced around $ 110000 is now close to $ 350000 in value resulting in a 3.18x return or approximately $ 318000 after normalization . Gold which was priced around $ 1200 per ounce increased to $ 4000 per ounce resulting in a 3.33x return or approximately $ 333000 . VOO which was around $ 140 increased to $ 636 resulting in a 4.54x return or approximately $ 454000 based solely on price appreciation . Based on this 20132026 investment window stocks appear to be the better option compared to gold and real estate . However with gold currently priced at around $ 4000 per ounce it raises questions about the notion that stocks are always the safest longterm investment . My perspective is that the belief in the safety of investing in gold and land is often driven by a desire for stress relief and control rather than solely by the potential for returns . Stocks can be emotionally challenging due to market fluctuations and news headlines but they offer a relatively straightforward investment strategy with the ability to set and forget through index funds . Real estate while potentially more stable on a daytoday basis can be illiquid and requires ongoing maintenance and management such as HOA fees repairs and property taxes . Gold on the other hand is relatively easy to hold but it lacks the potential for compounding returns and can experience significant price volatility over extended periods . I wonder if there are other factors that I may be overlooking such as the impact of dividends the potential for real estate leverage and rental income or the influence of taxes on investment returns . I am not_even thinking about NASDAQ stocks QQQ which had much higher returns nor crypto . I ’ m just thinking like a longterm safe investor and not_like a super nerdy stock market guy which are very few who know when to get in and when get out . ."

Trump, referring to Prime Minister Mark Carney as “Governor Carney,” said Canada was “sorely mistaken” for allowing China to increase its imports of electric vehicles. Trump has trolled Canada about his desire for it to become the 51st US state. “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump said in a social media post. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all",

      "selftext": "*I would like to preface this by saying I had attempted to post this on or around December 31, 2025 but was unable due to account newness.* *As a result I'm posting this now, despite not being as fresh-to-market news, to ensure those who are looking into FinTech in the current landscape are aware of the risks present.* \\------- Dave Inc. (DAVE) has recently received a significant threat to its business model as of December 30, 2025. \\***Judicial and regulatory bodies are beginning to clamp down on predatory FinTech practices which are being masked as voluntary contributions, charitable tips, and fees & charges.**\\* \\*\\***The small news that skipped headlines (but with a big cascade risk) is the Baltimore v Dave Inc lawsuit filed December 30, 2025**\\*\\* If the Baltimore City lawsuit (filed December 30, 2025) successfully argues that these charges are \"finance charges\" under 12 C.F.R. § 1026.4 (Regulation Z), Dave’s effective APR (often exceeding 400%) would violate Maryland’s 33% usury cap and significantly impact Dave's bottom line, profitability and business model. This follows the precedent in District of Columbia v. EarnIn (Nov. 2024), where the DC Attorney General sued a near-identical provider for charging fees that yielded a 300% APR, rejecting the defense that these payments were voluntary \"donations.\" \\**This led to the case law and precedent referred to as \\*EarnIn doctrine\\* that donations are not voluntary, and fees are part of the loan*.\\* \\**Critically*\\* the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulatory integration of the doctrine into the 2024 Interpretive Rule. This regulation has been refined in \\*\\*December 2025\\*\\* enforcing the interpretation that \"tips\" and \"expedited delivery fees\" are considered \"credit\" subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) if they are part and parcel of the extension of funds. DAVE and other FinTech/BNPL/Advance lenders rely on state Safe Harbor laws to bypass APR limits currently. Other lenders are also getting rapidly hit by agencies (California DFPI v OppFi, Baltimore v MoneyLion, 2025, New York AG v MoneyLion, CFPB v MoneyLion, DC v EarnIn 2025, FTC v CleoAI, Rubin v EarnIn, Aug 2025, and the number of lawsuits are increasing) The problem? \\*\\***More Precedents!\\***\\* City of Miami v. Gonzalez (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2025), which went to Court of Appeals final ruling established that municipal charters can empower cities to enforce local consumer protections even where state laws are permissive, effectively allowing Baltimore to and other cities to ignore state level permission laws \\*AND apply the EarnIn Doctrine\\*. As a double whammy, the DOJ is naming CEO Jason Wilk as a personal defendant in its amended complaint (Dec. 2025), which is almost a replica of the FTC v Brigit 2024 case, where Brigit had to pay a $18 million settlement for deceptive fee-harvesting interfaces \\*\\**AND a permanent injunction*\\*\\*. CleoAI also had to settle a case with conditions against the FTC for $17M. On an ethical and legal front, recent revelations of exploiting \"charitable\" nudges to the bottom line $149 million tip revenue, Dave is increasingly exposed to a multi-front wave of municipal and federal litigation, and also souring retail & ethical sentiment. If these revenue drivers are deemed illegal interest, Dave loses its primary margin engine. Its core revenue generator turns into an unlicensed, high-interest loan. A single 40k share institutional sell block on Dec 29 over a holiday trading period immediately following the news, is a warning signal investors might want to be aware of if currently holding a DAVE position. While some risk is built into the current price, a bigger downside risk exists if multiple city & state jurisdictions follow Baltimore's lead - possibility of numerous settlements, restrictions and injunctions can potentially severely cripple the business model. \\**Disclaimer: Previous Dave bull here. I post this to help ensure I give a transparent take on any stocks I have held or hold, especially when I see big regulatory headwinds, as I don't want others to get burnt on a stock. I have exited DAVE due to this increasing risk. Not AI*\\*",

      "selftext_processed": "I would like to preface this by saying I had attempted to post this on or around December 31 2025 but was unable due to account newness . As a result Im posting this now despite not_being as freshtomarket news to ensure those who are looking into FinTech in the current landscape are aware of the risks present . Dave Inc. DAVE has recently received a significant threat to its business model as of December 30 2025 . Judicial and regulatory bodies are beginning to clamp down on predatory FinTech practices which are being masked as voluntary contributions charitable tips and fees charges . The small news that skipped headlines but with a big cascade risk is the Baltimore v Dave Inc lawsuit filed December 30 2025 If the Baltimore City lawsuit filed December 30 2025 successfully argues that these charges are finance charges under 12 C.F.R . § 1026.4 Regulation Z Dave ’ s effective APR often exceeding 400 % would violate Maryland ’ s 33 % usury cap and significantly impact Daves bottom line profitability and business model . This follows the precedent in District of Columbia v. EarnIn Nov. 2024 where the DC Attorney General sued a nearidentical provider for charging fees that yielded a 300 % APR rejecting the defense that these payments were voluntary donations . This led to the case law and precedent referred to as EarnIn doctrine that donations are not_voluntary and fees are part of the loan . Critically the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus CFPB Regulatory integration of the doctrine into the 2024 Interpretive Rule . This regulation has been refined in December 2025 enforcing the interpretation that tips and expedited delivery fees are considered credit subject to the Truth in Lending Act TILA if they are part and parcel of the extension of funds . DAVE and other FinTechBNPLAdvance lenders rely on state Safe Harbor laws to bypass APR limits currently . Other lenders are also getting rapidly hit by agencies California DFPI v OppFi Baltimore v MoneyLion 2025 New York AG v MoneyLion CFPB v MoneyLion DC v EarnIn 2025 FTC v CleoAI Rubin v EarnIn Aug 2025 and the number of lawsuits are increasing The problem More Precedents City of Miami v. Gonzalez Fla. Dist . Ct. App . 2025 which went to Court of Appeals final ruling established that municipal charters can empower cities to enforce local consumer protections even where state laws are permissive effectively allowing Baltimore to and other cities to ignore state level permission laws AND apply the EarnIn Doctrine . As a double whammy the DOJ is naming CEO Jason Wilk as a personal defendant in its amended complaint Dec. 2025 which is almost a replica of the FTC v Brigit 2024 case where Brigit had to pay a $ 18 million settlement for deceptive feeharvesting interfaces AND a permanent injunction . CleoAI also had to settle a case with conditions against the FTC for $ 17M . On an ethical and legal front recent revelations of exploiting charitable nudges to the bottom line $ 149 million tip revenue Dave is increasingly exposed to a multifront wave of municipal and federal litigation and also souring retail ethical sentiment . If these revenue drivers are deemed illegal interest Dave loses its primary margin engine . Its core revenue generator turns into an unlicensed highinterest loan . A single 40k share institutional sell block on Dec 29 over a holiday trading period immediately following the news is a warning signal investors might want to be aware of if currently holding a DAVE position . While some risk is built into the current price a bigger downside risk exists if multiple city state jurisdictions follow Baltimores lead possibility of numerous settlements restrictions and injunctions can potentially severely cripple the business model . Disclaimer Previous Dave bull here . I post this to help ensure I give a transparent take on any stocks I have held or hold especially when I see big regulatory headwinds as I dont want others to get burnt on a stock . I have exited DAVE due to this increasing risk . Not_AI"

Just because EM has underperformed the last 2 decades doesnt mean it will continue to do so for the next 2 decades . Why shouldnt I just throw it all into an Avantis EM factor ETF"

The second thing that came to mind for me after hearing it was what investing takeaways can I get from this speech? So with the help of a friendly bot, I have the following stocks: # Theme 1: Energy Security & “Friendly Supply” # Investment Implications Expect **long-duration capital flows** into Canadian energy that can: * Export reliably * Operate under ESG scrutiny * Survive political cycles # Opportunities * **Canadian Natural Resources** * Long-life assets, low decline rates * Massive free cash flow * Fits “reliable supplier” narrative * **Suncor Energy** * Integrated model = resilience * Energy security + refining leverage * **Enbridge** * Tolls > commodity prices * Exactly the “plumbing of geopolitics” Carney is hinting at **Portfolio role:** Core income + geopolitical hedge # Theme 2: Critical Minerals & Strategic Commodities # Investment Implications Canada wants to be a **non-China minerals hub** for: * EVs * Defense * AI infrastructure # Opportunities * **Teck Resources** * Copper + zinc = electrification backbone * Already repositioning toward future-facing metals * **Lundin Mining** * Copper-heavy portfolio * Direct beneficiary of buyer-club dynamics * **Lithium Americas** * Geopolitically sensitive asset class * Binary risk, but massive upside if policy aligns **Portfolio role:** Strategic growth, policy-levered upside # Theme 3: Financial Infrastructure & Capital Markets Power # Investment Implications * Increased global capital routing through Canadian banks * Demand for **risk-managed, boring financial systems** * Stable dividend growth # Opportunities * **Royal Bank of Canada** * Global reach + conservative balance sheet * Wins in volatile geopolitics * **Brookfield Corporation** * Infrastructure, energy transition, real assets * Basically a *financial expression* of Carney’s worldview **Portfolio role:** Defensive growth + global optionality # Theme 4: AI Governance, Data, and “Trusted Tech” # Investment Implications * Demand for data centers * Regulated AI platforms * Enterprise software aligned with compliance # Opportunities * **Constellation Software** * Vertical market software * Benefits from regulation, not hurt by it * **OpenText** * Data governance, compliance, security * Quiet winner in AI regulation era **Portfolio role:** Low-hype AI exposure with real cash flow # Theme 5: Defense, NATO, and Northern Security # Investment Implications * Arctic security * Aerospace * Surveillance and systems integration # Opportunities * **CAE** * Military flight simulation * NATO-aligned budgets = steady demand * **MDA** * Space-based surveillance * Arctic monitoring relevance rising fast **Portfolio role:** Geopolitical hedge + tech-adjacent defenseTheme 1: Energy Security & “Friendly Supply” The only stocks I currently own that would be considered Canadian are MDA (MDALF), and FFMGF.

Alongside USAR, there is UUUU, NB, AREC and UAMY are all in similar positions and exciting to watch unfold. I have entered USAR somewhat late at \\~$25 on an EOD stop buy order. I’m aware I have missed the “setup” so my SL is further than normal, however I expect further accumulation here after a potential for some chop (and possible position increase) in the meantime. RKLB and ASTS, both space tech with incredibly high RS relative to the broader market seem to have eased off slightly, to which I believe to be another big move. I have entered RKLB at \\~$90 on an EOD stop buy order after a pullback to the 20 and return to the 10. Unfortunately my order triggered on little volume. I do think there is growth potential here. I will also mention Cryptocurrency, after a long \\~50 day downtrend of 30%-50% the leading coins (BTC, ETH) have formed their fourth higher low since the downtrend. Speculation in the community is getting louder and I believe there may be opportunities for short term swings there as well. Let me know your thoughts and how you’re currently approaching trading. 🤟",

The plan is to dollar cost average a small amount every week and hold for 20 plus years with no trading or market timing. This is meant to be a buy and forget hedge alongside equities. For gold, I’m specifically looking at GLD versus IAU. For silver, I’m looking at SLV versus SLVR.

      "selftext": "Gold and Silver up recently. Danger territory, it can grow further or decline. If positions closed now the current profit will be locked, but the **future profit missed**. What to do? (no good solution for Silver) **Gold**: protect with puts x0.85 6months. Puts are cheap, good solution. Won't protect against slow and long decline though. **Silver**: no good solution, options are very, very, very expensive. **1)** Close 50-100% of silver positions and move it into Gold protected with puts. **2)** Explosive hedge. Buy large volume (x4 of stock volume), of cheap far otm puts x0.5 4months. Won't help in small-medium decline. But for large sudden drop could go x10 and reduce losses. **3)** Close silver positions and move to silver miners (say WPM). They say silver miners are not yet fully appreciate silver metal up move, so for silver miners the upside potential could be higher. Silver Miners are more reactive than the silver, both up and down. Yet - strangely, puts on miners are a little bit cheaper than puts on silver. So strange situations - more volatile with higher up potential and with cheaper puts. I think at least 30% of silver positions should be closed and go into silver miners protected with puts. Still puts are very costly. **4)** Close silver positions, use 5-10% of money to buy WPM call x1.5 1-2years. The call is insanely costly and would go almost to zero with medium decline, yet 90% of silver profit will stay safe and there will be some exposure to future up move. I have been thinking about this for days, can't decide what to do with silver, any **better ideas**? Note - in my opinion options are better on GLD/SLV because of high liquidity. Yet for positions it's safer to use PHYS/PSLV or miners stocks.",

What to do no good solution for Silver Gold protect with puts x0.85 6months . Puts are cheap good solution . Wont protect against slow and long decline though . Silver no_good solution options are very very very expensive . 1 Close 50100 % of silver positions and move it into Gold protected with puts . 2 Explosive hedge . Buy large volume x4 of stock volume of cheap far otm puts x0.5 4months . Wont help in smallmedium decline . But for large sudden drop could go x10 and reduce losses . 3 Close silver positions and move to silver miners say WPM . They say silver miners are not_yet fully appreciate silver metal up move so for silver miners the upside potential could be higher . Silver Miners are more reactive than the silver both up and down . Yet strangely puts on miners are a little bit cheaper than puts on silver . So strange situations more volatile with higher up potential and with cheaper puts . I think at least 30 % of silver positions should be closed and go into silver miners protected with puts . Still puts are very costly . 4 Close silver positions use 510 % of money to buy WPM call x1.5 12years . The call is insanely costly and would go almost to zero with medium decline yet 90 % of silver profit will stay safe and there will be some exposure to future up move . I have been thinking about this for days cant decide what to do with silver any better ideas Note in my opinion options are better on GLDSLV because of high liquidity . Yet for positions its safer to use PHYSPSLV or miners stocks ."

      "selftext": "I have an asset allocation target including various percentages of: * VOO (VFIAX, S&P 500 index fund) * VB (VSMAX, Small-Cap index fund) * VTV (VVIAX, Value index fund) (along with other non-US-stock and non-stock securities). My retirement accounts currently reflect that target. However, I also have some VTI (VTSAX, Total Stock Market Index) in a taxable account. I don't want to sell that taxable-account VTI to actually reallocate it to VOO, VB, and VTV. (I don't want to trigger capital gains now.) However, I would like to factor that VTI in to my asset allocation (that is, in my retirement accounts, reduce each of VOO, VB, and VTV holdings a bit, since VTI overlaps with those (and increase the other securities correspondingly)). What percentages of VOO, VB, and VTV is VTI roughly equivalent to? If I'm not missing something, VTI is equivalent to some amounts of VOO, VB, and VTV, plus some of whatever VTI covers but those three do not. (Right?) Does anyone here know, or can anyone tell how to find out or compute, those proportions of VOO, VB, and VTV, and that uncovered portion? (Or just: What fractions of the VTI should I consider as counting toward the VOO allocation, the VB allocation, and the VTV allocation? I know it can't be exactly equivalent (since VTI contains things not in funds in my target allocation); I'm just looking for a first-order approximation.) Thanks.",

Actual EPS has consistently come in above expectations, and forward estimates haven’t rolled over going into the next report (Jan 28). At META’s scale, that kind of sustained earnings momentum feels harder to dismiss than a one-off beat. I’m not ignoring valuation here META isn’t cheap on traditional multiples but the earnings trajectory looks stronger than the broader narrative I still see around the stock. What I’ve found helpful is tracking earnings vs expectations over time (I use Blossom to visualize this across quarters), because it makes it easier to separate short-term price noise from underlying execution. For those who follow META or large-cap tech more generally: Do you still weigh earnings momentum heavily at this size? Or does valuation dominate once companies reach this scale?[](",

      "selftext": "I keep seeing posts claiming “European pension funds are selling US Treasuries” and that it’s some major “Sell America” wave. But if you look at the official U.S. Treasury TIC data, total foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities are at/near all time highs. Treasury TIC (Major Foreign Holders/ able 5) shows the “Grand Total”, around $9.36T (recent monthly data). That’s the opposite of a mass exit. Even Reuters just reported Europe accounted for a huge share of foreign Treasury buying over recent months (The “Europe is dumping” narrative doesn’t match flows). Yes, some specific funds may divest for their own reasons (for example: Denmark had a pension fund selling a $100M Treasury position). But $100M is basically a rounding error vs a $9+ trillion foreign-held market. So in my opinion a lot of this “Europe is dumping bonds” stuff looks like headline amplification/fear engagement farming rather than reality. Sources: \\- U.S. Treasury TIC Table 5 (Major Foreign Holders): [ \\-Reuters (Jan 22): Europe accounted for 80% of foreign buying of U.S. Treasuries from April–Nov (per Citi portfolio data) [ Non paywall: [ Curious what \\*REAL\\* people think: Are we looking at an actual sustained “Sell America” shift or just a few symbolic moves being turned into a viral narrative?",

But if you look at the official U.S. Treasury TIC data total foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities are atnear all time highs . Treasury TIC Major Foreign Holders able 5 shows the “ Grand Total ” around $ 9.36T recent monthly data . That ’ s the opposite of a mass exit . Even Reuters just reported Europe accounted for a huge share of foreign Treasury buying over recent months The “ Europe is dumping ” narrative doesn ’ t match flows . Yes some specific funds may divest for their own reasons for example Denmark had a pension fund selling a $ 100M Treasury position . But $ 100M is basically a rounding error vs a $ 9 trillion foreignheld market . So in my opinion a lot of this “ Europe is dumping bonds ” stuff looks like headline amplificationfear engagement farming rather than reality . Sources U.S. Treasury TIC Table 5 Major Foreign Holders Reuters Jan 22 Europe accounted for 80 % of foreign buying of U.S. Treasuries from April–Nov per Citi portfolio data Non paywall Curious what REAL people think Are we looking at an actual sustained “ Sell America ” shift or just a few symbolic moves being turned into a viral narrative"

(NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

Two huge American companies that print billions each year will be born and currently the shares are at a level reminding me of GE during 2008 or cheaper. I’m temped to jump really deep into this stock,… even if Buffets replacement is going to sell it. I personally see it as a way to split himself from Buffet himself and less about true economics. Could do a whole DD on Kraft and Heinz … but … it feels like something else is going on here. I guess I’m asking does anyone else think this stock is literally just toxic based on emotions? The underlying facts say this is gonna print money post split. What am I missing? Roast away if I’m missing something obvious.",

      "selftext": "The ongoing proceedings have confirmed that Google’s \"Play Store\" dominance is being challenged not just on a monetary basis (the 30% fee), but on a technical infrastructure level. The court is focused on the \"friction\" Google creates to prevent third-party app stores and direct installations. 1. The Risk for Google ($GOOGL): Google’s high-margin Services segment relies on the \"toll-gate\" model. If the judge enforces the October Injunction (as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing), Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system. \"Scare Screens\" Ban: The court is moving toward banning the \"warning\" messages users see when side-loading apps. This removes Google’s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition. Google is under fire for trying to implement \"security fees\" to replace lost commissions. The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that aren't based on actual marginal costs. 2. The Opportunity for Digital Turbine ($APPS): The SingleTap Patent Moat: During the trial, it was revealed that Epic conducted A/B testing with Digital Turbine. The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT’s \"frictionless\" installation technology compared to Google’s standard flow. As the \"Gatekeeper\" walls fall, third-party stores (Xbox Mobile, Epic Store, Meta Direct Ads) need a delivery mechanism. Digital Turbine’s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally. The \"March 2026\" Inflection Point: With the judge rejecting a \"sweetheart deal\" between Google and Epic on Jan 22, the original, more aggressive injunction remains the baseline. This paves the way for a massive scaling of installations/day for DT starting in H2 2026. 3. The Epic Games Factor: Epic isn't just fighting for Fortnite; they are fighting for the right to run a full-scale mobile marketplace. Their reliance on DT’s tech during testing proves that the \"Alternative Distribution\" market is ready for commercial scale. The market is currently pricing in \"uncertainty,\" but the technical filings suggest a structural shift. If Google is forced to open its APIs by March, the \"operating leverage\" for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant re-rating as they transition from ad-networks to core utility infrastructure for Android.

      "selftext": "Tesla's stock price is being floated to obscene valuations (250-300 P/E in recent months) in part by promises of robotaxis. That implies whatever Tesla is doing is going to be wildly profitable. But what evidence is there that this business model can even do that? So far Tesla's best competitor is Waymo, a subsidiary of Google, who are the number one name in autonomous taxis. The thing is, on Google's [SEC filings]( Waymo's revenue is just grouped into the \"Other Bets\" category and that came to only $344M in revenue (not profits) in Q3 2025. If being placed into the \"Other Bets\" category doesn't inspire confidence, what can? Now for comparison, Tesla's total [Q3 revenue]( was $21B, and that number needs to be meaningfully improved by future taxi revenue. So we are to believe Tesla is going to come onto the scene and in a matter of a few years do something to this industry that Waymo couldn't do in over a decade?

That implies whatever Tesla is doing is going to be wildly profitable . But what evidence is there that this business model can even do that So far Teslas best competitor is Waymo a subsidiary of Google who are the number one name in autonomous taxis . The thing is on Googles SEC filings Waymos revenue is just grouped into the Other Bets category and that came to only $ 344M in revenue not profits in Q3 2025 . If being placed into the Other Bets category doesnt inspire confidence what can Now for comparison Teslas total Q3 revenue was $ 21B and that number needs to be meaningfully improved by future taxi revenue . So we are to believe Tesla is going to come onto the scene and in a matter of a few years do something to this industry that Waymo couldnt do in over a decade All while having worse self driving technology and being further from approval than Waymo was several years ago Ok ."

Futures pushing through $4,900 after making repeated highs in such a short time feels more like a structural shift than a trade. What stood out to me is that banks like Goldman are saying private investors are now competing with central banks for supply, mostly through ETFs, after rate cuts kicked in. Their $5,400 target for next year is aggressive, but the logic is that this money isn’t “hot” it’s allocation-driven. Geopolitics keeps reinforcing it too. Every major headline this year Venezuela, tariffs, broader policy uncertainty gold catches a bid. UBS basically echoed the same view, calling gold a reliable hedge again, with $5k as a base case and upside if tensions stick around. With gold already up double digits YTD after last year’s run, it feels like a lot of people are treating it less like insurance and more like a core macro position. Personally, I’ve been following it more closely since getting easier TradFi access on platforms like Bitget TradFi, where tracking gold alongside other macro markets is pretty straightforward. Curious how others here are thinking about this move late stage, or still room to run?",

      "title": "AIG: Quietly Undervalued + Catalyst Setup?",
      "selftext": "Been doing a bit of digging on AIG lately and I’m genuinely surprised how little attention it gets relative to its fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. **1. Valuation is still cheap vs peers** AIG is still trading at a noticeable discount to peers on most metrics (P/E, P/B, and even forward EV/earnings), despite having completed a multi-year restructuring that materially de-risked the business and improved underwriting discipline. The market seems to be pricing AIG like it’s still stuck in the pre-Corebridge days, even though a big part of that drag has already been carved out. **2. The CEO turnover panic looks overdone** The latest selloff was mostly sentiment-driven around the CEO transition. But if you actually read the details, it’s not a messy exit. The succession plan was already in place, the incoming CEO has a very solid profile for the role, and the outgoing CEO isbecoming Executive Chairman. That actually reduces transition risk because the strategic direction isn’t getting ripped up overnight. The anouncement was a bit of a surprise so knee-jerk dip was expected… but the underlying business didn’t suddenly change because someone moved one seat over. **3. Earnings catalyst on deck** AIG tends to beat forecasts more often than not, and we’re heading into the next report after a period of multiple tailwinds: underwriting continues to improve pricing in commercial lines is still favorable capital returns have been strong no obvious blow-ups on the balance sheet If that pattern repeats (and historically it often has), you get the double effect of “oh, the numbers are actually fine” + “the transition isn’t a disaster.” That’s exactly the kind of setup that re-rates a stock from sentiment lows. Not saying it’s guaranteed, but structurally there is room for a sharp sentiment reversal in the next few weeks if earnings come in strong and guidance holds especially since the bear case for the dip was mostly narrative, not fundamentals. Lemme know your thoughts and prayers.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been doing a bit of digging on AIG lately and I ’ m genuinely surprised how little attention it gets relative to its fundamentals and upcoming catalysts . 1 . Valuation is still cheap vs peers AIG is still trading at a noticeable discount to peers on most metrics PE PB and even forward EVearnings despite having completed a multiyear restructuring that materially derisked the business and improved underwriting discipline . The market seems to be pricing AIG like it ’ s still stuck in the preCorebridge days even though a big part of that drag has already been carved out . 2 . The CEO turnover panic looks overdone The latest selloff was mostly sentimentdriven around the CEO transition . But if you actually read the details it ’ s not_a messy exit . The succession plan was already in place the incoming CEO has a very solid profile for the role and the outgoing CEO isbecoming Executive Chairman . That actually reduces transition risk because the strategic direction isn ’ t getting ripped up overnight . The anouncement was a bit of a surprise so kneejerk dip was expected… but the underlying business didn ’ t suddenly change because someone moved one seat over . 3 . Earnings catalyst on deck AIG tends to beat forecasts more often than not_and we ’ re heading into the next report after a period of multiple tailwinds underwriting continues to improve pricing in commercial lines is still favorable capital returns have been strong no_obvious blowups on the balance sheet If that pattern repeats and historically it often has you get the double effect of “ oh the numbers are actually fine ” “ the transition isn ’ t a disaster. ” That ’ s exactly the kind of setup that rerates a stock from sentiment lows . Not_saying it ’ s guaranteed but structurally there is room for a sharp sentiment reversal in the next few weeks if earnings come in strong and guidance holds especially since the bear case for the dip was mostly narrative not_fundamentals . Lem me know your thoughts and prayers ."

      "title": "Yearly report reveals 5th largest pensionfund in the world quietly sold 10 out of its 29 billion in US Bonds",
      "selftext": "Transelated version; > The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025, just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world. This is evident from their most recent investment overview, which ABP always publishes with a three-month delay. > At the end of March, the value of US government bonds in ABP's books was still more than €29 billion. At the end of September, ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US, more than a third less. > Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US. The billions that are no longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany. During the same period, ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany. > In an interview with Fox News yesterday, Trump threatened “major retaliation” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds. With around €500 billion in pension funds, ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide. > **Multiple factors** > The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value. Rising interest rates on government bonds, for example, can depress their value. In addition, the new Dutch pension system may also play a role. Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds. > In this case, the higher interest rates are not playing a major role, according to pension experts. Shortly after Trump's announcement of import tariffs in April 2025, bond interest rates rose sharply, but that increase has been virtually wiped out. So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value, says Bas Werker, professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar. > Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP, according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON: “If you exchange US bonds for European bonds, you are not disposing of bonds.” > **Selling** > ABP's deliberate policy, i.e., selling or not repurchasing, therefore seems to play a major role. “Trump's unpredictability, and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty, are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and non-financial resilience,” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels. > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. > ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively. “That is what our investment mix is aimed at,” said the spokesperson. Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies. > **US debt** > For decades, the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world, but rising government spending is increasing the national debt. This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts. > High debt is not a problem as long as enough countries, investors, and individuals are willing to hold dollars. Trump's import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries. Since his second term as president, the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent. > Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank, the Fed, to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This fall, the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds. > **Danish pension funds** > This week, it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds. These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights. A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trump's threat to take Greenland. > “This decision is the result of weak US public finances,” said Anders Schelde, head of investments at the Danish teachers' pension fund. According to him, it is a matter of risk management. The money is now being invested in less risky investments. > Like ABP, the Danish teachers' pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the two cannot be viewed entirely separately: “Of course, that doesn't make it any easier to take such a decision,” said Schelde. I thought this part was interesting; > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. Refusing to comment as to why, sounds like they're planning to sell off more?",

      "selftext_processed": "Transelated version The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025 just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world . This is evident from their most recent investment overview which ABP always publishes with a threemonth delay . At the end of March the value of US government bonds in ABPs books was still more than €29 billion . At the end of September ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US more than a third less . Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US . The billions that are no_longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany . During the same period ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany . In an interview with Fox News yesterday Trump threatened “ major retaliation ” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds . With around €500 billion in pension funds ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide . Multiple factors The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value . Rising interest rates on government bonds for example can depress their value . In addition the new Dutch pension system may also play a role . Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds . In this case the higher interest rates are not_playing a major role according to pension experts . Shortly after Trumps announcement of import tariffs in April 2025 bond interest rates rose sharply but that increase has been virtually wiped out . So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value says Bas Werker professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar . Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON “ If you exchange US bonds for European bonds you are not_disposing of bonds. ” Selling ABPs deliberate policy i.e . selling or not_repurchasing therefore seems to play a major role . “ Trumps unpredictability and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and nonfinancial resilience ” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels . ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively . “ That is what our investment mix is aimed at ” said the spokesperson . Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies . US debt For decades the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world but rising government spending is increasing the national debt . This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts . High debt is not_a problem as long as enough countries investors and individuals are willing to hold dollars . Trumps import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries . Since his second term as president the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent . Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank the Fed to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell . This fall the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds . Danish pension funds This week it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds . These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights . A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trumps threat to take Greenland . “ This decision is the result of weak US public finances ” said Anders Schelde head of investments at the Danish teachers pension fund . According to him it is a matter of risk management . The money is now being invested in less risky investments . Like ABP the Danish teachers pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not_directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe . Nevertheless the two can not be viewed entirely separately “ Of course that doesnt make it any easier to take such a decision ” said Schelde . I thought this part was interesting ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . Refusing to comment as to why sounds like theyre planning to sell off more"

      "selftext": "[]( MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year If the glasses fail and he scraps them, Snapchat saves roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest, the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year If the glasses fail and he scraps them Snapchat saves roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing. “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSENT MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT_IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them Snapchat will save roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for . Meta ’ s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms unlike Snapchat ’ s which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers it ’ s not_just a status thing . “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

      "selftext": "As English is not my first language, I have used Gemini to help me. But you know what, see the positions first, cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read: So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on. We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**. If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the \"fat loss\" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match. Here is the DD. # 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees) The market punished this thing last year because they wanted \"just another weight loss drug.\" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.** * **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees \"substantial improvement\" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug **LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy** * **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut. # 2. The \"For Sale\" Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding. * **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout. * **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme). * **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade. # 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play) Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board. * **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive). * **Viking ($VKTX):** \\~$8B+ market cap. * Novo also got some company in this space for billions * **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.** It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded. # 4. The Catalyst & The Risk * **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring. * **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \\~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive. * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers. * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons. * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire. # Summary They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers). This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny. **TL;DR:** * **Ticker:** $ALT * **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start. * **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations. * **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first). * **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal. bonus - 21% SI Not financial advice, but this could 2x to 10x , who the hell knows, but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason.... Many people saying AI bots. Check my history, I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard. Now who comments on the threads, I can't control. Bonus - weight loss means bigger peepee Edit - if you guys made money take your profits. It's run harder than I thought, still keep skin in the game.",

      "selftext_processed": "As English is not_my first language I have used Gemini to help me . But you know what see the positions first cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99 % of you guys wont read So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on . We are talking about Altimmune $ ALT . If you ’ ve been watching the GLP1 space Lilly Novo you know the fat loss trade is crowded . But $ ALT just pivoted to the holy grail MASH liver disease Weight Loss . And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match . Here is the DD . 1 . The Data is absolute fire FDA Agrees The market punished this thing last year because they wanted just another weight loss drug . $ ALT gave them something better Pemvidutide . BTD CONFIRMED As of Jan 5 2026 the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation BTD for MASH . This is huge . It means the FDA sees substantial improvement over existing therapies . This is also means chances of approval are now over 75 % FDA wants this drug LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL only around 13 of applications gets accepted and it tells big Pharma FDA wants this drug come fucking buy The Kicker Unlike Madrigal ’ s drug Rezdiffra which just treats the liver $ ALT ’ s drug shreds fat too . Patients hit 7.5 % weight loss at 48 weeks on the high dose and the chart showed no plateau meaning they were still losing weight . It ’ s a twoforone special Fix the liver lose the gut . 2 . The For Sale Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part . Look at the CSuite changes . They arent building a 20year dynasty they are dressing the bride for a wedding . New CEO Jan 2026 Jerry Durso . Who is he He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals . He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma . He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout . New CFO Nov 2024 Greg Weaver . This guy was the CFO at Sirna sold to Merck and ILEX sold to Genzyme . Translation You dont hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade . 3 . Valuation is a Joke The Value Play Let ’ s look at the comps . This is why it ’ s the best value on the board . Madrigal $ MDGL MultiBillion market cap . Commercial stage but expensive . Viking $ VKTX $ 8B market cap . Novo also got some company in this space for billions Altimmune $ ALT $ 450M $ 550M Market Cap . It is trading at cash a handshake . If this gets even half the valuation of its peers it ’ s a multibagger . The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA . The ship is loaded . 4 . The Catalyst The Risk The Hype The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference Jan 2026 . Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring . The Risk The Bear Case Cash . They have $ 210M as of late 2025 . Phase 3 is expensive . Scenario A They dilute . Stock dips we cry then it recovers . Scenario B Partnership Nondilutive cash . Stock moons . Scenario C Buyout . We retire . Summary They have the Data BTD granted they have the Management literally hired guys who sell companies and they have the Market Cap insanely low compared to peers . This isnt a pure obesity play anymore its the leading MASH play that makes you skinny . TLDR Ticker $ ALT Catalyst FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Phase 3 start . Upside 35x to catch up to peer valuations . Risk Cash burnDilution unless they partnersell first . Prediction Jerry Durso didnt take this job to work a 95 . He took it to sign a deal . bonus 21 % SI Not_financial advice but this could 2x to 10x who the hell knows but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason .... Many people saying AI bots . Check my history I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard . Now who comments on the threads I cant control . Bonus weight loss means bigger peepee Edit if you guys made money take your profits . Its run harder than I thought still keep skin in the game ."

EPS for last quarter came in at $.15, significantly topping estiates of $.08. Revenue of $13.67 billion topped estimates of about $13.4 billion. The results for last quarter look solid. The problem is Q1 guidance, which is $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion. At the midpoint that’s below Wall Street’s estimate of $12.51 billion. Q1 EPS guidance is also poor.

      "selftext": "I’m looking to propose to my girlfriend of four years this year, and have put down two deposits for an engagement ring (one for the band, one for the diamond). I’m currently low on cash in my bank account to finish paying the rest of it off. I have a RH brokerage account that holds \\~20% VOO and the rest of it is individual stocks (TSM, WMT, RKLB, etc). I use this account to hold onto stocks long term. If I sell all of my VOO, I will have enough money to pay off the rest of the ring. I plan on getting back into S&P 500 exposure either through my job’s 401K plan or a Roth IRA. Or would it be better to hold VOO and sell some of the individual stocks I own? Please let me know what you guys think. Thank you! Edit: Want to clarify here since a lot of people are asking: the engagement ring is a lab grown diamond ring, only need $2,000 to pay off the rest of it, which is about how much I have in VOO. Thanks!",

Basically this trade involves the rotation out of U.S. risk assets and treasuries due to the decline of the rule of law, imperialist ambitions and a possible break with NATO and other allies. Especially gold and silver have lately seen incredible inflows due to the lack of issuer risk. Are there any ETFs ex-US or stocks you'd recommend in this environment?

Basically this trade involves the rotation out of U.S. risk assets and treasuries due to the decline of the rule of law imperialist ambitions and a possible break with NATO and other allies . Especially gold and silver have lately seen incredible inflows due to the lack of issuer risk . Are there any ETFs exUS or stocks youd recommend in this environment How are you hedging the decline of the western bloc"

      "selftext": "As of writing this post gold is \\~$4900/oz and platinum is \\~$2550/oz. Platinum is estimated to be 30x rarer than gold, why is it 1/2 the cost? Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. It has constant demand from central banks and will always be seen as the go to as a safe haven. There will always be a premium for it but 200% relative to platinum, a scarcer mineral, seems excessive. Silver I think is more comparable to platinum, it isn’t viewed in the same light as gold and doesn’t deserve the premium gold has. Yet silver has surged more than platinum, why? Perhaps it’s due to it being a cheaper alternative to gold but for every 1 oz of platinum mined there are 139 oz of silver mined. Based solely on that, silver is \\~$96, making platinum 26x more expensive. It surely has room to grow higher based only on scarcity. Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters. This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years. Solely on this, the supply constraints will push up prices. There’s also growth as it’s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs. The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it’s also used in manufacturing for various defence products. I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not even being met.

      "title": "Cavvy Energy is 7x-ing it's Sulphur Revenue This Year - Does the Market Know?",
      "selftext": "Cavvy Energy (CVVY.TO), a Canadian energy company, has been locked in a awful contract for years. This deal required 80% of their sulphur production to be sold at $6/mt. Compare that to the current market value of $260/mt, and you can see how awful this deal is. This has meant Cavvy received an average of $34/mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $260/mt they could've gotten. This changes this year. In November, they entered into a new contract, wherein 1/3 of their suplhur will be sold at $225/mt, 1/3 between $205-$250/mt, and 1/3 at full market value. Averaged out, this'd put the price they get at around $250/mt, or 7.3x what they got last quarter. Cavvy currently produces around 1,100 mt/d, but can expand that to 1,400 mt/d at peak periods. Averaged at 1200 mt/d, it means Cavvy currently receives around $14M a year from sulphur, but with the new deal would be getting around $100M a year (perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer, which the current $34/mt accounts for). Last year, Cavvy made around $30M a quarter in total NOI, across all areas of their business: already a significant increase from the year before. Accounting for the new suplhur pricing, they could be adding $20M per quarter to that number, or around +60% compared to last year, or a total $200M NOI compared to $120M (although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy, so it may not be indicative). They've been working down their debt every quarter, to currently $160M. The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster. Their net income per quarter often brushes break-even, or dips into the negatives somewhat, but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0. It seems like they'll break even for last year, which again, should put them in the green this year. At C$260M cap at the moment, it wouldn't take much profit to make them undervalued. The stock's already up 200% in the past year, and I think it could go higher. I will note that what values are in USD$ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry. The suplhur market price is in USD, but the market cap in C$, so numbers may vary a little.",

Compare that to the current market value of $ 260mt and you can see how awful this deal is . This has meant Cavvy received an average of $ 34mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $ 260mt they couldve gotten . This changes this year . In November they entered into a new contract wherein 13 of their suplhur will be sold at $ 225mt 13 between $ 205 $ 250mt and 13 at full market value . Averaged out thisd put the price they get at around $ 250mt or 7.3x what they got last quarter . Cavvy currently produces around 1100 mtd but can expand that to 1400 mtd at peak periods . Averaged at 1200 mtd it means Cavvy currently receives around $ 14M a year from sulphur but with the new deal would be getting around $ 100M a year perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer which the current $ 34mt accounts for . Last year Cavvy made around $ 30M a quarter in total NOI across all areas of their business already a significant increase from the year before . Accounting for the new suplhur pricing they could be adding $ 20M per quarter to that number or around 60 % compared to last year or a total $ 200M NOI compared to $ 120M although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy so it may not_be indicative .
