It's pretty safe to leave my money in but I'm wondering how stupid it will be to just throw that 100k into a stock for a bit like AVGO, Rocket Labs or some other stock i know will go up for a short bit. I feel like i could easily earn $20k+ in a short amount of time and then just put back the money in my SCHD. &nbsp; It would take me at least 10-15 years to get millions if I play the safe way but that also means no wife or kids and I'm 40 now. I prefer money over love and kids as it has more value to me cause I don't know if I'll have the energy to work or do things when I'm 50+. I just figure if I can get millions now, I can live off dividends and move on to my next goals.",

      "selftext": "New to investing...can't wrap my head around it. I get all this: I understand how to invest in ETFs I understand how risky it is to invest in single stocks but possibly more returns if you make smart decisions at the right time I understand compounding I have a 401k through my employers for now and that's it. I will be opening a HYSA, start my first few ETF stocks with $1k and split up percentages in a few of them, and keep putting money in both monthly. I understand once I have 6 months of emergency funds in the HYSA, I can stop putting money in there and put everything into stocks. What I don't get it is the taxing of all these... 1. The money getting compounded in my HYSA, is it getting taxed if I remove it? I'm putting in after tax money obviously so my thought is it shouldn't. 2. The money in my 401k - I know not to remove anything out of it until 59.5 yrs old and then it doesn't get taxed. If I want to remove from the 401k to use as a downpayment on a house, how much in the hole am I gonna be? 3. The brokerage account that is going to have the ETFs and if I ever get into to the single stocks...5 years later, I need to take out some money (say a downpayment on a house), then what happens? How much tax will I face? I don't understand all the investment channels on YouTube that talk about all these stocks and investing and show a 8 figure wealth but that money is all in the market or something. If a large purchase and they need access to cash, how do they get it?",

I get all this I understand how to invest in ETFs I understand how risky it is to invest in single stocks but possibly more returns if you make smart decisions at the right time I understand compounding I have a 401k through my employers for now and thats it . I will be opening a HYSA start my first few ETF stocks with $ 1k and split up percentages in a few of them and keep putting money in both monthly . I understand once I have 6 months of emergency funds in the HYSA I can stop putting money in there and put everything into stocks . What I dont get it is the taxing of all these ... 1 . The money getting compounded in my HYSA is it getting taxed if I remove it Im putting in after tax money obviously so my thought is it shouldnt . 2 . The money in my 401k I know not_to remove anything out of it until 59.5 yrs old and then it doesnt get taxed . If I want to remove from the 401k to use as a downpayment on a house how much in the hole am I gon na be 3 . The brokerage account that is going to have the ETFs and if I ever get into to the single stocks ... 5 years later I need to take out some money say a downpayment on a house then what happens How much tax will I face I dont understand all the investment channels on YouTube that talk about all these stocks and investing and show a 8 figure wealth but that money is all in the market or something . If a large purchase and they need access to cash how do they get it"

I have 3 stocks (NBIS, BMNR, and CRWV) that equate to about $35K in losses thus far, does it make sense to sell those off to TLH? Does it still make sense to TLH if I believe that 1 or 2 of those stocks will eventually rebound in 2026? **Scenario 1:** I dont do anything, I will pay capitals gains tax (37%) on $61K, which is around $22.5K. **Scenario 2:** I go ahead and do the TLH and now my gains are $26K and my tax liability is $9600. With Scenario 1, I would have effectively profited $38.5K. With Scenario 2, I would profit around $16,400. So what is the purpose of TLH if the profit is going to be considerably less?",

Scenario 2 I go ahead and do the TLH and now my gains are $ 26K and my tax liability is $ 9600 . With Scenario 1 I would have effectively profited $ 38.5K . With Scenario 2 I would profit around $ 16400 . So what is the purpose of TLH if the profit is going to be considerably less"

      "selftext": "Today is probably the biggest investing milestone of my life. After holding one core equity position for close to 7 years, I exited it fully and booked around ₹8.4 crore in realised profits in the Indian stock market. This was not trading, not luck, and not paper gains. I actually sold and exited. Basic numbers for context: Total invested between FY19 and FY22: around ₹62 lakh Total realised in FY25: about ₹9.05 crore Net profit: roughly ₹8.43 crore Holding period: \\~6.5 to 7 years Instrument: only cash equity Status: fully exited in FY25 I want to clarify one thing upfront this was not a YOLO bet and not a one-stock portfolio. Back in FY19–FY21, my portfolio roughly looked like this: Large caps \\~45% Mid-caps \\~30% Small caps \\~10% Mutual funds / index funds \\~10% Cash / liquid \\~5% The stock that eventually created most of the profit was initially less than 7% of my total equity portfolio. How it started I began buying this stock in FY18–FY19. At that time: Market sentiment was average to negative The company wasn’t popular or discussed much There was no multi bagger or social media hype My first investment was around ₹6–7 lakh. The idea was simple-own businesses that sit at the infrastructure level of long-term change, not short-term stories. Building conviction Between FY20 and FY22, I kept adding slowly during: The COVID crash Post-COVID uncertainty Inflation worries Rate hike fears By FY22, total investment reached around ₹60+ lakh. It had become my biggest single holding, but still only about 18–20% of my equity portfolio. For long periods, returns were flat. There were months where nothing moved and I genuinely wondered why so much capital was stuck here. What changed? Things changed fast in FY23–FY24. India’s capex cycle, digital adoption, and global outsourcing tailwinds came together, and the company executed well. Earnings improved and valuations followed. At that point: The stock grew from \\~20% to 35%+ of my equity portfolio Daily P&L swings were ₹20–30 lakh Yearly gains were more than what my entire portfolio used to make earlier I stopped adding at this stage because the position size was already large. Exit decision At the start of FY25, I set a simple rule for myself: If realised gains cross ₹8 crore, I exit completely. Reason was straightforward: Concentration risk had gone up a lot Capital protection became more important Personal priorities changed No stock deserves blind loyalty In Q1 FY25, when the stock hit new highs, I exited 100% of the position over multiple sessions. No leverage, no panic selling, normal market liquidity. These are realised gains, not screenshots or notional numbers. After exit Post exit, my portfolio is roughly: Large caps / index funds \\~50% Mid-caps \\~20% Debt / liquid \\~20% Cash \\~10% Focus now is protecting capital and steady compounding, not chasing another extreme outlier. What I learned Position sizing matters more than stock picking Most wealth is created very late in the journey Selling well is harder than buying Indian markets reward patience but punish greed Similar stories exist because good Indian companies create multiple winners. That doesn’t make them fake. This one just happens to be mine, and it’s fully realised in FY25. Happy investing.",

      "selftext_processed": "Today is probably the biggest investing milestone of my life . After holding one core equity position for close to 7 years I exited it fully and booked around ₹8.4 crore in realised profits in the Indian stock market . This was not_trading not_luck and not_paper gains . I actually sold and exited . Basic numbers for context Total invested between FY19 and FY22 around ₹62 lakh Total realised in FY25 about ₹9.05 crore Net profit roughly ₹8.43 crore Holding period 6.5 to 7 years Instrument only cash equity Status fully exited in FY25 I want to clarify one thing upfront this was not_a YOLO bet and not_a onestock portfolio . Back in FY19–FY21 my portfolio roughly looked like this Large caps 45 % Midcaps 30 % Small caps 10 % Mutual funds index funds 10 % Cash liquid 5 % The stock that eventually created most of the profit was initially less than 7 % of my total equity portfolio . How it started I began buying this stock in FY18–FY19 . At that time Market sentiment was average to negative The company wasn ’ t popular or discussed much There was no_multi bagger or social media hype My first investment was around ₹6–7 lakh . The idea was simpleown businesses that sit at the infrastructure level of longterm change not_shortterm stories . Building conviction Between FY20 and FY22 I kept adding slowly during The COVID crash PostCOVID uncertainty Inflation worries Rate hike fears By FY22 total investment reached around ₹60 lakh . It had become my biggest single holding but still only about 18–20 % of my equity portfolio . For long periods returns were flat . There were months where nothing_moved and I genuinely wondered why so much capital was stuck here . What changed Things changed fast in FY23–FY24 . India ’ s capex cycle digital adoption and global outsourcing tailwinds came together and the company executed well . Earnings improved and valuations followed . At that point The stock grew from 20 % to 35 % of my equity portfolio Daily PL swings were ₹20–30 lakh Yearly gains were more than what my entire portfolio used to make earlier I stopped adding at this stage because the position size was already large . Exit decision At the start of FY25 I set a simple rule for myself If realised gains cross ₹8 crore I exit completely . Reason was straightforward Concentration risk had gone up a lot Capital protection became more important Personal priorities changed No_stock deserves blind loyalty In Q1 FY25 when the stock hit new highs I exited 100 % of the position over multiple sessions . No_leverage no_panic selling normal market liquidity . These are realised gains not_screenshots or notional numbers . After exit Post exit my portfolio is roughly Large caps index funds 50 % Midcaps 20 % Debt liquid 20 % Cash 10 % Focus now is protecting capital and steady compounding not_chasing another extreme outlier . What I learned Position sizing matters more than stock picking Most wealth is created very late in the journey Selling well is harder than buying Indian markets reward patience but punish greed Similar stories exist because good Indian companies create multiple winners . That doesn ’ t make them fake . This one just happens to be mine and it ’ s fully realised in FY25 . Happy investing ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been going back to the basics of traditional investing, and it’s a reminder of how little the some ideas actually change, from Managing risk, spreading exposure, respecting the market rules, though No matter how tough the markets get, those principles tend to matter more than whatever the trend of the moment is. What has been changing is the conversation around the infrastructure, a lot of people are talking about how traditional markets might borrow from new systems, that is things like on chain settlement, tokenized assets, or easier digital access, without throwing the regulation out, though It’s less about replacing TradFi and more about small upgrades that could make existing products clearer, cheaper, or easier to move around. That’s why Bitget’s recent TradFi related announcement made me go deeply in thinking more about tradfi, Not because it feels like a big breakthrough, but because it fits this slow, experimental shift, It looks like another attempt to test how traditional structures and new tools can coexist, Whether it turns into something useful or fades quietly is still unknown, but it’s a sign that even conservative parts of finance are willing to try new angles now and then.",

      "selftext": "Micron's earnings report showed strong demand for memory chips, easing investor concerns about a potential slowdown in data center construction. Micron Technology's adjusted revenue for the first fiscal quarter was $13.64 billion, exceeding analysts' expectations of $12.95 billion; adjusted net profit was $5.482 billion, compared to $3.469 billion in the same period last year. The company projected second-quarter revenue of $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion, significantly higher than the market expectation of $14.3 billion. Morgan Stanley analysts stated that, besides Nvidia, this might be the largest upward revision of revenue and net profit guidance in the history of the US semiconductor industry. Key data at a glance: Not only did the first-quarter performance exceed expectations, but the second-quarter revenue guidance was even higher, at $18.7 billion ± $400 million, a full $4 billion more than the market estimate of $14.38 billion! This data is not isolated, but rather a \"charge signal\" for the full recovery of the memory chip industry.",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent, ByteDance Ltd., signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majority-owned by American investors >In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg, Chew said he was “pleased to share some great news” and said agreements with Oracle Corp., Silver Lake and MGX have been signed. Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22, 2026. >“Upon the closing, the US joint venture, built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security (USDS) organization, will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection, algorithm security, content moderation and software assurance,” Chew said in the memo. Meanwhile, “TikTok global’s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities, including e-commerce, advertising, and marketing,” he wrote. >The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September, which was pending approval from China. Chew’s memo does not mention China’s opinion on the transaction. It says 50% of the investors will be new, with Oracle, Silver Lake and MGX, an Abu Dhabi-based investment company, retaining 15% each; 30.1% will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance; and 19.9% will be retained by ByteDance. >After more than a year of negotiations, Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance’s popular video app to a consortium of investors. If finalized, the deal would remove a persistent issue in Beijing-Washington relations and signal progress in broader talks. But it would also deprive China’s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon. >ByteDance’s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok’s business. Under the the deal proposed by Washington, ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity, which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle, TikTok’s cloud partner. >Trump’s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know?: QuickTake >The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement, which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration. US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company, and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app’s recommendation algorithm. >Under the law, the initial deadline for the sell-or-ban rule was this past January, but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office, most recently pushing it into January 2026.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source TikTok Chief Executive Officer Shou Chew told employees that the social media company and its parent ByteDance Ltd. signed binding agreements to create a US joint venture majorityowned by American investors In an internal memo reviewed by Bloomberg Chew said he was “ pleased to share some great news ” and said agreements with Oracle Corp. Silver Lake and MGX have been signed . Chew gave a closing date of Jan. 22 2026 . “ Upon the closing the US joint venture built on the foundation of the current TikTok US Data Security USDS organization will operate as an independent entity with authority over US data protection algorithm security content moderation and software assurance ” Chew said in the memo . Meanwhile “ TikTok global ’ s U.S. entitieswill manage global product interoperability and certain commercial activities including ecommerce advertising and marketing ” he wrote . The memo outlined a deal that matched what the White House announced in September which was pending approval from China . Chew ’ s memo does not_mention China ’ s opinion on the transaction . It says 50 % of the investors will be new with Oracle Silver Lake and MGX an Abu Dhabibased investment company retaining 15 % each 30.1 % will be held by affiliates of certain existing investors of ByteDance and 19.9 % will be retained by ByteDance . After more than a year of negotiations Washington arranged a sale of the US arm of ByteDance ’ s popular video app to a consortium of investors . If finalized the deal would remove a persistent issue in BeijingWashington relations and signal progress in broader talks . But it would also deprive China ’ s most valuable private company of total control of an American social media phenomenon . ByteDance ’ s coveted algorithms are considered central to TikTok ’ s business . Under the the deal proposed by Washington ByteDance will license its AI recommendation technology to a newly created US TikTok entity which will use the existing algorithm to retrain a new system that is secured by Oracle TikTok ’ s cloud partner . Trump ’ s TikTok Deal With China — What Do We Know QuickTake The White House had dominated disclosures about the proposed arrangement which was mandated on national security grounds by a law signed last year under the Joe Biden administration . US officials have expressed concern that TikTok is owned by a Chinese company and are worried that Beijing could use the app to collect data about US citizens or push specific narratives to Americans via the app ’ s recommendation algorithm . Under the law the initial deadline for the sellorban rule was this past January but Trump has extended this deadline multiple times since reentering office most recently pushing it into January 2026 ."

First test is: how easily can I explain the business to a friend or family member and do they understand it? 2. Does the business have a moat and can I easily qualify/position it? 3. Do I truly believe that the moat is \"durable\" i.e., is it sustainable over the long-run? 4. If I were given \"X\" MUSD could I disrupt the business? (i.e., \"testing\" the moat) 5. What's the track record of the management team? 6. What does the barriers to entry for the industry look like? 7. Where is profit made in the industry - profitpool / value chain analysis 8. Does the sustainable competitive advantage of the firm derive from local or global markets? 9. Has anyone tried to enter the market and if so how did they do --> I'd love to see incumbents having tried to enter the industry but having failed 10. If I do a general search on the web what does people say about the firm - looking at customers perception; this does not work for all businesses 11. How exposed is it to macro factors? Is it a discretionary / nondiscretionary product 12. Where is the business in its life cycle and how is it positioned to utilize that position? 13. Does it generate ROIC > WACC at a persistent level?",

Do I truly believe that the moat is durable i.e . is it sustainable over the longrun 4 . If I were given X MUSD could I disrupt the business i.e . testing the moat 5 . Whats the track record of the management team 6 . What does the barriers to entry for the industry look like 7 . Where is profit made in the industry profitpool value chain analysis 8 . Does the sustainable competitive advantage of the firm derive from local or global markets 9 . Has anyone tried to enter the market and if so how did they do Id love to see incumbents having tried to enter the industry but having failed 10 . If I do a general search on the web what does people say about the firm looking at customers perception this does not_work for all businesses 11 . How exposed is it to macro factors Is it a discretionary nondiscretionary product 12 . Where is the business in its life cycle and how is it positioned to utilize that position 13 . Does it generate ROIC WACC at a persistent level"

      "selftext": "Trump Media & Technology Group surged a staggering 40% today, with the intraday rally clearly not the work of “normal capital.” Honestly, seeing this move, my first thought wasn't fundamentals it was whether that blond guy was back in the game personally “stoking the fire.” A single word from him can instantly make the stock price defy gravity. The question is: Is this 40% surge the start of a new rally, or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels? I'm a bit conflicted myself: On one hand, you can never underestimate the “madness” of this stock using traditional logic; On the other hand, chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “last one holding the bag.” So I'd love to hear your thoughts Do you see any worthwhile opportunities here? Is this a short term bet, an event driven play, or have you completely written off stocks like this?",

The question is Is this 40 % surge the start of a new rally or are old players looking for buyers at these high levels Im a bit conflicted myself On one hand you can never_underestimate the “ madness ” of this stock using traditional logic On the other hand chasing it at these levels easily turns you into the “ last one holding the bag. ” So Id love to hear your thoughts Do you see any worthwhile opportunities here Is this a short term bet an event driven play or have you completely written off stocks like this"

It’s not a price target. And it’s not even some kind of “explosive catalyst.” It was just this one line: NVDA will work with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to integrate an exploration platform connecting government, industry, and academia. If you’ve only been following NVDA for the past year, you’d probably think: “What does this have to do with the stock price?” But if you’ve held NVDA long enough, you know what really defines a company often isn’t in the headline. What is the DOE? It’s not there to fuel market hype. It oversees supercomputing, energy systems, materials science, nuclear research. When places like this choose a platform, they have a few traits: Slow Deliberate Once they adopt it, they rarely switch This isn’t just “selling GPUs” anymore. This is being woven into the foundational computing infrastructure of U.S. research and industry. Lately, I’ve seen way too much discussion about NVDA: “Isn’t the valuation too high?” “Is this a bubble?” “Should I trim my position?” Honestly, I’ve been through this before. 2017, 2020, 2023… people have said this every cycle. But when you look back, what has really held NVDA up isn’t sentiment, but the fact that “the world can’t do without it anymore.” Now it’s not just indispensable among cloud providers it’s becoming the default choice in government, research, and energy systems too. This isn’t the kind of news that makes the stock jump 10% tomorrow. This is the kind of news where: Five years from now, you’ll look back and realize the groundwork was already being laid today. Not saying you should buy. Not saying it won’t pull back. But as a long-term shareholder, one thing is becoming clearer to me: When a company starts getting embedded into national level systems, arguing about whether it’s “expensive” using ordinary tech stock logic… well, that feels like we’re not even on the same wavelength anymore. Just curious: How many people here have held NVDA for more than 3 years? What’s your first reaction when you see news like this?",

Certain LLMs have become very useful and even ubiquitous, while AI art has been controversial at best, and data centers are mounting concerns around their costs being deflected onto people who are unlucky enough to live near them, plus environmental concerns and their costs being hidden from capex. I am not saying that there is 100% a bubble but this does seem like very real evidence of one. Thoughts?",

OpenAI is not_profitable and companies that are branching into AI development dont have a profitable AI dept . The biggest financial movements in the last several months are the same couple companies passing large amounts of money back and forth for AI development AI itself as in Generative AI has been a mixed bag IMO . Certain LLMs have become very useful and even ubiquitous while AI art has been controversial at best and data centers are mounting concerns around their costs being deflected onto people who are unlucky enough to live near them plus environmental concerns and their costs being hidden from capex . I am not_saying that there is 100 % a bubble but this does seem like very real evidence of one . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "I have some super underwater covered calls and was thinking about what's the best way to get out of them. I'm not sure if I just thought of something useful or if there's flaws. Here's my example: I bought ABC stock for $10 forever ago. I sold covered calls super early at a $20 strike and just keep rolling them, but there's really not much value in rolling anymore because the stock is on a mega run and is now $200. If I donate the underlying to charity, I get to write off $200 (which avoids $190 in capital gains). At the same time, I can take that $20 covered (naked now after donating the underlying) call and close it for a huge loss. Would this effectively allow me to almost get like a double deduction out of it? I get away from having to pay capital gains which is almost the full amount given the run up, and then now I also get to claim a huge loss on the call? Is there anything wrong with this strategy other than I am not getting any money out of it - but that's okay I'm willing to donate to charity. This seems to be much more tax efficient for me than just donating directly... someone help me either validate this or tell me what's wrong with the plan. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "Many folks have made a fortune with Bitcoin, NVDA, PLTR etc. Those who have the ability to see with some clarity as to what will happen to these risky assets are very fortunate. People like me heavily rely on youtubers and reddit content to get a sense of how things are going for any of these risky assets, and what are the potential risks. BTC falling by 80% has happened quite a few times in the past. Stocks like AMZN have also fell like that in the past. At least, with stocks, you know that valuation is high so the potential downside is very high. But with Bitcoin, we don't even know what can trigger a massive selloff other than the well known speculations like MSTR dying etc. Following are the only few ways to manage risks. 1. Buying leaps. They will be extremely expensive for risky assets. So part of the unrealized gain will be lost in protecting the asset which is a bit ironic :) 2. Sell covered calls. Some of these stocks are well known to skyrocket within a short period of time. With covered calls, all the major upside will be lost if the stock really takes off like never before. A bunch of idiots on Youtube kept yelling \"overvalued ... overvalued\" when NVDA was at $400 presplit. I sold all my 100 shares fearing that it will crash like Cisco did around the year 2000. I bet the covered call sellers would also have regretted that move quite a bit. 3. Simply exit the position, or at least take some profit and continue with reduced risk. Sadly, a good chunk of upside will be lost if it indeed manages to go up in the \"long run.\" :) Stocks like GOOGL are relatively less risky but BTC, PLTR etc are like landmines. They can explode anytime when lady luck steps on it, and it is making me very nervous day by day. We cannot have the cake and eat it too. Something's gotta give. Nevertheless I wanted to pick your brain as to how you manage your risk if you are hedging your portfolio in some way. Would really appreciate it if you can share some ideas.",

      "selftext_processed": "Many folks have made a fortune with Bitcoin NVDA PLTR etc . Those who have the ability to see with some clarity as to what will happen to these risky assets are very fortunate . People like me heavily rely on youtubers and reddit content to get a sense of how things are going for any of these risky assets and what are the potential risks . BTC falling by 80 % has happened quite a few times in the past . Stocks like AMZN have also fell like that in the past . At least with stocks you know that valuation is high so the potential downside is very high . But with Bitcoin we dont even know what can trigger a massive selloff other than the well known speculations like MSTR dying etc . Following are the only few ways to manage risks . 1 . Buying leaps . They will be extremely expensive for risky assets . So part of the unrealized gain will be lost in protecting the asset which is a bit ironic 2 . Sell covered calls . Some of these stocks are well known to skyrocket within a short period of time . With covered calls all the major upside will be lost if the stock really takes off like never_before . A bunch of idiots on Youtube kept yelling overvalued ... overvalued when NVDA was at $ 400 presplit . I sold all my 100 shares fearing that it will crash like Cisco did around the year 2000 . I bet the covered call sellers would also have regretted that move quite a bit . 3 . Simply exit the position or at least take some profit and continue with reduced risk . Sadly a good chunk of upside will be lost if it indeed manages to go up in the long run . Stocks like GOOGL are relatively less risky but BTC PLTR etc are like landmines . They can explode anytime when lady luck steps on it and it is making me very nervous day by day . We can not have the cake and eat it too . Somethings got ta give . Nevertheless I wanted to pick your brain as to how you manage your risk if you are hedging your portfolio in some way . Would really appreciate it if you can share some ideas ."

      "selftext": "TSMC is reportedly set to begin mass production of its 2nm process by the end of this year. Capacity at its two existing fabs has been fully booked, prompting the company to build additional facilities. It plans to invest $28.6 billion to meet demand. Major clients include Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, MediaTek, and AMD, with Apple securing over half of the initial capacity. TSMC aims to increase monthly production to 100,000 wafers by the end of 2026. Morgan Stanley has also raised its target price, noting growth potential in revenue and margins for 2026, with gross margins projected to exceed 60%. Positives: Tight capacity and premium pricing for advanced nodes positively impact near-term revenue and pricing power; major clients queuing up confirms genuine demand. Risks: $28.6 billion in massive CapEx, extended delivery cycles, and long capital payback periods; significant risks if end-demand slows or inventory builds. Should one increase TSMC holdings now or wait for early 2026 order data?",

      "selftext": "Not trying to push a bull or bear narrative here just sharing how TSLA looks to me right now from a market + technical perspective. Price wise, TSLA is still holding near highs, but the structure feels very different compared to earlier runs. A few things that stand out: Clear overhead resistance Every push toward recent highs keeps getting sold into. Doesn’t feel like retail panic selling more like larger players trimming or hedging into strength. Strong looking support below (for now) There’s a pretty obvious high volume area underneath where buyers have stepped in multiple times. As long as that holds, this still looks more like high level consolidation than a full trend break. Volume isn’t convincing on bounces The rebounds lately feel more news driven than demand driven. Not seeing that clean, aggressive accumulation you’d want if this was about to rip higher. Because of that, this spot feels kind of uncomfortable for both sides: Chasing here feels late Shorting blindly feels risky as long as support holds Personally, I’m leaning light position / wait and see rather than pressing either direction. If it breaks down, it’ll probably be obvious. If it breaks out, I’d rather see confirmation than front-run it. Longer term, yeah everything still comes back to Robotaxi / FSD / AI narrative vs regulatory and execution risk. But short term, the tape feels like it’s asking a question, not giving an answer. So I’m genuinely curious: Do you see this as high level base building before another leg up? Or distribution after a big run? Or is TSLA basically a pure headline stock now where technicals don’t even matter? If you’re holding TSLA, how are you positioned right now adding, holding, trimming, or just watching? Interested to hear how people with different time horizons are thinking about this.",

Price wise TSLA is still holding near highs but the structure feels very different compared to earlier runs . A few things that stand out Clear overhead resistance Every push toward recent highs keeps getting sold into . Doesn ’ t feel like retail panic selling more like larger players trimming or hedging into strength . Strong looking support below for now There ’ s a pretty obvious high volume area underneath where buyers have stepped in multiple times . As long as that holds this still looks more like high level consolidation than a full trend break . Volume isn ’ t convincing on bounces The rebounds lately feel more news driven than demand driven . Not_seeing that clean aggressive accumulation you ’ d want if this was about to rip higher . Because of that this spot feels kind of uncomfortable for both sides Chasing here feels late Shorting blindly feels risky as long as support holds Personally I ’ m leaning light position wait and see rather than pressing either direction . If it breaks down it ’ ll probably be obvious . If it breaks out I ’ d rather see confirmation than frontrun it . Longer term yeah everything still comes back to Robotaxi FSD AI narrative vs regulatory and execution risk . But short term the tape feels like it ’ s asking a question not_giving an answer . So I ’ m genuinely curious Do you see this as high level base building before another leg up Or distribution after a big run Or is TSLA basically a pure headline stock now where technicals don ’ t even matter If you ’ re holding TSLA how are you positioned right now adding holding trimming or just watching Interested to hear how people with different time horizons are thinking about this ."

      "selftext": "Tesla has become one of the most controversial stocks on the market, but looking beyond the daily headlines, I still believe it possesses a strong long term growth trajectory. Admittedly, the automotive business faces pressures intense pricing competition, saturation in the Chinese market, and profit margins that are no longer what they once were. Yet the market often overemphasizes the vehicle segment while underestimating the new direction Tesla is pivoting toward. FSD capabilities are advancing slowly but substantially. While the timeline remains contentious, Tesla's data advantage is difficult to replicate. Even if autonomous driving achieves only incremental breakthroughs, its implied option value is significant. The Optimus project, though at an earlier stage, represents asymmetric upside potential not a factor already fully priced in by the market. Collectively, the value and potential embedded in these two technologies are limitless. I don't expect the stock price to rise in a straight line, and pullbacks along the way would be unsurprising. But when examining Tesla over a multi year cycle, I am currently more bullish than bearish especially compared to numerous AI concept stocks that have already priced in perfect expectations. Curious to hear your perspective on TSLA, Do you primarily view it as a traditional automaker, or as a platform with option value?",

Amid this upbeat market sentiment, how long will MU's rally fueled by its strong earnings report last? On the economic front, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% year over year in November, below the market forecast of 3.1% and moderating from September's 3.0% increase. However, markets may remain reluctant to advance significantly ahead of the central bank's policy decision today.

This is why many risk-on assets have been hit pretty hard - or so that's the narrative I'm hearing off X and other places on Reddit. What if this is only the first rate hike? Everyone says the market has now priced in a 75 bps rate hike - this would get Japan's yield to 1.25%. However, this is well below the US overnight fed rate of 3.5 to 3.75%. What would happen to the US stock market and other assets if Japan were to implement a series of 25 to 75 bps rate hikes over the next 2-3 years, bringing their interest rates to 3.5% to match what the current perceived \"neutral\" rate is?",

Now later 30 ’ s and have an annualized return of 29.5 % compared to an annualized return of 15.1 % with the SP500 . I have a portfolio of about 10 stocks mostly tech except 1 banking stock . I bought $ 10K or NVIDIA in 2018 which is obviously the big reason I have beat the SP 500 by double since 2016 . That being said I don ’ t pretend I can continue this trend and I have $ 125K or cash waiting to deploy . Should I just go ahead and lump sum it all into VTI and call it a day When I pick stocks I usually do $ 10K buy orders . All my purchases are long term buys . I don ’ t ever sell and don ’ t plan on it until wanting to retire ."

The core significance is singular: reducing the cost of migration from NVDA and CUDA. In the short term, CUDA remains the de facto standard, and NVDA's position is difficult to shake. But this marks the first time we've seen a major player attempt to challenge it at the software ecosystem level, rather than just developing proprietary chips. For investors, which interpretation do you favor? Is this a potential crack in NVDA's long term moat? Or is it merely a bargaining tool for GOOGL and META to drive down prices and diversify supply chains? Would this lead you to adjust your long term positions in NVDA, GOOGL, or META?",

      "selftext": "I’m 18, UK based. Just took control of a £50k+ portfolio I built from savings and side hustles (flipping golf clubs, designer stuff, bit of luck). It’s been with the same firm my parents use. They’re about wealth preservation, not growth. Best year I got \\~16% while the S&P 500 did \\~25%. Fees are 1% + 0.5% platform. I don’t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me, which feels off. My aim is long term: save hard, compound, hit my financial goal at 45. With steady contributions and \\~7.5% returns after fees, it’s doable. Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive. Options: * 80% S&P 500 / 20% Nasdaq (higher growth, higher risk) * 70% S&P 500 / 30% global index + a few stocks (more diversified, less tech heavy) I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out. So: * Is all‑in S&P realistic for a UK investor long term? * Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify? * Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds? Not after hype, just grounded experiences. Cheers.",

I don ’ t even meet their usual client threshold but they still want to keep me which feels off . My aim is long term save hard compound hit my financial goal at 45 . With steady contributions and 7.5 % returns after fees it ’ s doable . Thinking of pulling it all out and going DIY passive . Options 80 % SP 500 20 % Nasdaq higher growth higher risk 70 % SP 500 30 % global index a few stocks more diversified less tech heavy I know people talk about an AI bubble but at my age I think I can ride it out . So Is all‑in SP realistic for a UK investor long term Is Nasdaq worth the risk or better to diversify Any regrets from leaving wealth managers and going DIY index funds Not_after hype just grounded experiences .

      "selftext": "The latest Reuters report shows markets climbing as inflation data finally comes in \"cool,\" with Micron leading a massive tech rally. But looking past the green tickers, there’s a very human story here: 1 - The Pivot to Relief: For weeks, the sentiment was dominated by fear of a recession and high interest rates. Now, one \"good\" data point has the algorithms and the bulls acting like the path is perfectly clear again. 2 - The Micron Factor: Micron’s surge is being treated as the \"all clear\" for the tech sector. It’s fascinating how we pin our entire outlook for the global economy on the earnings of one semiconductor company. 3 - The \"Imperfect\" Truth: Inflation is easing, but the cost of living for actual humans is still at an all-time high. There is a widening gap between the \"perfect\" stock market gains and the \"imperfect\" reality of the average person’s wallet. The Human Question: Does this rally feel like a genuine recovery to you, or are we just caught in a cycle of reacting to the \"least bad\" news? Is anyone else nervous that we’re getting too comfortable with these sudden swings? Source -",

      "selftext": "Etsy has just announced a new $750 million share repurchase program, in addition to the \\~$200 million still available from the previous program. In total, the company now has close to $1 billion in potential buyback capacity over the coming quarters. The stock is becoming increasingly interesting, and I would have even liked to see it added in the future to Bitget’s tokenized stocks list with TSLA, QQQ, NVIDA for easier access. Here’s a breakdown of what this implies: # 1. What is a share repurchase? A company buys back its own shares on the market. This reduces the number of shares outstanding, which can mechanically improve EPS and support the stock price, even if operating results remain stable. # 2. Positive points highlighted by Etsy The outgoing CEO, Josh Silverman, states that he sees “significant value” in the stock and expresses confidence in the growth strategy led by the future CEO, Kruti Patel Goyal (who will take office on January 1, 2026). Etsy had around $1.6 billion in cash at the end of the last quarter, allowing these buybacks without sacrificing strategic investments (Etsy + Depop). The program is flexible, with no expiration date, and can be adjusted or stopped at any time. # 3. Risks and limitations Buybacks do not create intrinsic value if growth slows down (competitive pressure from Amazon, Shein, Temu, etc.). The stock has already shown strong volatility, with a significant correction after the post-COVID peak. The cash used for buybacks could also be allocated to acquisitions, R&D, or balance sheet strengthening, even though Etsy does not carry significant debt. Personally i thin It feels like the market is still partially underestimating Etsy: the platform maintains a strong niche (handmade, vintage), Depop targets Gen Z, and the new leadership seems ready to accelerate growth initiatives. A buyback program of this scale, potentially 15–20% of the current market cap, suggests that the board views the stock as undervalued. For now, the market reaction remains modest (+2.2% in premarket). Do you see Etsy as an undervalued long-term opportunity or more as a value trap? Are you tracking the stock or already positioned?

      "selftext": "Been refining my DCF process and wanted to share thoughts on terminal value assumptions because I think most retail investors get this part completely wrong. Using perpetual growth rates that are too optimistic obviously inflates intrinsic value calculations. For something like Dollar General right now with margin compression and Walmart competition, I'm using 1.5% terminal growth even though consensus would say 2.5%. Stock looks interesting around $85 but my DCF keeps spitting out fair value closer to $78 with realistic margin assumptions. Running models through valuesense has been helpful for sanity checking inputs against historical data. A 50 basis point difference in WACC completely changes whether something screens as undervalued or not. For retailers specifically, digging into same store sales trends before assuming growth normalization is essential. Companies that look cheapest on P/E often have the most questionable growth assumptions baked in.",

Using perpetual growth rates that are too optimistic obviously inflates intrinsic value calculations . For something like Dollar General right now with margin compression and Walmart competition Im using 1.5 % terminal growth even though consensus would say 2.5 % . Stock looks interesting around $ 85 but my DCF keeps spitting out fair value closer to $ 78 with realistic margin assumptions . Running models through valuesense has been helpful for sanity checking inputs against historical data . A 50 basis point difference in WACC completely changes whether something screens as undervalued or not_For retailers specifically digging into same store sales trends before assuming growth normalization is essential . Companies that look cheapest on PE often have the most questionable growth assumptions baked in ."

      "selftext": "What is the difference between a Bitcoin balance and a traditional financial balance, such as a bank account or a commodity or stock broker’s account? A financial balance is a number that represents someone’s obligation, and by fulfilling that obligation, the holder of the balance realizes an economic benefit. Bitcoin was introduced and later promoted as a payment system, electronic cash, suggesting that the numbers it displays are some kind of alternative to bank account balances. But they are not. Bitcoin balances lack an underlying obligation, and holders can extract nothing from them. This becomes obvious when we examine how actual financial balances deliver benefits to their holders. The balance in a stock broker’s account represents the company’s obligation. When the company distributes profits, conducts a share buyback, or liquidates its operations, it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance. The balance in a commodity broker’s account represents the obligation of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder. That obligation involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value, depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract. The balance in a bank account represents the bank’s obligation toward the balance holder and, at the same time, the obligation of the bank’s debtor toward the bank. This balance arises when a bank (commercial or central) approves a loan to an individual, company, or state. Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor, services, and goods. Because they are obligated to repay the loan, they must ultimately return goods, labor, and services to the balance holders, while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance. If the loan is not repaid, the bank seizes the debtor’s real estate, equipment, or vehicles and sell them at auction to balance holders. Thus, bank balance holders realize tangible benefits (goods, labor, services, tax relief, and physical assets) through the fulfillment of underlying obligations. In Bitcoin, however, there is no obligation that can be fulfilled. The system merely issues numbers and verifies which number belongs to which user in a distributed digital database (the blockchain). Yet people have accepted the narrative of Bitcoin being an alternative to bank money, leading to an economic absurdity: they give up money that delivers tangible benefits in exchange for something that delivers none. In the long run, this must collapse, because no rational person would accept such an irrational deal indefinitely. The fact that Bitcoin is advertised as decentralized, scarce, secure from theft, and fast changes nothing, because its balances still do not provide future economic benefits like traditional financial balances do. When the current market mania subsides, those who still hold Bitcoin will be in serious trouble.",

Bitcoin was introduced and later promoted as a payment system electronic cash suggesting that the numbers it displays are some kind of alternative to bank account balances . But they are not_Bitcoin balances lack an underlying obligation and holders can extract nothing_from them . This becomes obvious when we examine how actual financial balances deliver benefits to their holders . The balance in a stock broker ’ s account represents the company ’ s obligation . When the company distributes profits conducts a share buyback or liquidates its operations it is obligated to make payments to the holders of that balance . The balance in a commodity broker ’ s account represents the obligation of the broker or intermediary institution toward the balance holder . That obligation involves enabling delivery of the contracted commodity or executing a cash payment equivalent to its value depending on the trading conditions and the type of contract . The balance in a bank account represents the bank ’ s obligation toward the balance holder and at the same time the obligation of the bank ’ s debtor toward the bank . This balance arises when a bank commercial or central approves a loan to an individual company or state . Debtors use this balance in the market to obtain labor services and goods . Because they are obligated to repay the loan they must ultimately return goods labor and services to the balance holders while the state allows taxes to be paid using this balance . If the loan is not_repaid the bank seizes the debtor ’ s real estate equipment or vehicles and sell them at auction to balance holders . Thus bank balance holders realize tangible benefits goods labor services tax relief and physical assets through the fulfillment of underlying obligations . In Bitcoin however there is no_obligation that can be fulfilled . The system merely issues numbers and verifies which number belongs to which user in a distributed digital database the blockchain . Yet people have accepted the narrative of Bitcoin being an alternative to bank money leading to an economic absurdity they give up money that delivers tangible benefits in exchange for something that delivers none . In the long run this must collapse because no_rational person would accept such an irrational deal indefinitely . The fact that Bitcoin is advertised as decentralized scarce secure from theft and fast changes nothing_because its balances still do not_provide future economic benefits like traditional financial balances do . When the current market mania subsides those who still hold Bitcoin will be in serious trouble ."

      "title": "Not overreacting to the NVDA insider sale",
      "selftext": "Nvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250,000 shares around $177 for roughly $44M. These were shares he’s held for decades, and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust, so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative. (News source if you’re interested: Nvidia Executives Sell Over $41 Million in Stock)For me, the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart. NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $177 to $180 area is the near term pivot. That’s roughly where the sale happened, and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately. If NVDA can reclaim $180 and stay above it for a few closes, it’s basically the market saying it does not care about the insider headline.On the downside, I’m watching $169 to $171 as first support. If that breaks cleanly, the next likely stop is the mid $160s, around $165 to $160. Below that, you’re probably looking at the low $150s, and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative. This is also why I’m not overreacting to the insider sale by itself. Big, long held positions get trimmed all the time. Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals, it’s not enough for me to call a top.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia director Harvey Jones sold about 250000 shares around $ 177 for roughly $ 44M . These were shares he ’ s held for decades and he still controls over 7M shares through a trust so I read this as long term trimming more than a confidence signal turning negative . News source if you ’ re interested Nvidia Executives Sell Over $ 41 Million in StockFor me the headline only matters if it lines up with the chart . NVDA is in a pretty defined zone and the $ 177 to $ 180 area is the near term pivot . That ’ s roughly where the sale happened and it has also been a tough area for the stock to push through lately . If NVDA can reclaim $ 180 and stay above it for a few closes it ’ s basically the market saying it does not_care about the insider headline.On the downside I ’ m watching $ 169 to $ 171 as first support . If that breaks cleanly the next likely stop is the mid $ 160s around $ 165 to $ 160 . Below that you ’ re probably looking at the low $ 150s and that usually needs a broader market wobble or a real shift in the AI narrative . This is also why I ’ m not_overreacting to the insider sale by itself . Big long held positions get trimmed all the time . Without a real break in price or a clear change in demand signals it ’ s not_enough for me to call a top ."

      "selftext": "Heavy post ahead!! There are some signs that we could be near the peak. My worries are growing -today was a huge warning, right after Friday, and we still have not yet seen a serious drop be priced in. Meaning, it's not unlikely the small haha down days may be just that - small.. They differ from the \"little bad news\" issues like Israel which quickly closed up, almost too fast. And that pattern became consistent after each episode. Up until now, it's been the same :sometimes seeing it on the daily progress, but don't be too greedy as the market has been prone to V bounce type rallies over and over again... We had been in that sort of \"market regeme\" for a while that may be shifting. Examining the market daily structure indicates a strong possibility, at least higher than average, of a lower high after a main high (see my attached nadsaq chart) we do not know if a massive tail sits below us, but if there is, it could pay heavily asymmetrically. Meaning like $10,000 may protect you from half a million in downside risk or more. But we don't need to nail each day. This is the opposite feel of how the market behaved post iran Israel, where we had no \"\" regime change \" so we overall could conclude the tape kept grinding higher in general. This chart was so similar to post covid and post tariffs and now, but it's like we could be at another inflection point. Much higher than the market believes. 1) debt default protection costs are rising , data centers being delayed. Capex is huge without a clear cut plan. Oracle literally may go bankrupt because if this. Banking risks and credit risks and products are directly exposed to Ai. The next wave of Ai will be MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE and require a Lot more hardware Than prior levels. I think a good analogy here with the circular deals are to fiber and communications in dot com bubble. The problem now, is if things go awry, we have the potential mix of a financial crisis aspect and Ai together. 2) this is arbitrary but I argue valid. Bitcoin surpassed 100k,is now well below thst (kind of like max pain for holders) while just now, some wealth advisors got the green light to sell it. That's a bit silly, as it's 1/10 its price when it really started catching On (let's say that's $10k) the technicals are poor, and when btc falls it pulls down risk assets. Aswath damordan discussed this on cnbc, but said he does own five of the seven mag 7 stocks. 3) ceos sounding extremely defensive. Recent interviews with Lisa su and Sam Altman really hit me as off. I respect Lisa greatly, but her tone was so defensive on a Bloomberg interview. 4) market technicals leading up to now. You can see this on the daily charts, as well as futures overnight. Sometimes, we're getting some insanely rapid, down moves. Sometimes very fast down moves at open as well. You yewterday Tues ended with a massive rally into the close thet kind of quickly... Fell apart like a bear market rally. I know there is also a key interest rate decision by the BOJ, which could throw a lot into the mix which few are actually reacting to PRIOR to the event when the tape still doesn't feel off. I'm feeling no reaction in the vix or tape yet and this leads me to one conclusion. Humans, as a species are extremely reactive, not extremely proactive. Think tsunami in Asia, earthquake sensors, we've known from history they've had huge quakes every hundred - 300 yesrs, and the last one being in the early - mid 1800s and we know this from history records. Meaning that if I genuinelly feel there's something off (sometimes I have, sometimes I briefly thought so but hadn't yet been able to confirm) like during the beginning of covid, this eerie feeling in the air - the market hadn't yet priced in the covid risks. I've been wrong so many times, but if bet equally each time it would've been net profitable :this has the exact same vibes I had prior to covid when David tepper was on the air saying he believes markets hadn't priced in this risk at all and himself was begging on a vix expansion two months after the virus. That would've been extremely profitable - tail risks.. Now Dr Burry has joined up on x too, if you want to look for his posts too.",

      "selftext_processed": "Heavy post ahead There are some signs that we could be near the peak . My worries are growing today was a huge warning right after Friday and we still have not_yet seen a serious drop be priced in . Meaning its not_unlikely the small haha down days may be just that small .. They differ from the little bad news issues like Israel which quickly closed up almost too fast . And that pattern became consistent after each episode . Up until now its been the same sometimes seeing it on the daily progress but dont be too greedy as the market has been prone to V bounce type rallies over and over again ... We had been in that sort of market regeme for a while that may be shifting . Examining the market daily structure indicates a strong possibility at least higher than average of a lower high after a main high see my attached nadsaq chart we do not_know if a massive tail sits below us but if there is it could pay heavily asymmetrically . Meaning like $ 10000 may protect you from half a million in downside risk or more . But we dont need to nail each day . This is the opposite feel of how the market behaved post iran Israel where we had no_ regime change so we overall could conclude the tape kept grinding higher in general . This chart was so similar to post covid and post tariffs and now but its like we could be at another inflection point . Much higher than the market believes . 1 debt default protection costs are rising data centers being delayed . Capex is huge without a clear cut plan . Oracle literally may go bankrupt because if this . Banking risks and credit risks and products are directly exposed to Ai . The next wave of Ai will be MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE and require a Lot more hardware Than prior levels . I think a good analogy here with the circular deals are to fiber and communications in dot com bubble . The problem now is if things go awry we have the potential mix of a financial crisis aspect and Ai together . 2 this is arbitrary but I argue valid . Bitcoin surpassed 100kis now well below thst kind of like max pain for holders while just now some wealth advisors got the green light to sell it . Thats a bit silly as its 110 its price when it really started catching On lets say thats $ 10k the technicals are poor and when btc falls it pulls down risk assets . Aswath damordan discussed this on cnbc but said he does own five of the seven mag 7 stocks . 3 ceos sounding extremely defensive . Recent interviews with Lisa su and Sam Altman really hit me as off . I respect Lisa greatly but her tone was so defensive on a Bloomberg interview . 4 market technicals leading up to now . You can see this on the daily charts as well as futures overnight . Sometimes were getting some insanely rapid down moves . Sometimes very fast down moves at open as well . You yewterday Tues ended with a massive rally into the close thet kind of quickly ... Fell apart like a bear market rally . I know there is also a key interest rate decision by the BOJ which could throw a lot into the mix which few are actually reacting to PRIOR to the event when the tape still doesnt feel off . Im feeling no_reaction in the vix or tape yet and this leads me to one conclusion . Humans as a species are extremely reactive not_extremely proactive . Think tsunami in Asia earthquake sensors weve known from history theyve had huge quakes every hundred 300 yesrs and the last one being in the early mid 1800s and we know this from history records . Meaning that if I genuinelly feel theres something off sometimes I have sometimes I briefly thought so but hadnt yet been able to confirm like during the beginning of covid this eerie feeling in the air the market hadnt yet priced in the covid risks . Ive been wrong so many times but if bet equally each time it wouldve been net profitable this has the exact same vibes I had prior to covid when David tepper was on the air saying he believes markets hadnt priced in this risk at all and himself was begging on a vix expansion two months after the virus . That wouldve been extremely profitable tail risks .. Now Dr Burry has joined up on x too if you want to look for his posts too ."

      "selftext": "I'm not going to lie, I'm a little uneasy about this market. P/E ratio is high. Unemployment rate is rising. Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4. High beta stocks have gotten demolished. Buffet's cash pile is at an ATH. Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify. The S&P has returned over 20% two years in a row followed by \\~15% so far in '25. There's concerns over Oracle's debt, OpenAI making commitments they can't keep, circular deals, many people even believe we're in a full on bubble. Anyway, I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash. 1. There have only been four years since 1938 where the S&P 500 total return was -18% or worse. 1974, 2002, 2008, and 2022. So 4/87 years. Yes, 18% is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18%. But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year, you only lost 18% or more over the next 12 months 4.6% of the time. 2. The S&P 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995. It was above 1.6 in 2016. Above 1.5 in 2004. And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s. It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed. 3. The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times. Some notable stretches. 2009-2017. 1991-1999. 1982-1989. 1947-1952. So just because we've had three years of strong gains doesn't mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down. 4. The trailing P/E of the S&P 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates. Namely Nvidia, which has a 42x trailing P/E but a 22.5x forward P/E. Historically, the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 3-4% per year. I'm not saying there aren't good reasons to be bearish. I'm not saying that 2026 is going to be a great year. I'm not even saying that you shouldn't reduce risk or that going to cash won't be the right move in hindsight. I'm just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have. Earnings growth has been strong, AI could really improve GDP over the next 5-10 years, margins have been steadily increasing for a long time, and interest rates are coming down. Sources: [ [",

      "selftext_processed": "Im not_going to lie Im a little uneasy about this market . PE ratio is high . Unemployment rate is rising . Stocks have been pretty weak in Q4 . High beta stocks have gotten demolished . Buffets cash pile is at an ATH . Aswath Damodaran is suggesting investors buy collectibles to diversify . The SP has returned over 20 % two years in a row followed by 15 % so far in 25 . Theres concerns over Oracles debt OpenAI making commitments they cant keep circular deals many people even believe were in a full on bubble . Anyway I just wanted to point out some data that may make you rethink selling out of your stocks and going to cash . 1 . There have only been four years since 1938 where the SP 500 total return was 18 % or worse . 1974 2002 2008 and 2022 . So 487 years . Yes 18 % is somewhat cherry picked and of course cumulative peak to trough drawdowns have been much worse than 18 % . But if you bought on the close of the last day of the trading year you only lost 18 % or more over the next 12 months 4.6 % of the time . 2 . The SP 500 PEG ratio is currently 1.2 which is roughly about average since 1995 . It was above 1.6 in 2016 . Above 1.5 in 2004 . And above 1.4 for much of the 2010s . It even got to 2.0 in 2023 but quickly reversed . 3 . The stock market has gone many years without a red total return year several times . Some notable stretches . 20092017 . 19911999 . 19821989 . 19471952 . So just because weve had three years of strong gains doesnt mean the bull market has to end here and come crashing down . 4 . The trailing PE of the SP 500 is being obfuscated by a few highly weighted stocks with abnormal growth rates . Namely Nvidia which has a 42x trailing PE but a 22.5x forward PE . Historically the largest stocks in the market usually grew at 34 % per year . Im not_saying there arent good reasons to be bearish . Im not_saying that 2026 is going to be a great year . Im not_even saying that you shouldnt reduce risk or that going to cash wont be the right move in hindsight . Im just trying to provide some balance to the current uneasy feeling many of us have . Earnings growth has been strong AI could really improve GDP over the next 510 years margins have been steadily increasing for a long time and interest rates are coming down . Sources"

Even on a bad day at rock bottom prices the total value of the ore depost exceeds $30 per share or even extracted with massive overhead costs is worth $20 plus.

But zinc is only a minor piece in the 17 rare earth elements that make up its ore deposits . From what I understand there is a 10 % of total stock in a short position coming due in a day . Even on a bad day at rock bottom prices the total value of the ore depost exceeds $ 30 per share or even extracted with massive overhead costs is worth $ 20 plus . Dont know if anyone is up to ruin a persons day well there you go"

      "selftext": "As we near the end of 2025, I’ve been thinking a lot about how this year has played out for me as an investor. Between the ups and downs of the AI hype cycle, the volatility in crypto, and the broader market swings, I’ve had to adjust my strategy more than once. If I had to pick one lesson that stood out, it would be this: I really underestimated the importance of cash management and balanced allocation. There were times I was too aggressive or too concentrated, and it hurt. Looking back, I wish I had focused more on building a portfolio that is steady over the long term but flexible enough to adapt when needed. Curious to hear from others. What was the most important lesson you learned this year, whether it’s about strategy, mindset, or a specific event that changed your thinking?",

      "title": "POET: The Photonic Solution to the SSD & RAM Shortage",
      "selftext": "We're all fully aware of what's going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD. [Kingston]( sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246% since early 2025 and says RAM/SSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down. [SK Hynix]( is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028, even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory. NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out, with double-digit price hikes locked in. On top of this, hyperscalers are only getting about [70% of the server DRAM they order]( even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50% in a single quarter. Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr. Evil prebooking [40% of the world's DRAM]( wafers with money that has yet to be seen. I say all this to say, HBM/DRAM/flash has become the new oil for AI, and everyone is fighting over the same barrels. What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn’t just how much memory you can buy, it’s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have, and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs, DRAM pools, and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce. In light of the RAM/SSD shortage, this has become a conversation about **finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands** This is where POET’s photonic engines come in: they don’t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD, but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway, letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBM/DRAM/flash. **So POET has two main products:** [The Optical Interposer]( \\- think of this as an “optical motherboard tile/chiplet.” [Starlight]( \\- an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light. Today’s optics usually look like this: * You’ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “gold box.” * Inside that box: lasers, modulators, drivers, receivers, lenses, fiber alignment, etc. * Every module is handheld, robot aligned, and tuned. Slow, expensive, power-hungry. POET’s interposer basically says fuck the gold box * They take silicon and III-V lasers and build everything into a flat wafer-scale platform. * Instead of doing micron-level alignment one module at a time, they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pick-and-place tools. * Fibers line up passively, so there's really no heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved * The parts on the interposer are configureable, so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer. think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it. To visualize, the interposer sits between the hot compute chips (GPUs/ASICs/NPUs) and the outside world (network, memory pools, storage) and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths. **Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer.** * Instead of putting hot, fragile lasers on the GPU/package, they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module. * That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute. **The benefits are:** * Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters (GB200, H100, etc.). * One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers. * Better reliability, easier maintenance, and lower $/bit because you share the light source across multiple links. **So together these two components work like this:** Starlight = shared light source Interposer = cheap, configurable, mass-produced optical engine tile that is easily scalable. This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product, as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer **So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution?** Most of the big incumbents (Broadcom, Coherent, Lumentum, etc.) are still: * Shipping discrete pluggable modules (400G/800G, etc.). * Using a lot of active alignment and labor-intensive packaging. * Typically putting lasers inside every module, which: * Wastes power * Adds heat right where you don’t want it * Doesn’t scale nicely to 1.6T / 3.2T and giant AI fabrics. **POET’s edge vs “generic” silicon photonics:** * Wafer-scale, passive alignment which lowers capex, lowers assembly cost, and is easier to ramp volume. * Allows hybrid integration: can mix and match best-of-breed lasers with silicon in one platform. * Remote lasers (Starlight) which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package. And if you're wondering if any of this technology has even been validated, look no further than Marvell Technologies, [who purchased one of POET's largest customers]( Celestial AI, for up to $5+ billion. Marvell's main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric, an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POET's Optical Interposer and uses POET’s Starlight as a remote laser source. In other words, a serious, blue-chip semi company and at least one hyperscaler ([AWS](#google_vignette)) have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it’s real enough to bet billions and multi-year roadmaps on. You don’t build a next-gen AI fabric around external lasers and wafer-scale photonics if you’re not confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams, BER targets, thermal budgets, and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale. The Marvell/Celestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying: “Yes, this class of photonic solution is how we’re going to attack the I/O wall.” Also, Celestial AI's CEO, [David Lazovsky]( was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAM/SSD shortage? POET obviously doesn’t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD, so the way they solve the shortage is indirect, but very real: they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own. Right now, hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation. They’re paying insane prices for HBM, DRAM, and enterprise SSDs, but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded. You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM, servers with their own DRAM, storage boxes full of flash, and the copper between them can’t move data fast enough. So to keep latency acceptable, the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place, sharding models, caching datasets on every node, and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn’t become a brick wall. That’s fine when RAM is cheap. It’s a killer when HBM/DRAM/flash prices are up 200% over the last month. On the power side, POET’s own FAQ for their 800G/1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators, wirebonds, and gearbox/DSP overhead, they can cut about **6–8 watts of power per module** versus conventional approaches at these speeds. Six to eight watts doesn’t sound like much until you remember you’re not deploying one module, you’re deploying thousands. At 10,000 modules across a big AI cluster, that’s **60–80 kW of power and cooling you’re not wasting just on the optics layer.** That “freed” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rack/power envelope. Then there’s cost. In their Starlight FAQ, POET flat-out says that for Celestial AI, the Starlight external light source is expected to be **up to 75% cheaper than comparable light sources on the market**, thanks to the Optical Interposer’s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly. Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory, which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource. There’s also a quiet supply angle baked in: their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way, and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “dramatic capacity increase” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers. In other words, they’re not just stretching HBM/DRAM/SSD; they’re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device. **Put that together in plain English: a single POET-based engine gives you terabit-class bandwidth in a tiny footprint, saves you several watts per port at 800G/1.6T, cuts your light source cost by as much as three-quarters, and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser. That’s what makes it a lever against the memory/SSD shortages. this results in:** * **GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on I/O.** * **You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency.** * **You can justify architecting shared memory pools and far-flash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable.** So in a world where HBM/DRAM/SSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance, POET’s pitch is basically: “Let us give you 1.6 Tbps-class optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash light-source cost by up to 75%, so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have.” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSD/RAM. **TL;DR** AI has turned HBM/DRAM/flash into the new oil. Prices are ripping, supply is pre-sold years out, and hyperscalers still can’t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAM/SSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs, DRAM pools, and storage. POET attacks that bottleneck: its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “gold box” optics with a wafer-scale, Lego-style optical tile, and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm, making high-bandwidth links cheaper, cooler, and easier to scale. That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabit-class bandwidth, cut power and light-source cost, and reduce stranded/duplicated data, so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBM/DRAM/SSD instead of just brute-forcing with more hardware. In a world where memory is scarce and pre-booked, POET doesn’t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte, and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the big-cap validation that this external-laser, photonic-fabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed. **Position:**",

      "selftext_processed": "Were all fully aware of whats going on with the supply chain shortages on RAM and SSD . Kingston sent out a warning stating that NAND costs are up 246 % since early 2025 and says RAMSSD prices are likely to keep rising through 2026 rather than come back down . SK Hynix is telling investors that the global memory shortage could drag on until 2028 even as they and Samsung print multi year high profits on AI memory . NAND suppliers are already reporting that their 2026 enterprise SSD allocations are basically sold out with doubledigit price hikes locked in . On top of this hyperscalers are only getting about 70 % of the server DRAM they order even after accepting contract price increases of up to 50 % in a single quarter . Then you got Sam Altman doing his best impression of Dr . Evil prebooking 40 % of the worlds DRAM wafers with money that has yet to be seen . I say all this to say HBMDRAMflash has become the new oil for AI and everyone is fighting over the same barrels . What I have come to notice is that real choke point isn ’ t just how much memory you can buy it ’ s how efficiently you can use the memory you already have and how fast you can shove bits between GPUs DRAM pools and SSDs without the copper plumbing melting down and draining power grids of every last drop of electricity they can possibly produce . In light of the RAMSSD shortage this has become a conversation about finding solutions that can maximize the compute potential of the currently existing infrastructure to meet current AI demands This is where POET ’ s photonic engines come in they don ’ t manufacture a single RAM chip or SSD but they act like adding extra lanes to the AI data highway letting data centers squeeze more training and inference out of every scarce byte of HBMDRAMflash . So POET has two main products The Optical Interposer think of this as an “ optical motherboard tilechiplet. ” Starlight an external laser farm that feeds those tiles with light . Today ’ s optics usually look like this You ’ ve got a discrete transceiver module in a metal “ gold box. ” Inside that box lasers modulators drivers receivers lenses fiber alignment etc . Every module is handheld robot aligned and tuned . Slow expensive powerhungry . POET ’ s interposer basically says fuck the gold box They take silicon and IIIV lasers and build everything into a flat waferscale platform . Instead of doing micronlevel alignment one module at a time they pattern the waveguides in lithography and drop the chips on with cheap pickandplace tools . Fibers line up passively so theres really no_heavy and expensive manufacturing process involved The parts on the interposer are configureable so this gives hyperscalers flexibility to choose which components and tier of components they would like on the interposer . think of the interposer like a complex lego block and you can piece together whichever legos you want to it . To visualize the interposer sits between the hot compute chips GPUsASICsNPUs and the outside world network memory pools storage and replaces a bunch of copper with light paths . Starlight is more of a accessory to the interposer . Instead of putting hot fragile lasers on the GPUpackage they park the lasers off to the side in a dedicated module . That Starlight box pumps clean laser light over fiber into a bunch of POET interposer engines sitting near the compute . The benefits are Keeps lasers away from 700W space heaters GB200 H100 etc .. One laser farm can feed many engines instead of every module lugging its own lasers . Better reliability easier maintenance and lower $ bit because you share the light source across multiple links . So together these two components work like this Starlight shared light source Interposer cheap configurable massproduced optical engine tile that is easily scalable . This is probably the biggest sell for me on this product as this gives hyperscalers more flexibility to customize the interposer So how is different from the other companies that offer a photonics solution Most of the big incumbents Broadcom Coherent Lumentum etc . are still Shipping discrete pluggable modules 400G800G etc .. Using a lot of active alignment and laborintensive packaging . Typically putting lasers inside every module which Wastes power Adds heat right where you don ’ t want it Doesn ’ t scale nicely to 1.6T 3.2T and giant AI fabrics . POET ’ s edge vs “ generic ” silicon photonics Waferscale passive alignment which lowers capex lowers assembly cost and is easier to ramp volume . Allows hybrid integration can mix and match bestofbreed lasers with silicon in one platform . Remote lasers Starlight which results in fewer total lasers and less heat on the package . And if youre wondering if any of this technology has even been validated look no_further than Marvell Technologies who purchased one of POETs largest customers Celestial AI for up to $ 5 billion . Marvells main reason for acquiring Celestial AI was for its Photonic Fabric an optical interconnect architecture that is built atop POETs Optical Interposer and uses POET ’ s Starlight as a remote laser source . In other words a serious bluechip semi company and at least one hyperscaler AWSgoogle_vignette have already done the homework on this architecture and decided it ’ s real enough to bet billions and multiyear roadmaps on . You don ’ t build a nextgen AI fabric around external lasers and waferscale photonics if you ’ re not_confident the vendors in that stack can actually meet the eye diagrams BER targets thermal budgets and manufacturing yields you need at hyperscale . The MarvellCelestial deal is basically the the big dawgs in the room saying “ Yes this class of photonic solution is how we ’ re going to attack the IO wall. ” Also Celestial AIs CEO David Lazovsky was the Executive Chairman at POET How does any of this actually help with the RAMSSD shortage POET obviously doesn ’ t fab a single DRAM chip or SSD so the way they solve the shortage is indirect but very real they change the economics of how much useful work you can squeeze out of every byte of memory and every GPU you already own . Right now hyperscalers are in a ridiculous situation . They ’ re paying insane prices for HBM DRAM and enterprise SSDs but a lot of that capacity is effectively stranded . You have GPUs sitting on islands of local HBM servers with their own DRAM storage boxes full of flash and the copper between them can ’ t move data fast enough . So to keep latency acceptable the big guys end up replicating the same data all over the place sharding models caching datasets on every node and overbuilding memory just so the network doesn ’ t become a brick wall . That ’ s fine when RAM is cheap . It ’ s a killer when HBMDRAMflash prices are up 200 % over the last month . On the power side POET ’ s own FAQ for their 800G1.6T engines spells out that by using directly modulated lasers and getting rid of extra modulators wirebonds and gearboxDSP overhead they can cut about 6–8 watts of power per module versus conventional approaches at these speeds . Six to eight watts doesn ’ t sound like much until you remember you ’ re not_deploying one module you ’ re deploying thousands . At 10000 modules across a big AI cluster that ’ s 60–80 kW of power and cooling you ’ re not_wasting just on the optics layer . That “ freed ” power budget can either lower your overall TCO or be reallocated to more GPUs and more memory in the same rackpower envelope . Then there ’ s cost . In their Starlight FAQ POET flatout says that for Celestial AI the Starlight external light source is expected to be up to 75 % cheaper than comparable light sources on the market thanks to the Optical Interposer ’ s lower bill of materials and wafer level assembly . Cheap optics are what allow hyperscalers to overspec bandwidth relative to memory which is exactly what you want when memory itself is the constrained resource . There ’ s also a quiet supply angle baked in their 1.6T transmitter is the first to efficiently use an electroabsorption modulated laser array in this way and POET explicitly calls out that it gives a “ dramatic capacity increase ” for Indium Phosphide electroabsorption modulated lasers at a time when the industry is facing shortages of those lasers . In other words they ’ re not_just stretching HBMDRAMSSD they ’ re also stretching scarce laser capacity on the photonics side by packing more usable throughput per laser device . Put that together in plain English a single POETbased engine gives you terabitclass bandwidth in a tiny footprint saves you several watts per port at 800G1.6T cuts your light source cost by as much as threequarters and increases the amount of traffic you can push per scarce laser . That ’ s what makes it a lever against the memorySSD shortages . this results in GPUs spend more time actually computing instead of waiting on IO . You need fewer duplicate copies of data sprayed across the cluster just to hide latency . You can justify architecting shared memory pools and farflash tiers because the fabric is fast and efficient enough to make them usable . So in a world where HBMDRAMSSD are the new oil and the barrels are sold out years in advance POET ’ s pitch is basically “ Let us give you 1.6 Tbpsclass optical engines that burn 6–8 W less per port and slash lightsource cost by up to 75 % so you can stop wasting the obscenely expensive memory you already have. ” This ultimately maximizes the compute potential of the present AI infrastructure to meet current AI demands and lessens the reliance on more compute power and SSDRAM . TLDR AI has turned HBMDRAMflash into the new oil . Prices are ripping supply is presold years out and hyperscalers still can ’ t get all the memory they want – but the real choke point now is how efficiently they can use the insanely expensive RAMSSD they already have and how fast they can move data between GPUs DRAM pools and storage . POET attacks that bottleneck its Optical Interposer replaces bulky “ gold box ” optics with a waferscale Legostyle optical tile and its Starlight module moves the lasers off the hot GPU package into a shared external laser farm making highbandwidth links cheaper cooler and easier to scale . That lets photonic fabrics deliver terabitclass bandwidth cut power and lightsource cost and reduce strandedduplicated data so you get more training and inference per GPU and per GB of HBMDRAMSSD instead of just bruteforcing with more hardware . In a world where memory is scarce and prebooked POET doesn ’ t make bytes – it makes the plumbing that squeezes more value out of every byte and the Marvell–Celestial AI deal is the bigcap validation that this externallaser photonicfabric path is actually where hyperscalers are headed .

      "selftext": "Well at least the near future anyway.. Carvana’s business is going in the garbage. That’s coming from a share holder and a customer 3 times. I’ve referred them to a few friends and my son as well and it’s getting extremely bad. In the beginning I bought a car for my wife, I was laid up from surgery and I wanted to suprise her with a vehicle. I did everything from my couch, the car came in 5 days, she loved it and still has it. The convienance of it was worth it alone. Now you’re lucky to get a car in under a month. That’s not exaggerating because some have waited so long they cancelled. The customer service is non existent, the reason for delays is non existent. They are literally so far behind you can’t get a car. Some would say well their sales are way up, what do you expect. These are vehicles people need and can easily get elsewhere. Take the convienance away and what do you have? A used car with a high interest rate and a dealer that can’t handle any service issues on top of it. Here in Connecticut alone, there’s been 2.5 million dollars settled in law suits already and that’s only the beginning. There’s twice as many complaints this wave and the Attorney General as submitting another gigantic law suit again. That’s just CT. I can’t imagine this company will survive if this is going on in all 50 states. It won’t be long. I’ve sold my shares and actually shorted the stock also with Puts . It was a good idea and with the right people it can be good but this has gotten too bad to fix. Mark my words.",

      "selftext": "Micron Technology (MU) shares rose over 6% in after hours trading on Wednesday after the memory chipmaker reported first quarter fiscal results and guidance that significantly exceeded Wall Street expectations. For the fiscal quarter ending 27 November, Micron posted adjusted earnings per share of $4.78, with revenue surging 57% year on year to $14.34 billion. Adjusted operating profit reached $6.42 billion, while cash flow from operating activities hit $8.41 billion a stark contrast to the $3.24 billion recorded in the same period last year. Analysts had previously forecast EPS of $3.95 and revenue of $12.95 billion. Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Micron, stated: ‘In our fiscal first quarter, Micron achieved record revenue with significant margin improvements across the company and all business segments.’ ‘Our outlook for the second quarter indicates significant record-setting levels for revenue, gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow, with business performance expected to strengthen further throughout fiscal 2026. Our technological leadership, differentiated product portfolio and robust operational execution position us as an indispensable enabler in the AI landscape, and we continue to invest to meet growing customer demand for memory and storage solutions.’ Looking ahead to the second quarter, Micron anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $8.22 and $8.62, with revenue projected at $18.3 billion to $19.1 billion. This compares to analysts' prior expectations of adjusted EPS of $4.78 and revenue of $14.3 billion.",

      "selftext": "IRobot lost a near monopoly on robot vacuums in a span of 5 years, to Chinese companies like Roborock, Ecovacs and Dreame. They were out innovated, out iterated, and despite lower prices consumers chose Chinese vacuum robots. We're seeing Chinese cars come to the forefront as well, Xiaomi, BYD, XPeng, NIO out innovate domestic auto companies. So much so that the CEO of Ford drives a Xiaomi! If restrictions weren't in place, Chinese auto would bankrupt the entire US auto industry. This happened in the span of 5-10 years. China also leap frogged the US in renewable energy in the span of the last 5 years. With China's focus now solely on AI and tech. How long will the US have a moat around AI and Chips? I feel like the Deepseek moment is only a glimpse of what's to come. China might actually send the US stock market into a recession once investors realize they'd rather pay 50% of the price for a Chinese AI that has 98% of the same capabilities.",

They were out innovated out iterated and despite lower prices consumers chose Chinese vacuum robots . Were seeing Chinese cars come to the forefront as well Xiaomi BYD XPeng NIO out innovate domestic auto companies . So much so that the CEO of Ford drives a Xiaomi If restrictions werent in place Chinese auto would bankrupt the entire US auto industry . This happened in the span of 510 years . China also leap frogged the US in renewable energy in the span of the last 5 years . With Chinas focus now solely on AI and tech . How long will the US have a moat around AI and Chips I feel like the Deepseek moment is only a glimpse of whats to come . China might actually send the US stock market into a recession once investors realize theyd rather pay 50 % of the price for a Chinese AI that has 98 % of the same capabilities ."

      "selftext": "The unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment. Historically, the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for \"recession\" (I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years) and is a measure of how unemployment is trending. For those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicator--It looks at the unemployment moving average. Fundamentally, it takes a look at the lowest 3-month moving average over a 12-month period (currently about \\~4.2%) and compares it to the most recent 3-month moving average. Essentially, if the current 3-month moving average is .50% (50 bps) higher than the 3-month moving average low, it produces a confirmation signal of \"recession\" with no historical false positives. The current moving average of unemployment is \\~4.43% which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal. If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7%, there will be real concerns about the state of the economy (will put unemployment moving average at about \\~40 bps above the moving average low). As of today's (12/17) price action, it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in January's print. The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures, but January's unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next. TL;DR--If unemployment print on 1/9/26 >4.7%, risk off. If less than, likely a neutral to risk on shift.",

      "selftext_processed": "The unemployment print this week was higher than expected and is signaling an upward trend in unemployment . Historically the Sahm indicator has been used as a confirmation tool for recession I use quotes because I feel the term has become more and more ambiguous in recent years and is a measure of how unemployment is trending . For those who are unfamiliar with the Sahm indicatorIt looks at the unemployment moving average . Fundamentally it takes a look at the lowest 3month moving average over a 12month period currently about 4.2 % and compares it to the most recent 3month moving average . Essentially if the current 3month moving average is .50 % 50 bps higher than the 3month moving average low it produces a confirmation signal of recession with no_historical false positives . The current moving average of unemployment is 4.43 % which puts us north of 20 bps toward the signal . If the January 9th print is anything higher than 4.7 % there will be real concerns about the state of the economy will put unemployment moving average at about 40 bps above the moving average low . As of todays 1217 price action it looks like the market is pricing in the possibility of an accelerating unemployment trend that could continue in Januarys print . The Fed recently cut rates which may help reduce firing rates as cost saving measures but Januarys unemployment print will be critical in understanding where the economy is at and likely where the stock market will go next . TLDRIf unemployment print on 1926 4.7 % risk off . If less than likely a neutral to risk on shift ."

NXХТ still generates most of its revenue from mobile fueling and energy logistics, but management commentary increasingly emphasizes infrastructure and grid-adjacent solutions, per recent filings. The logic is clear. Data centers, healthcare facilities, and industrial sites face grid constraints. On-site generation and microgrids address that need.

      "title": "$115k loss on options, just broke even using $80k debt",
      "selftext": "Been investing for years, but I went all in on options (mostly TSLA and CVNA puts) earlier this year. Big mistake. Wiped out almost my entire account. Down from $120k to $5k in a matter of weeks. Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem, so options aren’t a good idea for me. Went back to basics: aka penny stocks. I’ve got a lot of experience (good and bad) with small caps, and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD. Only issue is I didn’t have cash to play with. Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never taking out loans. So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me. This turned out to only be about $30k, which wasn’t enough, so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances. After a few months of this I maxed out around $80k in debt. I knew this was dumb, but fuck it! Somehow things panned out pretty well, and as of today I have finally broken even! What’s next: I’m going to keep rolling with this strategy, but will pair down the debt significantly. Mainly just the credit card debt, with a target around $20k debt, which at 25% utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again. Once I hit $500k, I’ll clear the debt fully. Takeaways: \\- Don’t short meme stocks \\- Short term options are not worth the risk \\- Learn from your mistakes and seek help \\- Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025, I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024. Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts. Shockingly, the lower fees didn’t help much. \\-------- EDIT ---------- Seeing a lot of people saying they're in a similar position to me, so just to be clear: **I got lucky, and risked blowing my account up beyond repair. If you're in a similar position, please seek help** through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist. If you've had similar losses, you're almost certainly also a gambling addict, and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been investing for years but I went all in on options mostly TSLA and CVNA puts earlier this year . Big mistake . Wiped out almost my entire account . Down from $ 120k to $ 5k in a matter of weeks . Turns out I have a bit of a gambling problem so options aren ’ t a good idea for me . Went back to basics aka penny stocks . I ’ ve got a lot of experience good and bad with small caps and decided to only focus on buying and holing long after doing extensive DD . Only issue is I didn ’ t have cash to play with . Fortunately I had excellent credit on account of always auto paying credit cards and never_taking out loans . So I called up all the financial institutions I had banked with and asked them for the biggest loans they would give me . This turned out to only be about $ 30k which wasn ’ t enough so I set my credit cards to interest only payments and started taking out cash advances . After a few months of this I maxed out around $ 80k in debt . I knew this was dumb but fuck it Somehow things panned out pretty well and as of today I have finally broken even What ’ s next I ’ m going to keep rolling with this strategy but will pair down the debt significantly . Mainly just the credit card debt with a target around $ 20k debt which at 25 % utilization should be enough to get my credit score moving up again . Once I hit $ 500k I ’ ll clear the debt fully . Takeaways Don ’ t short meme stocks Short term options are not_worth the risk Learn from your mistakes and seek help Loans are hard to get when you need them most For those who have a keen eye wondering why I already had losses prior to 2025 I sold my portfolio at another broker and moved it all into my current account in 2024 . Moved it all over to my current account just to save transaction fees when punting it all on TSLA puts . Shockingly the lower fees didn ’ t help much . EDIT Seeing a lot of people saying theyre in a similar position to me so just to be clear I got lucky and risked blowing my account up beyond repair . If youre in a similar position please seek help through Gamblers Anonymous or some other addition specialist . If youve had similar losses youre almost certainly also a gambling addict and the best thing you can do is get help for that before anything else ."

      "selftext": "I have been trying to dig through Softbank's balance sheet, but for me this is rather opaque, so would be happy if someone could shed light on the real risk here. Looking at the annual report (I disclaim that I might make errors copying), on the 25th of March they had (page 102): 45 trillion yen in assets, 31 trillion yen in liabilities. Now, in other places they claim loan to value of about 18%. What's actually the case here? (I seriously tried to get a view, but I find this much more difficult to understand than typical bank balance sheets, there's a lot of talk around the numbers...). Particularly, they then had 87% in Arm holdings, so if that devalues (which it is doing right now), how much can that affect their financial stability? In principle, such downvaluations could erase their own capital, but do they have hidden reserves that could be activated? Of course this has larger implications, since they finance parts of openAI, and so this can radiate over to things like Oracle. Any constructive discussion will be highly welcome!",

      "title": "Nebius is a steal at this price, change my mind",
      "selftext": "I’m currently averaged at $96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I’d waited a bit longer to build my position. At these levels though, I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued. A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle’s earnings. At current pricing, this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me. Here's why: **- AI compute is structurally undersupplied.** This is not a short cycle issue. Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply, power availability and data center capacity. Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck. Nebius sits right in that bottleneck. **- Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives** Microsoft signed up to $19.4B in multi year GPU capacity. Meta followed with another $3B. These are not pilot projects or optional experiments. This is mission critical infrastructure. If Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute, the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level. \\- **Extreme growth** Q3 revenue was up 355% YoY. ARR today is roughly $550M and guided to ramp to $7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online. AI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20%. **- Capex is not the problem people think it is** Yes, capex is massive. That is the business. But Nebius is sitting on roughly $5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates. Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals. **- This is the most important one, everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business** Most people talk about Nebius as if it’s just an AI cloud provider. That’s missing a big part of the picture. On top of the cloud business, Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero (!!) by the market right now. Avride ($2-3B valuation) is now partnered with Uber. Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots, which is a massive market on its own. Then there’s TripleTen ($300-500M)growing fast in a high margin digital space On top of that, Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse ($2B) . These aren’t random side projects, they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past. If you do even conservative sum of the parts math, you’re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business. Right now, the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “AI cloud plus execution risk” and ignoring everything else. If Nebius actually hits the target of $7–9B ARR in 2026, you’re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business. While others easily have a multiple of 5-10. **- The real risks** I don't want to turn a blind eye to the risk, because ofc there are: \\- Data center build timelines slipping \\- Customer concentration \\- Share dilution over time All real. But they are execution risks, not demand risks. Chance of execution is (in my opinion) the highest at Nebius compared to others, because of their former Yandex experience. This all seems to good to be true to me, so please convince me if i'm missing something here. Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120-150$ according to my research.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m currently averaged at $ 96 on Nebius and I definitely wish I ’ d waited a bit longer to build my position . At these levels though I genuinely think the stock is massively undervalued . A lot of the recent decline feels driven by bad sentiment driven by bad sentiment and a broader sell off after Oracle ’ s earnings . At current pricing this looks like one of the biggest steals in the market to me . Heres why AI compute is structurally undersupplied . This is not_a short cycle issue . Training and inference demand keeps growing faster than GPU supply power availability and data center capacity . Companies that can actually deliver large scale GPU clusters with power and networking are the bottleneck . Nebius sits right in that bottleneck . Hyperscaler validation matters more than narratives Microsoft signed up to $ 19.4B in multi year GPU capacity . Meta followed with another $ 3B . These are not_pilot projects or optional experiments . This is mission critical infrastructure . If Microsoft and Meta are willing to rely on Nebius for AI compute the tech works and the execution bar has already been cleared at a very high level . Extreme growth Q3 revenue was up 355 % YoY . ARR today is roughly $ 550M and guided to ramp to $ 7–9B by the end of 2026 as contracted capacity comes online . AI operations are already EBITDA positive with margins around 20 % . Capex is not_the problem people think it is Yes capex is massive . That is the business . But Nebius is sitting on roughly $ 5B in cash and raised convertibles at extremely low interest rates . Capital markets are clearly comfortable financing this growth because the demand is locked in by secured deals . This is the most important one everyone keeps forgetting the extra assets they own besides the cloud business Most people talk about Nebius as if it ’ s just an AI cloud provider . That ’ s missing a big part of the picture . On top of the cloud business Nebius still owns several assets that have real value and are basically being priced at a huge discount or in my opinion even close to zero by the market right now . Avride $ 23B valuation is now partnered with Uber . Avride is working with Uber on delivery robots which is a massive market on its own . Then there ’ s TripleTen $ 300500Mgrowing fast in a high margin digital space On top of that Nebius still has stakes in things like AI data annotation and database tech through Toloka and ClickHouse $ 2B . These aren ’ t random side projects they sit right in the AI value chain and have raised at serious private valuations in the past . If you do even conservative sum of the parts math you ’ re talking about several billion in value outside of the core cloud business . Right now the market seems to be valuing Nebius almost purely as “ AI cloud plus execution risk ” and ignoring everything else . If Nebius actually hits the target of $ 7–9B ARR in 2026 you ’ re looking at a forward revenue multiple of roughly 2.4x for the core cloud business . While others easily have a multiple of 510 . The real risks I dont want to turn a blind eye to the risk because ofc there are Data center build timelines slipping Customer concentration Share dilution over time All real . But they are execution risks not_demand risks . Chance of execution is in my opinion the highest at Nebius compared to others because of their former Yandex experience . This all seems to good to be true to me so please convince me if im missing something here . Even a base case should provide a valuation of roughly 120150 $ according to my research ."

      "selftext": "I'd be curious to hear opinions on Wealthfront's recent IPO -- ticker WLTH. Not that it matters much, but my own background: The majority of my portfolio is pretty bog standard broad ETFs -- yes, the lion's share in a 401k with pretty boring allocations via your standard mix of blocks. I have a taxable investment account with Wealthfront *and* an individual account I use for individual equities. Why both? Well, I hit a jackpot in my individual account (bought into NVDA in 2020) and also had some other success stories... and ironically? I always told myself \"If you can't beat the robots, you're just spending money on a hobby\". 5+ years later - I'm still winning. So... that brings me to the individual stock in question. I'm a long-term, buy-and-hold guy. I **prefer** to invest in equities where I have some experience/knowledge of the underlying company. I bought into TOST at its trough a bit ago (\\~17) on the same front - profitable, but IPO out of the gate at \\~70. However, my brother is a restauranteur and through him, I've talked with plenty of others - and I felt it was really best-in-class, like their growth, and while not a huge win like NVDA? It's certainly paid off - and I continue to like it under \\~35. And... I've used Wealthfront - it's my primary HYSA nowadays (though not my only one, but my largest) and as noted, also have a taxable \"robo-ETF\" account with them. I've been a customer for nearly 7 years now -- and I *do* give them high marks. I really like the platform. I really like the ingenuity. As much as I don't avail myself? I also like them dipping into further fintech area. My baseline thoughts - On the plus side: \\- Fairly rare for an IPO to already be profitable. They are \\- The P/E looks fine - \\~15. \\- Still showing growth \\- Expanding offerings On the pause/minus side: \\- HIGHLY competitive space - when I chose Wealthfront? Nearly a coinflip between them and Betterment. Robinhood, a bazillion others -- HIGHLY competitive \\- Growth is tailing off - still growing, but no longer a multiplier. \\- Never had good luck with financials I don't believe in trying to \"time\" buys -- and as with nearly every IPO, they're bleeding off a bit. But... I like the company. Part of me wants to wait a few quarters and compare some 10-Qs... the other part says I like the company, like the financials, etc. Would love to hear other thoughts....",

      "selftext_processed": "Id be curious to hear opinions on Wealthfronts recent IPO ticker WLTH . Not_that it matters much but my own background The majority of my portfolio is pretty bog standard broad ETFs yes the lions share in a 401k with pretty boring allocations via your standard mix of blocks . I have a taxable investment account with Wealthfront and an individual account I use for individual equities . Why both Well I hit a jackpot in my individual account bought into NVDA in 2020 and also had some other success stories ... and ironically I always told myself If you cant beat the robots youre just spending money on a hobby . 5 years later Im still winning . So ... that brings me to the individual stock in question . Im a longterm buyandhold guy . I prefer to invest in equities where I have some experienceknowledge of the underlying company . I bought into TOST at its trough a bit ago 17 on the same front profitable but IPO out of the gate at 70 . However my brother is a restauranteur and through him Ive talked with plenty of others and I felt it was really bestinclass like their growth and while not_a huge win like NVDA Its certainly paid off and I continue to like it under 35 . And ... Ive used Wealthfront its my primary HYSA nowadays though not_my only one but my largest and as noted also have a taxable roboETF account with them . Ive been a customer for nearly 7 years now and I do give them high marks . I really like the platform . I really like the ingenuity . As much as I dont avail myself I also like them dipping into further fintech area . My baseline thoughts On the plus side Fairly rare for an IPO to already be profitable . They are The PE looks fine 15 . Still showing growth Expanding offerings On the pauseminus side HIGHLY competitive space when I chose Wealthfront Nearly a coinflip between them and Betterment . Robinhood a bazillion others HIGHLY competitive Growth is tailing off still growing but no_longer a multiplier . Never_had good luck with financials I dont believe in trying to time buys and as with nearly every IPO theyre bleeding off a bit . But ... I like the company . Part of me wants to wait a few quarters and compare some 10Qs ... the other part says I like the company like the financials etc . Would love to hear other thoughts ...."

It went public in September and the stock price is down 71%. It still trades at a $875M market cap and this makes no sense to me. This thing should be trading at no more than $250M. This is troublesome: \\- Its cash + accounts receivable balance as of Sep 2025 = $86M \\- It's net loss year-to-date as of Sep 2025 YTD = $92M \\- And it owes in current liabilities $113M as of Sep 2025 I don't know how this thing isn't already insolvent. The only thing it has going for it is that it has recurring annual revenue of $115M from its subscribers (although I've had two friends try to cancel their subscriptions and the process was painful for them). But the flip side of these subscribers is they are spending soooo much money to acquire and retain new subscribers. They spent $177M in sales and marketing YTD Sep 2025. This is insane! The unit economics don't work for this business, especially for a business that relies on 'hits'--getting a hit movie or series. I feel like this thing is going to $0.",

      "selftext": "If this agreement is finalized, is now a good time to increase holdings? The new core agreement deepens last month's $38 billion/7 year cloud services deal, incorporating OpenAI's adoption of Amazon's proprietary Trainium AI chips. Both parties will also explore collaboration in e-commerce which, admittedly, was within my expectations. For both parties, OpenAI can alleviate over $100 billion in computational power and talent investment pressures over the next four years while reducing its single source dependency on Nvidia chips. Amazon, meanwhile, gains a heavyweight client for its Trainium chips, bolsters its AI strategic positioning, and counters Microsoft's competitive edge. At the industry level, this partnership could break Nvidia's monopoly in the AI chip market Trainium's cost performance advantage may reshape industry cost structures and drive down AI computing prices. Simultaneously, the formation of a tech giant alliance centered on “capital + computing power + models” will accelerate. Competitors like Microsoft and Google may intensify their countermeasures, shifting global AI competition from isolated technological rivalry to ecosystem based collaboration. Small and medium sized enterprises, along with developers, will also benefit from more accessible AI tools and services.",

Both parties will also explore collaboration in ecommerce which admittedly was within my expectations . For both parties OpenAI can alleviate over $ 100 billion in computational power and talent investment pressures over the next four years while reducing its single source dependency on Nvidia chips . Amazon meanwhile gains a heavyweight client for its Trainium chips bolsters its AI strategic positioning and counters Microsofts competitive edge . At the industry level this partnership could break Nvidias monopoly in the AI chip market Trainiums cost performance advantage may reshape industry cost structures and drive down AI computing prices . Simultaneously the formation of a tech giant alliance centered on “ capital computing power models ” will accelerate . Competitors like Microsoft and Google may intensify their countermeasures shifting global AI competition from isolated technological rivalry to ecosystem based collaboration . Small and medium sized enterprises along with developers will also benefit from more accessible AI tools and services ."

IOS/market expectations: Ad growth, third party demand or IOS expansion can be a short term sentiment drivers. The disconnection between their fundamentals and price action is interesting. Liquidity is also solid, the stock show their ability to make quick muilti day moves when the vol come in. Their recent earnings showed a growth in their AdTech and SaaS business, whereas JOYY is still a mature live streaming business. Their trade based on valuation normalization and capital return. Core business: Bigo Live is JOYY’s live-streaming platform, primarily monetized through virtual gifting. In Q3, live-streaming revenue reached $388M, accounting for over 70% of total revenue. Meanwhile, JOYY is diversifying its revenue base, with BIGO Ads emerging as a strong segment, delivering around 30% year-over-year ad revenue growth and operating an external ad network similar to AppLovin. Q3 performance: Ad revenue up 29% YoY, $112.5M. BIGO Ads revenue reached $103.9M, up 33% YoY. Sequential growth was nearly 20%..They also invest heavily in AI driven ad, including models that can estimate user revenue up to seven days. These tools can improve their ROI advertiser and attract more high quality ad Balance sheet perspective: $3.32 in cash in their Q3. JOYY pays $0.97 quarterly dividend (around 6% yield) and they continue buybacks. From 2025 to 2027, Management has guided for $900M dividends and buybacks. Their valuation remains around 12.5x forward earnings, and if BIGO Ads can keep growing at 20% CAGR, JOYY can be rerated to a stronger position.",

Shares, which were priced at 104.66 yuan in the IPO, closed at 829 yuan on debut, marking a 692% jump. Similar to Moore Threads, which saw a robust debut at the start of the month, MetaX develops graphics processing units for artificial intelligence applications, tapping into a fast-growing sector driven by rising adoption of AI services. MetaX is part of a growing cohort of local chipmakers building AI processors, reflecting Beijing’s push to reduce dependence on U.S. chips following Washington’s tech curbs on export of high-end technology to China.

      "selftext": "If you're an investor with Hood you know the whole prediction markets/betting has been a surge for the stock so far this year. The price has jumped up and the annualized revenue rate looks encouraging so far. With Hood's large user base it is positioning itself as a power fintech player. But I can't help to think that this might not be the slam dunk they think it is if they go all in. Yes, this will encourage more users to put in money their accounts to make some bets but I can't help to think for many users they will draw against their accounts as money for most users is finite. But what happens if large percentage of users start betting? What happens when users start losing money big and all of a sudden users need to sell their portfolio to cover for the loses? Robinhood takes a hit on it's AUM and that user may not buy more stocks or deposite money in his account for a while. Also, if a user has $1000 to invest they perhaps in the past will buy it on equities and maybe a smaller portion on options. Will they now just allocate a portion to betting? Robinhood also takes only a small portion of each event contract so it's not like a $1 bet = $1 profit for Hood. I get why Robinhood went in on the betting and it's proven to be a hit so far. But I can't help to think they might just be cannibalizing themselves in the long run..",

The price has jumped up and the annualized revenue rate looks encouraging so far . With Hoods large user base it is positioning itself as a power fintech player . But I cant help to think that this might not_be the slam dunk they think it is if they go all in . Yes this will encourage more users to put in money their accounts to make some bets but I cant help to think for many users they will draw against their accounts as money for most users is finite . But what happens if large percentage of users start betting What happens when users start losing money big and all of a sudden users need to sell their portfolio to cover for the loses Robinhood takes a hit on its AUM and that user may not_buy more stocks or deposite money in his account for a while . Also if a user has $ 1000 to invest they perhaps in the past will buy it on equities and maybe a smaller portion on options . Will they now just allocate a portion to betting Robinhood also takes only a small portion of each event contract so its not_like a $ 1 bet $ 1 profit for Hood . I get why Robinhood went in on the betting and its proven to be a hit so far . But I cant help to think they might just be cannibalizing themselves in the long run .."

Their ex-dividend day is Dec 19 so you will get a dividend regardless, but there will be a quick run up prior. Good metrics, price-to-earnings ratio is relatively modest (low double digits), and some analysts still see upside so you're likely good short term, its a steady steam for income hunters and a safe haven during this negative cycle. High-yield, steady-income defensive play, with a run up to dividends. I've called LULU and UNH so far, I'd at least give this a look :)",

Their exdividend day is Dec 19 so you will get a dividend regardless but there will be a quick run up prior . Good metrics pricetoearnings ratio is relatively modest low double digits and some analysts still see upside so youre likely good short term its a steady steam for income hunters and a safe haven during this negative cycle . Highyield steadyincome defensive play with a run up to dividends . Ive called LULU and UNH so far Id at least give this a look"

      "title": "Warner Bros. Discovery rejects Paramount Skydance's hostile bid",
      "selftext": "Warner Bros. Discovery urged shareholders on Wednesday to reject Paramount Skydance's $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid, stating the offer posed “significant risks and costs” to the company while Netflix's earlier proposal held greater value. Multiple companies have previously competed for Warner Bros. Discovery, which owns numerous classic films including Casablanca and the Harry Potter series. On December 5, Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros. Discovery for $82.7 billion; Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8, offering to acquire the entire media group for $30 per share in an all-cash deal. Netflix has agreed to acquire Warner Bros.' HBO and its streaming and studio businesses, including HBO Max and Warner Bros. Television, for $27.75 per share. Paramount Sky Dance CEO David Ellison called it “a superior all-cash offer” when proposing to acquire all shares of Warner Bros. Discovery. Ellison stated that merging Warner Bros. Discovery's assets with those of Paramount Sky Dance (parent company of CBS News) would facilitate regulatory approval. A Paramount Pictures spokesperson has not yet responded to requests for comment. Why Warner Bros. Discovery Favors Netflix Warner Bros. Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures' offer, stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable. The company also indicated its analysis found Netflix's proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous. This has also raised concerns about the $40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media. Warner Bros. Discovery responded by stating, “The Ellison family has made no investment commitment of any kind.” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, David Ellison's father, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, is the world's fifth-richest person with a net worth of $243 billion. Shortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal, Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dance's financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid. Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner, son-in-law of former U.S. President Donald Trump. An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dance's acquisition proposal holds “strong strategic merit,” it decided to withdraw due to “significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October.” In a letter to shareholders, the Warner Bros. Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health, higher credit ratings, and greater market capitalization. The letter stated: “Netflix's merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $400 billion and an investment-grade balance sheet.” Warner Bros. Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dance's credit rating “is at or just one notch above ‘junk’ status with two major rating agencies,” while its market capitalization stands at $15 billion. Warner Bros. Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramount's plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer. “The trust's assets and liabilities would not be publicly disclosed and could change,” it wrote in its letter to shareholders. “As the name implies, revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time.” Although Wednesday's shareholder letter indicated that Paramount's acquisition offer is not favored by Warner Bros.' board, shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramount's bid for the entire company, including cable assets such as CNN, Discovery, and TNT.",

On December 5 Netflix agreed to acquire a portion of Warner Bros . Discovery for $ 82.7 billion Paramount Skydance Media Group followed suit on December 8 offering to acquire the entire media group for $ 30 per share in an allcash deal .

Discovery advised shareholders to reject Paramount Pictures offer stating its board believes the regulatory risks of both acquisition proposals are comparable . The company also indicated its analysis found Netflixs proposal which includes cash and Netflix stock to be more advantageous . This has also raised concerns about the $ 40.65 billion equity investment in Paramount Sky Dance Media . Warner Bros . Discovery responded by stating “ The Ellison family has made no_investment commitment of any kind. ” According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index David Ellisons father Oracle CEO Larry Ellison is the worlds fifthrichest person with a net worth of $ 243 billion . Shortly before WarnerMedia made its proposal Affinity Partners one of Paramount Sky Dances financial backers announced its withdrawal from the hostile takeover bid . Affinity is a private equity firm founded by Jared Kushner soninlaw of former U.S. President Donald Trump . An Affinity spokesperson told CBS News that while the firm still believes Paramount Sky Dances acquisition proposal holds “ strong strategic merit ” it decided to withdraw due to “ significant shifts in investment dynamics since our initial participation in October. ” In a letter to shareholders the Warner Bros . Discovery board stated it views Netflix as having superior financial health higher credit ratings and greater market capitalization . The letter stated “ Netflixs merger is fully backed by a publicly traded company with a market capitalization exceeding $ 400 billion and an investmentgrade balance sheet. ” Warner Bros . Discovery added that Paramount Sky Dances credit rating “ is at or just one notch above ‘ junk ’ status with two major rating agencies ” while its market capitalization stands at $ 15 billion . Warner Bros . Discovery also expressed concerns about Paramounts plan to use a revocable trust to provide debt financing as part of its acquisition offer . “ The trusts assets and liabilities would not_be publicly disclosed and could change ” it wrote in its letter to shareholders . “ As the name implies revocable trusts typically contain provisions allowing assets to be transferred at any time. ” Although Wednesdays shareholder letter indicated that Paramounts acquisition offer is not_favored by Warner Bros. board shareholders can still decide whether to accept Paramounts bid for the entire company including cable assets such as CNN Discovery and TNT ."

      "selftext": "So, I came across some news on Zhito Finance. The global AI tech industry is booming, and almost all the infrastructure supporting it is growing fast. Major Wall Street players like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan are even restructuring their TMT (Tech, Media, and Telecom) investment banking teams. Goldman Sachs just released a field report on the AI computing power supply chain in Asia. They expect demand for AI server clusters to keep growing strongly through 2026. The demand for optical network equipment is also super high, and while DRAM storage chip supply is still growing slowly, demand is far outstripping supply. Now, Nvidia’s stock has been climbing like crazy, and the AI market demand is massive. It feels like a strong signal to jump in and make some quick gains. But my friends keep telling me the price is too high right now and I should be cautious. I don’t wanna miss this chance, though. What do you all think? I’d love to hear your thoughts and advice.

As of recently, I’ve dug more into their stretched valuation and last quarters results (as best I can with the brain I have) and am trying to weigh that against some the positives (AWS contract, acquisitions in Ohio, share buy backs etc). I am debating if I should hold or if I’d better off taking my profit (approx 39%) and putting into something else with more growth potential (I have ideas but that’s a different discussion). Any opinions either way would be greatly appreciated. First time posting so apologies in advance if this isn’t the appropriate forum (I think it is).",

I am debating if I should hold or if I ’ d better off taking my profit approx 39 % and putting into something else with more growth potential I have ideas but that ’ s a different discussion . Any opinions either way would be greatly appreciated . First time posting so apologies in advance if this isn ’ t the appropriate forum I think it is ."

      "selftext": "Since the April lows, major U.S. stock indices have staged a significant rebound: the S&P 500 has risen approximately 37%, while the Nasdaq 100 has gained about 51%, with overall levels approaching historical highs. Notably, despite the substantial expansion in index gains, the three month implied volatility of S&P 500 constituents remains only slightly below the actual volatility over the same period. This indicates that the options market has not yet overpriced near term risks, and the risk premium still holds some appeal. Taking Broadcom as an example, the company currently trades at a P/E ratio of approximately 72.06, reflecting a high valuation. However, market consensus projects its fiscal 2026 revenue to grow by about 51% year over year, highlighting its robust growth certainty. Considering the company is expected to release its next earnings report in approximately 71 days on February 26, 2026, with a key fundamental catalyst approaching but valuations already elevated, participating in upside potential through call options replacing part of the equity exposure at a limited cost offers a clear advantage in risk-reward ratio. Furthermore, Broadcom has increased its dividend for 16 consecutive years, reflecting robust cash flow generation and a disciplined approach to long term shareholder returns. This characteristic reinforces its status as a “high-valuation but high quality” asset, making it a rational choice for position management using more sophisticated tools. Overall, in an environment where indices are elevated, implied volatility has yet to rise significantly, and individual stocks maintain fundamental strength and mid term growth logic, substituting call options for part of the equity position represents a rational and mature strategy choice. It effectively compresses downside risk while preserving upside participation. This is just my personal view.Would you choose to go long on Avgo?",

      "selftext": "Microcaps can move in a self reinforcing way because the shareholder base is small and liquidity is thin. A single expectation change can attract incremental volume, which changes visibility, which can change financing terms and media coverage. That loop does not require perfection. It only requires the market to believe the next few quarters look better than the last few. RIME has a few ingredients that make this dynamic possible. The company is around a $5M market cap, and it already shows up in institutional filings. Fintel compiled data lists Vanguard Group at about 20,010 shares and Geode Capital Management at about 19,606 shares, alongside index fund exposure through extended market funds (source type: 13F and NPORT filings as compiled by Fintel). Those are small positions, but they confirm the ticker sits inside institutional data systems. On the business side, SemiCab slides shown privately cite ARR rising from about $2.1M to roughly $15.0M over about 18 months, plus enterprise contracts sized above $5M per year and one above $8M per year (source: company presentation). If even part of that trajectory becomes visible in public filings, the valuation could reset from a low base. Do your own research.",

A single expectation change can attract incremental volume which changes visibility which can change financing terms and media coverage . That loop does not_require perfection . It only requires the market to believe the next few quarters look better than the last few . RIME has a few ingredients that make this dynamic possible . The company is around a $ 5M market cap and it already shows up in institutional filings . Fintel compiled data lists Vanguard Group at about 20010 shares and Geode Capital Management at about 19606 shares alongside index fund exposure through extended market funds source type 13F and NPORT filings as compiled by Fintel . Those are small positions but they confirm the ticker sits inside institutional data systems . On the business side SemiCab slides shown privately cite ARR rising from about $ 2.1M to roughly $ 15.0M over about 18 months plus enterprise contracts sized above $ 5M per year and one above $ 8M per year source company presentation . If even part of that trajectory becomes visible in public filings the valuation could reset from a low base . Do your own research ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching the Warner Bros situation, and it’s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals, except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war. The latest development is pretty straightforward. Jared Kushner’s PE firm, Affinity Partners, has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance’s hostile bid. From what’s been reported, it was only about a $200M check in the grand scheme of things, but it still mattered. It wasn’t a big piece of the financing, but it was a politically connected name, and that backing is now gone. (News source, if you’re interested: [Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy, Pivot To Theaters.]( Netflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $27.75 per share, or roughly $72B. Paramount Skydance countered with a $30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders. The reporting so far suggests WBD’s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid. What makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal. Paramount’s bid comes with big name backers, but it also brings political baggage. The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight, which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper. WBD’s Q3 2025 release showed about $9.0B in revenue, down excluding FX. The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks, especially with the debt load still hanging over the company. That’s why Affinity walking away doesn’t really change how I read the situation. It hurts the optics of the hostile bid, but it doesn’t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse, or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been watching the Warner Bros situation and it ’ s starting to feel like one of those cases where the headlines are louder than the fundamentals except now the headlines have turned into an actual bidding war . The latest development is pretty straightforward . Jared Kushner ’ s PE firm Affinity Partners has pulled its financing support from Paramount Skydance ’ s hostile bid . From what ’ s been reported it was only about a $ 200M check in the grand scheme of things but it still mattered . It wasn ’ t a big piece of the financing but it was a politically connected name and that backing is now gone . News source if you ’ re interested Netflix CEOs Defend WBD Buy Pivot To Theaters . Netflix already has an agreed deal to buy WBD at $ 27.75 per share or roughly $ 72B . Paramount Skydance countered with a $ 30 per share all cash hostile offer aimed directly at shareholders . The reporting so far suggests WBD ’ s board is leaning toward sticking with Netflix rather than engaging with the hostile bid . What makes this situation feel unusual to me is that non financial factors are wrapped around the deal . Paramount ’ s bid comes with big name backers but it also brings political baggage . The CBS and Trump comments have pulled the deal into the public spotlight which can slow the process down even if the headline price looks higher on paper . WBD ’ s Q3 2025 release showed about $ 9.0B in revenue down excluding FX . The market has been watching whether improvements in streaming profitability can continue to offset the decline in linear networks especially with the debt load still hanging over the company . That ’ s why Affinity walking away doesn ’ t really change how I read the situation . It hurts the optics of the hostile bid but it doesn ’ t suddenly make the Netflix deal look worse or make the underlying tradeoffs any simpler ."

      "selftext": "SP500 dips whenever there's an earning call, and Micron earning call probably make all of us bleed again this week, especially with the RAM fuckery going on. GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410, along with all shelter miners. Crypto-adjacent securities are not surging because crypto is still limp. Now yen is getting stronger, dollar getting cheaper, and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities, and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next. Nomura and Mizuho (ADRs) NMR / MFG are incredibly undervalued, two of the three top-tier Japanese banks, and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates, and crafters of these new policies. They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first government-backed crypto stable yen, which basically means state-adjacent crypto finance from big lenders... the potential is quite huge. Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley, which still gets ignored. NMR’s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts. NMR’s dividend yield is higher than most so-called dividend princesses or whatever the name is. MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin, and NMR is the reason for that. They’ve been moving slowly in the ADRs, and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year. Price action alone (USD/JPY echange rate) is making this change, higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less. Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive, and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online, the deranged fantasy of getting cheap low-interest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests... will be not only a reality, but a practice.",

GLD is also full to the brim probably be pumped and dumped again once it hits 410 along with all shelter miners . Cryptoadjacent securities are not_surging because crypto is still limp . Now yen is getting stronger dollar getting cheaper and cheap dollars are used to pump the same securities and institutionals just swing trade from one earning call to the next . Nomura and Mizuho ADRs NMR MFG are incredibly undervalued two of the three toptier Japanese banks and these are the direct beneficiaries of a stronger yen and rising interest rates and crafters of these new policies . They are two of the biggest corporate lenders and behind the first governmentbacked crypto stable yen which basically means stateadjacent crypto finance from big lenders ... the potential is quite huge . Nomura owns roughly half of Morgan Stanley which still gets ignored . NMR ’ s financial division made a billion dollars using QQQ puts . NMR ’ s dividend yield is higher than most socalled dividend princesses or whatever the name is . MS has stated they want to do a USD stable coin and NMR is the reason for that . They ’ ve been moving slowly in the ADRs and have been two of my great portfolio shelters during this shit year . Price action alone USDJPY echange rate is making this change higher yen and lower dollar means you are effectively now buying more for less . Their share buybacks have turned very aggressive and once the stable yen goes fully online worldwide and the USD version is also online the deranged fantasy of getting cheap lowinterest crypto insta loans send yen using a shit broker account to pay your shit mortgage or repay loans or flip exchange rates interests ... will be not_only a reality but a practice ."

      "selftext": "I bought a bunch the last two days. These low prices are purely political. Turmp is close with MBS. They have been trading geopolitical favors for a while. Trump wants oil low, inflation down, MBS has been pumping despite the low prices. Usually this is when OPEC+ will turn it down. China has benefitted from the Venezuela, Russia, and Iran sanctions for years buying all their sanctioned oil on the discount. It’s not a huge amount, but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “private” market they have been stocking up on. If China has to start buying in the open market, oil prices are pretty inelastic on the short term. My average costs is $56.55 after averaging down some more today. Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up. Quick math but I I own (65 contracts x $6 07 x 9x leverage per contract ) That’s like $355,000 of oil futures. It’s a lot of fun with the leverage! 1% in either directions and it’s like $5-10k. 🥭 might go on TV, nuke the Venezuela tankers, and we see a 2-3% movement no problem. This is any easy play. I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $20,000-30,000 gain if it hit $60+",

      "selftext_processed": "I bought a bunch the last two days . These low prices are purely political . Turmp is close with MBS . They have been trading geopolitical favors for a while . Trump wants oil low inflation down MBS has been pumping despite the low prices . Usually this is when OPEC will turn it down . China has benefitted from the Venezuela Russia and Iran sanctions for years buying all their sanctioned oil on the discount . It ’ s not_a huge amount but taking their Venezuela 🇻🇪 production off the market will cause a disruption in this “ private ” market they have been stocking up on . If China has to start buying in the open market oil prices are pretty inelastic on the short term . My average costs is $ 56.55 after averaging down some more today . Still have some limit orders if it drops more and will continue to load up . Quick math but I I own 65 contracts x $ 6 07 x 9x leverage per contract That ’ s like $ 355000 of oil futures . It ’ s a lot of fun with the leverage 1 % in either directions and it ’ s like $ 510k . 🥭 might go on TV nuke the Venezuela tankers and we see a 23 % movement no_problem . This is any easy play . I have 3 months to wait this this out for a $ 2000030000 gain if it hit $ 60"

      "selftext": "I’m currently managing a mid-7-figure portfolio that’s done well, but it’s basically a \"barbell\" right now: 1/3 cash and nearly 1/2 heavy tech concentration. With the Fed cutting and the 2026 outlook looking messy (deficits, tariffs, etc), I'm trying to move from passive holding into a more defensive macro setup. Current mess: - 43% Tech/Nasdaq (QQQ plus heavy single stock exposure in Mag 7) - 31% Cash (mostly SPAXX/Money Market at 5%) - 20% S&P 500 - 6% International (Total world) The Issues: 1. Cash drag: 31% in cash as rates drop to 3-3.5% is just asking for income erosion. 2. Overlap: Owning QQQ plus individual tech names is redundant. 3. China risk: My current international fund is weighed down by China, which I want out of for 2026. Proposed New Target: I’m planning to dump the Nasdaq index and broad international funds to clean up the overlap and China risk, then move the bulk of the cash into intermediate bonds and some \"real economy\" hedges. 33% - High Conviction Tech (Single names only): Retaining my highest conviction plays directly to avoid the \"fluff\" in QQQ. I see these as cash flow plays that are safer than the broader index. 20% - S&P 500 (IVV): My boring core. 18% - Intermediate Corp Bonds (VCIT): Moving the cash here to lock in ~4.8% yields and get some capital appreciation as the Fed continues to cut. Preferring corporates over treasuries for the extra cushion. 9% - Mid-Cap Value (VOE): This is my \"real economy\" play. Targets industrials/financials that should benefit from onshoring and a steeper yield curve. Helps me diversify away from the Mag 7. 8% - EM ex-China (VEXC): Swapping broad international for EM excluding China. I want the growth in India/Vietnam/Taiwan without the China drag. 7% - Cash (SPAXX): Just keeping some dry powder for emergencies/opportunities. 5% - Bitcoin (IBIT): Hedge against fiscal debasement/deficits. Questions for you guys: 1. Is moving that much cash into VCIT (Intermediate Corps) the right way to play the rate cycle, or is the credit risk too high if things get recessionary? 2. Is the Ex-China (VEXC) play actually effective for international growth, or should I just stick to developed markets? Appreciate any thoughts or sanity checks on this.",

With the Fed cutting and the 2026 outlook looking messy deficits tariffs etc Im trying to move from passive holding into a more defensive macro setup . Current mess 43 % TechNasdaq QQQ plus heavy single stock exposure in Mag 7 31 % Cash mostly SPAXXMoney Market at 5 % 20 % SP 500 6 % International Total world The Issues 1 . Cash drag 31 % in cash as rates drop to 33.5 % is just asking for income erosion . 2 . Overlap Owning QQQ plus individual tech names is redundant . 3 . China risk My current international fund is weighed down by China which I want out of for 2026 . Proposed New Target I ’ m planning to dump the Nasdaq index and broad international funds to clean up the overlap and China risk then move the bulk of the cash into intermediate bonds and some real economy hedges . 33 % High Conviction Tech Single names only Retaining my highest conviction plays directly to avoid the fluff in QQQ . I see these as cash flow plays that are safer than the broader index . 20 % SP 500 IVV My boring core . 18 % Intermediate Corp Bonds VCIT Moving the cash here to lock in 4.8 % yields and get some capital appreciation as the Fed continues to cut . Preferring corporates over treasuries for the extra cushion . 9 % MidCap Value VOE This is my real economy play . Targets industrialsfinancials that should benefit from onshoring and a steeper yield curve . Helps me diversify away from the Mag 7 . 8 % EM exChina VEXC Swapping broad international for EM excluding China . I want the growth in IndiaVietnamTaiwan without the China drag . 7 % Cash SPAXX Just keeping some dry powder for emergenciesopportunities . 5 % Bitcoin IBIT Hedge against fiscal debasementdeficits . Questions for you guys 1 . Is moving that much cash into VCIT Intermediate Corps the right way to play the rate cycle or is the credit risk too high if things get recessionary 2 . Is the ExChina VEXC play actually effective for international growth or should I just stick to developed markets Appreciate any thoughts or sanity checks on this ."

      "selftext": "December 16 (Reuters) Warner Bros. Discovery's board of directors may announce its decision on Paramount Sky Dance's $108.4 billion acquisition offer as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. The board is expected to recommend shareholders vote against the bid. The renewed acceptance of Netflix's acquisition offer marks the latest development in this bidding war. The target of this contest includes Warner Bros.' storied film and television studio, along with its vast library of movies and TV shows a portfolio spanning classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to contemporary hits such as Harry Potter and Friends, as well as the HBO and HBO Max streaming services. A Warner Bros. Discovery spokesperson declined to comment. The winner will gain a significant advantage in the streaming wars by securing a vast content library that has long been a target for acquisition. Earlier this month, Netflix ultimately prevailed in its $27 billion cash-and-stock acquisition of Warner Bros.' non-cable assets. Paramount CEO David Ellison subsequently made a direct, all-cash $30-per-share takeover bid to Warner Bros. shareholders. Paramount stated in filings submitted to regulators that its acquisition proposal is superior to Netflix's bid and more likely to secure regulatory approval. Paramount's acquisition plan consists of $41 billion in new equity backed by the Ellison family and Redbird Capital, along with $54 billion in debt financing commitments from Bank of America, Citigroup, and Apollo Global Management. According to Bloomberg, Affinity Partners, a firm owned by Jared Kushner and one of Paramount Pictures' financing partners, will withdraw from the competition. Paramount Pictures and Affinity Partners did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.",

      "selftext": "TSLA surged against the market trend today, reaching a new all-time high of $491.5, while Elon Musk's net worth soared to over $670 billion. This stands in stark contrast to the company's core business struggles, including a nearly 40% drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries. The truth is: Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLA's automotive business. They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning. What they truly value is the $1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software, the multi-trillion-dollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026, and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all. This high-risk gamble, which completely ties personal wealth, grand narratives, and extreme valuations together, means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $3 trillion or see its dreams shattered. At this point, would you buy at a high price, or would you wait and see?",

      "selftext_processed": "TSLA surged against the market trend today reaching a new alltime high of $ 491.5 while Elon Musks net worth soared to over $ 670 billion . This stands in stark contrast to the companys core business struggles including a nearly 40 % drop in European sales and institutional forecasts of declining Q4 deliveries . The truth is Wall Street has completely abandoned fundamental analysis of TSLAs automotive business . They are making a massive gamble that Musk will successfully transform into the core of an AI empire $ 1.6 trillion market capitalization is just the beginning . What they truly value is the $ 1 trillion profit potential of the FSD software the multitrilliondollar market for CyberCab and Optimus robots by 2026 and the epic narrative of the SpaceX space economy behind it all . This highrisk gamble which completely ties personal wealth grand narratives and extreme valuations together means that TSLA is a bet that will either reach $ 3 trillion or see its dreams shattered . At this point would you buy at a high price or would you wait and see"

      "selftext": "Warner Bros. Discovery is preparing to advise its shareholders to reject Paramount Skydance’s hostile takeover bid, with a formal recommendation expected as early as Wednesday, according to people familiar with the matter. Paramount’s proposal valued Warner Bros. Discovery at roughly $108 billion in an all-cash offer, or about $30 per share, but board members have expressed concerns over the offer’s financing, structure and overall terms compared with other strategic options. The board appears inclined to recommend the company’s existing deal with Netflix which combines cash and stock and focuses on core studio and streaming assets as a more secure and valuable path forward for shareholders. The market has reacted to the escalating deal drama, with Warner Bros. Discovery’s stock weakening as news of the planned rejection circulated. Investors are watching closely as Paramount’s bid backed in part by funding from equity and debt partners faces internal resistance, and as other players like Netflix remain in contention. Also, Jared Kushner’s Affinity Partners has reportedly exited the takeover battle, marking a shift in financing participation for the Paramount bid. Paramount still has time to revise or sweeten its offer before its tender deadline in early January, but Warner Bros. Discovery’s board seems poised to side with the alternative that they believe offers greater certainty and value for shareholders",

      "selftext": "Before this post gets vamooshed for low effort posting, let me preface by saying I'm going to try my best not to make this the basic post the title suggests it is. I know there's a million threads about this. Statistically, unless you're retiring soon, putting everything into the market is better than trying to time it and holding cash, and waiting. That said, I am helping my father invest a sizeable amount of money in the market. He's always said that the markets are crazy overvalued, so he has kept his money invested in small local businesses. However, as he gets older, he wants to shift some funds into the market. Let's say he has a couple of million waiting to put into the market. Currently, it's sitting in SGOV. Would it be wise to start DCAing and holding cash for a crash, or should he allocate everything ASAP (into a broad market ETF)? Also, assume this would be money he could lose and still retire as he still has significant diversified local business equity. I know by asking this I'm contradicting what I said in the preface of this post, but for a while now, it's felt like another harsh correction is overdue. As a young investor myself, it's hard for me to piece together if things are really the same as always, or if anything is actually different this time. Especially with the current administration going guns blazing with economic and foreign policy. I'd love some more seasoned investors to share their input. On one side, P/E ratios suggest a bubble, but on the other hand, some say this is just the new kind of market we're living in. I don't expect a definitive answer (since I don't think anyone really knows), but I wanted to get some real people's opinions.",

I know theres a million threads about this . Statistically unless youre retiring soon putting everything into the market is better than trying to time it and holding cash and waiting . That said I am helping my father invest a sizeable amount of money in the market . Hes always said that the markets are crazy overvalued so he has kept his money invested in small local businesses . However as he gets older he wants to shift some funds into the market . Lets say he has a couple of million waiting to put into the market . Currently its sitting in SGOV . Would it be wise to start DCAing and holding cash for a crash or should he allocate everything ASAP into a broad market ETF Also assume this would be money he could lose and still retire as he still has significant diversified local business equity . I know by asking this Im contradicting what I said in the preface of this post but for a while now its felt like another harsh correction is overdue . As a young investor myself its hard for me to piece together if things are really the same as always or if anything is actually different this time . Especially with the current administration going guns blazing with economic and foreign policy . Id love some more seasoned investors to share their input . On one side PE ratios suggest a bubble but on the other hand some say this is just the new kind of market were living in . I dont expect a definitive answer since I dont think anyone really knows but I wanted to get some real peoples opinions ."

      "title": "Tesla stock hits record as Wall Street rallies around robotaxi hype despite slow EV sales",
      "selftext": "Tesla’s stock just set a new record, breaking past its previous all-time high from almost exactly a year ago. The rally comes after a wild 12 months for shareholders including a brutal 36% drop in Q1, the stock’s worst quarterly performance since 2022. What’s driving the rebound now seems to be renewed optimism around Tesla’s long-promised robotaxi vision. Investors appear to be betting that Tesla can finally convert its existing fleet of EVs into autonomous, revenue-generating vehicles, rather than treating autonomy as a distant concept. Still, it’s hard to ignore how quickly sentiment has flipped. From heavy losses early in the year to record highs now, Tesla remains one of the most emotion-driven names in the market. Do you see this move as confidence in real progress on autonomy, or just another sentiment-driven Tesla cycle? Source:",

Concerns center on thinner liquidity during overnight hours, bigger price swings, and whether constant trading would amplify short-term speculation rather than improve price discovery.

Curious how others see this . Is nearly nonstop equity trading the natural next step or does it risk creating more volatility without real benefits for longterm investors Source"

Their ex-dividend day is Dec 19 so you will get a dividend regardless, but there will be a quick run up prior. Good metrics, price-to-earnings ratio is relatively modest (low double digits), and some analysts still see upside so you're likely good short term, its a steady steam for income hunters and a safe haven during this negative cycle. High-yield, steady-income defensive play, with a run up to dividends. I've called LULU and UNH so far, I'd at least give this a look :)",

Here is the chart… [ The recent volatility is offered a good entry point, which appears to be a text book Wave 4 in our Elliott Wave analysis. Wave 4 and Wave 2 generally travel the same distance, so we may still see shares fall to about $13.55 before Wave 5 starts. Keep in mind, Wave 5s tent to be the largest waves when dealing with commodities. I suspect the stock is likely going to find support here, not only will the 50-day moving average and the 200-day moving average supply support, they’re also forming a golden cross, this also all lines almost perfectly with the 38.2% Fibonacci level, the common spot where stocks typically turn around. The stock is also offering an 8.8% dividend. I don’t plan on getting rich off this one, but if you’re worried about tech and don’t just want to hold cash, I like the alternative. I am not going to cover all the fundamentals, because there would be just too much to cover. But I will say that they own mineral rights in over 20 million acres in 41 states. Whenever someone pumps and sells gas or oil at market price Black Stone gets a royalty of 20-25%. I like the sound of royalty. Plus, the just signed a deal with Caturus Energy, so they are continuing to expand. These royalty checks area only going to grow.",

Here is the chart… The recent volatility is offered a good entry point which appears to be a text book Wave 4 in our Elliott Wave analysis . Wave 4 and Wave 2 generally travel the same distance so we may still see shares fall to about $ 13.55 before Wave 5 starts . Keep in mind Wave 5s tent to be the largest waves when dealing with commodities . I suspect the stock is likely going to find support here not_only will the 50day moving average and the 200day moving average supply support they ’ re also forming a golden cross this also all lines almost perfectly with the 38.2 % Fibonacci level the common spot where stocks typically turn around . The stock is also offering an 8.8 % dividend . I don ’ t plan on getting rich off this one but if you ’ re worried about tech and don ’ t just want to hold cash I like the alternative . I am not_going to cover all the fundamentals because there would be just too much to cover . But I will say that they own mineral rights in over 20 million acres in 41 states . Whenever someone pumps and sells gas or oil at market price Black Stone gets a royalty of 2025 % . I like the sound of royalty . Plus the just signed a deal with Caturus Energy so they are continuing to expand . These royalty checks area only going to grow ."

      "selftext": "Basically we are all familiar with the sayings that the early bird gets the worm and the second mouse gets the cheese. I want to point that I am not entirely sure whether Tesla is fighting for a worm or cheese here. FSD will change the world but not in a way most people think. The gig work automation and the replacement of drivers etc is a solid argument but there is always more to it. FSD technology could pick your kids from school while you cook or your mother from the airport. FSD could drive your wife AND you to your jobs regardless of schedule conflicts. It could drop you at the city center and return home where parking is free. All these type of things will drastically change your life. This thing is kinda double edged though. The FSD technology albeit revolutionary is still a static technology that has no need to evolve it’s not like intel chips that were dominating for decades but today’s needs are better met with AMD. This technology will eventually kinda stop at level 5 or 6. Now let’s get to the main point. Either all heil Tesla the last standing car maker while everyone else goes bankrupt or we see FSD on every other car as well… I believe that the technology will eventually be copied and way faster than people expect. It could eventually become something like an AC. Think for example a truck that was built in the 1950s and a today’s and you ll realise that even if today trucks can haul double the load margins never doubled. This will be a catastrophe for automotive companies in a sense that it could drastically reduce the need for cars in families and peopl in general. The FSD software will also eventually become cheaper and cheaper and maybe even free. This is not a hypothetical scenario but a reality. My mouse has more complex software than a 70s computer and yet it doesnt cost anything nor it requires a subscription . The difference here again is that even if you can produce a 70s OS with chat gpt in a few minutes you need a more advanced version to execute today’s tasks but as I said this will be a static technology. So how do you take into account that even if it is a great technology due to not having a need to become more complex it will eventually be free and has no way to be monetised. I personally think the real benefit is the loyalty to the brand that pioneering innovation will bring but I am also afraid that the need for the real product is going to be drastically reduced as well. TLDR: FSD is a technology that will be eventually cheap bringing much less revenue than anticipated but will also drastically decrease the need for the underlying product",

      "selftext_processed": "Basically we are all familiar with the sayings that the early bird gets the worm and the second mouse gets the cheese . I want to point that I am not_entirely sure whether Tesla is fighting for a worm or cheese here . FSD will change the world but not_in a way most people think . The gig work automation and the replacement of drivers etc is a solid argument but there is always more to it . FSD technology could pick your kids from school while you cook or your mother from the airport . FSD could drive your wife AND you to your jobs regardless of schedule conflicts . It could drop you at the city center and return home where parking is free . All these type of things will drastically change your life . This thing is kinda double edged though . The FSD technology albeit revolutionary is still a static technology that has no_need to evolve it ’ s not_like intel chips that were dominating for decades but today ’ s needs are better met with AMD . This technology will eventually kinda stop at level 5 or 6 . Now let ’ s get to the main point . Either all heil Tesla the last standing car maker while everyone else goes bankrupt or we see FSD on every other car as well… I believe that the technology will eventually be copied and way faster than people expect . It could eventually become something like an AC . Think for example a truck that was built in the 1950s and a today ’ s and you ll realise that even if today trucks can haul double the load margins never_doubled . This will be a catastrophe for automotive companies in a sense that it could drastically reduce the need for cars in families and peopl in general . The FSD software will also eventually become cheaper and cheaper and maybe even free . This is not_a hypothetical scenario but a reality . My mouse has more complex software than a 70s computer and yet it doesnt cost anything nor it requires a subscription . The difference here again is that even if you can produce a 70s OS with chat gpt in a few minutes you need a more advanced version to execute today ’ s tasks but as I said this will be a static technology . So how do you take into account that even if it is a great technology due to not_having a need to become more complex it will eventually be free and has no_way to be monetised . I personally think the real benefit is the loyalty to the brand that pioneering innovation will bring but I am also afraid that the need for the real product is going to be drastically reduced as well . TLDR FSD is a technology that will be eventually cheap bringing much less revenue than anticipated but will also drastically decrease the need for the underlying product"

      "selftext": "# ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday, December 19th, with massive forced selling incoming. The $3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) is rebalancing and must dump $30 million in RGTI shares and another $10 million in IONQ. This isn't speculation; it's a mechanical event. RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day, meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float. Calculation: RGTI is part of other ETFs also the one's circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19-Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities. Since most other ETFs are bond+stock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome, but the point remains - RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a P/E that's negative EPS < 0 and stock price too high # Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell, insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years. There have been **zero insider purchases since June 2022**. The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th. Most damning of all, **the CEO owns zero shares** in the company he runs. The people with all the information are showing zero confidence. Last sell was 7 days ago 9-Dec. This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals. RGTI has a $10 billion market cap but generated less than $2 million in revenue last quarter. It's burning through $43.6 million in cash every 9 months, propped up by selling shares to retail investors. The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality. This Friday, a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no fundamental support. The correction is going to be brutal. **Position: +100 RGTZ. Total of 350 RGTZ.** NFA...obvi.",

      "selftext_processed": "ETF Rebalance RGTI is facing a perfect storm this Friday December 19th with massive forced selling incoming . The $ 3.2B Defiance Quantum ETF QTUM is rebalancing and must dump $ 30 million in RGTI shares and another $ 10 million in IONQ . This isnt speculation its a mechanical event . RGTI is also in other ETFs rebalancing the same day meaning even more selling pressure is coming for a stock with a low float . Calculation RGTI is part of other ETFs also the ones circled in red will be rebalanced on the 19Dec and if the calculation is similar they will also sell RGTI is large quantities . Since most other ETFs are bondstock type etfs with varied weighting we may see a slightly different outcome but the point remains RGTI has gone up over the quarter and unlike other companies it has a PE thats negative EPS 0 and stock price too high Insider Selling continues While the ETFs are forced to sell insiders have been voluntarily bailing for years . There have been zero insider purchases since June 2022 . The latest sells were just days ago on December 10th . Most damning of all the CEO owns zero shares in the company he runs . The people with all the information are showing zero confidence . Last sell was 7 days ago 9Dec . This is happening to a company with laughable fundamentals . RGTI has a $ 10 billion market cap but generated less than $ 2 million in revenue last quarter . Its burning through $ 43.6 million in cash every 9 months propped up by selling shares to retail investors . The valuation is a complete fantasy disconnected from reality . This Friday a wave of forced selling is going to crash into a stock that insiders have already abandoned and that has no_fundamental support . The correction is going to be brutal . Position 100 RGTZ . Total of 350 RGTZ . NFA ... obvi ."

      "selftext": "Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers - This Is the Core Problem The Carry Trader: A Forced Seller When the yen spikes-typically after a BoJ hike-carry traders are instantly underwater. They’re not selling U.S. equities by choice; they’re selling because margin calls leave them no alternative. These are forced liquidations. Cash is needed immediately, so they hit the bid at any price. The Domestic Buyer: Optional and Patient Yes, U.S. rate cuts are supportive for equities over time. But domestic investors are not compelled to buy today. Watching markets fall amid a carry unwind, their instinct is to wait: “Let’s see where the bottom is.” The result? A surge of “sell-at-any-price” orders and a vacuum of “buy-now” demand. Liquidity disappears, an air pocket forms, and prices freefall. The 10x Multiplier Effect Carry trades are rarely 1:1 with cash. They’re highly leveraged, often 5x–10x. Unwinding a $1B carry position can require dumping $5B–$10B in assets-often U.S. tech-to repay funding. By contrast, a domestic buyer stepping in after a 25 bp rate cut is typically buying cash, 1:1. The math is brutal: it can take ten domestic buyers to absorb the damage from one carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is extreme. Convergence Is What Kills the Trade Remember: the carry trade is pure arbitrage. It exists only because of a wide rate divergence between the U.S. and Japan. Wide gap: feels like free money-everyone piles in. Gap closing (convergence): the free money vanishes. Crucially, U.S. rate cuts don’t relieve the pressure-they intensify it. Returns are squeezed on the U.S. side while funding costs rise as the BoJ tightens. This isn’t a gentle “meeting in the middle”; it’s a pincer movement.",

They ’ re not_selling U.S. equities by choice they ’ re selling because margin calls leave them no_alternative . These are forced liquidations . Cash is needed immediately so they hit the bid at any price . The Domestic Buyer Optional and Patient Yes U.S. rate cuts are supportive for equities over time . But domestic investors are not_compelled to buy today . Watching markets fall amid a carry unwind their instinct is to wait “ Let ’ s see where the bottom is. ” The result A surge of “ sellatanyprice ” orders and a vacuum of “ buynow ” demand . Liquidity disappears an air pocket forms and prices freefall . The 10x Multiplier Effect Carry trades are rarely 11 with cash . They ’ re highly leveraged often 5x–10x . Unwinding a $ 1B carry position can require dumping $ 5B– $ 10B in assetsoften U.S. techto repay funding . By contrast a domestic buyer stepping in after a 25 bp rate cut is typically buying cash 11 . The math is brutal it can take ten domestic buyers to absorb the damage from one carry trader blowing up . The volume mismatch is extreme . Convergence Is What Kills the Trade Remember the carry trade is pure arbitrage . It exists only because of a wide rate divergence between the U.S. and Japan . Wide gap feels like free moneyeveryone piles in . Gap closing convergence the free money vanishes . Crucially U.S. rate cuts don ’ t relieve the pressurethey intensify it . Returns are squeezed on the U.S. side while funding costs rise as the BoJ tightens . This isn ’ t a gentle “ meeting in the middle ” it ’ s a pincer movement ."

      "selftext": "Did AVGO's stock performance scare you? A perfectly good AI stock, and it dropped over 15% after the earnings report! Those analysts say it's because of profit margin dilution to hell with profit margins! This is panic selling, and it's a gift for those of us who dare to gamble. NVIDIA sells the shovels, but AVGO is the arms dealer that supplies parts to NVIDIA. It has secured the biggest clients: Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all frantically ordering custom chips and fiber optic connectors from AVGO. While the whole world is mining for AI, AVGO has a monopoly on selling the most expensive tools to the miners. It has a cash cow: Forget about those AI concept stocks, AVGO also has a large software business (VMware), which is like a money-printing machine. CEO Hock Tan, a ruthless operator, is implementing massive layoffs and price increases at VMware. He's not doing charity; he's aggressively squeezing out profits and using that money to buy back shares or pay out more dividends. In short: Bought at $340, the $400 target price is just the beginning. Now, I need your \"insider information.\" The only thing I'm unsure about is what big move this old fox, Hock Tan, is really planning. The market is saying that the layoffs after the VMware integration will be massive, and the internal situation is very chaotic. That's the key to truly unlocking massive profits. Does anyone work at AVGO or VMware? Tell me: how many people did your company actually lay off? Do those who were laid off have any juicy internal gossip to share? Did Hock Tan lay off employees to save money, or because of problems with the integration? A real insider scoop would help me feel more confident about my $400 bet! If you have any \"hot tips\" or \"inside information\" about the VMware restructuring, please leave a comment below. I'm not seeking any financial advice; I'm just a retail investor who wants to hear some inside stories and confirm whether my AVGO bet is sound.",

      "selftext": "Waymo quietly extended its lead in the robotaxi space in 2025 and is now operating, testing, or preparing launches across 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad. At this point, it’s the only player running large-scale, fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities, which gives it a meaningful real-world data advantage. Amazon’s Zoox is taking a different approach, starting with limited public access. It’s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods, signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously. Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the Bay Area, but as of mid-December those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors. That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now. Overall, the gap between “driverless demos” and fully autonomous, scaled operations is becoming clearer. Waymo looks firmly in front today, while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles. Source:",

At this point it ’ s the only player running largescale fully driverless commercial services in multiple cities which gives it a meaningful realworld data advantage . Amazon ’ s Zoox is taking a different approach starting with limited public access . It ’ s begun offering free driverless rides around parts of the Las Vegas Strip and select San Francisco neighborhoods signaling confidence in its tech but still moving cautiously . Tesla has entered the conversation with a Robotaxibranded service in Austin and the Bay Area but as of midDecember those vehicles still rely on human drivers or safety supervisors . That puts Tesla more in a pilot phase than true autonomy for now . Overall the gap between “ driverless demos ” and fully autonomous scaled operations is becoming clearer . Waymo looks firmly in front today while Zoox and Tesla are progressing just on very different timelines and risk profiles . Source"

      "selftext": "Oracle has been sold off hard and in my view this is an oversold situation rather than a broken business. The stock has taken a sharp hit after earnings due to aggressive AI related capex and debt concerns, but the reaction looks excessive relative to what actually changed. First, I fully acknowledge the risk. Oracle is spending heavily. Data center buildout and AI infrastructure are expensive and the near term impact on free cash flow is real. That concern is valid and I am not ignoring it. Overspending is a legitimate risk and it deserves scrutiny. That said, risk does not automatically mean the stock is fairly priced at current levels. What I think the market is missing is Oracle’s positioning around enterprise data. Oracle databases sit under massive amounts of structured, regulated, and mission critical data across enterprises. As companies move toward building custom AI models on their own proprietary data, that data layer matters. You cannot train or fine tune serious enterprise models without clean, structured, governed data. Oracle already owns that layer for many companies. That gives them a real strategic position even if AI monetization takes time. Multiple market commentators have pointed out that the selloff appears sentiment driven rather than reflective of a collapse in the underlying business. Recent coverage on CNBC and Bloomberg has focused on debt and capex timing rather than any fundamental deterioration in Oracle’s core database or software demand. The concern is execution and cash flow timing, not relevance. From a technical standpoint, I entered in the 180s. That level previously acted as resistance in November 2024. Former resistance often becomes support once it is broken and revisited. We are now sitting around that same zone. If that level holds, it supports the idea that this move is an overshoot rather than the start of a long term breakdown. I am not married to the company or the CEO. I do not think Oracle is going to rip like Nvidia. I do think the market priced in worst case execution, persistent overspend, and credit stress all at once. That combination pushed the stock into oversold territory. This is not a blind bullish take. It is a view that risk is already well priced in and that Oracle’s data and database position still matters in an AI driven enterprise world. Open to pushback.",

The stock has taken a sharp hit after earnings due to aggressive AI related capex and debt concerns but the reaction looks excessive relative to what actually changed . First I fully acknowledge the risk . Oracle is spending heavily . Data center buildout and AI infrastructure are expensive and the near term impact on free cash flow is real . That concern is valid and I am not_ignoring it . Overspending is a legitimate risk and it deserves scrutiny . That said risk does not_automatically mean the stock is fairly priced at current levels . What I think the market is missing is Oracle ’ s positioning around enterprise data . Oracle databases sit under massive amounts of structured regulated and mission critical data across enterprises . As companies move toward building custom AI models on their own proprietary data that data layer matters . You can not train or fine tune serious enterprise models without clean structured governed data . Oracle already owns that layer for many companies . That gives them a real strategic position even if AI monetization takes time . Multiple market commentators have pointed out that the selloff appears sentiment driven rather than reflective of a collapse in the underlying business . Recent coverage on CNBC and Bloomberg has focused on debt and capex timing rather than any fundamental deterioration in Oracle ’ s core database or software demand . The concern is execution and cash flow timing not_relevance . From a technical standpoint I entered in the 180s . That level previously acted as resistance in November 2024 . Former resistance often becomes support once it is broken and revisited . We are now sitting around that same zone . If that level holds it supports the idea that this move is an overshoot rather than the start of a long term breakdown . I am not_married to the company or the CEO . I do not_think Oracle is going to rip like Nvidia . I do think the market priced in worst case execution persistent overspend and credit stress all at once . That combination pushed the stock into oversold territory . This is not_a blind bullish take . It is a view that risk is already well priced in and that Oracle ’ s data and database position still matters in an AI driven enterprise world . Open to pushback ."

The app will focus heavily on Reels, essentially bringing Instagram’s short-form video feed into a living-room format. According to Instagram VP of Product Tessa Lyons, this is just the first step. Meta plans to expand the TV app to other streaming platforms and device makers over time, depending on how users respond. It’s an interesting move considering how much time people already spend watching short-form video on phones. Meta seems to be testing whether that behavior translates to a lean-back experience similar to YouTube on TVs, and also whether Reels can compete for attention in a space traditionally dominated by longer content. Curious to see if this gains traction or if short-form video still ends up feeling better suited for mobile screens. Source:",

      "selftext": "Oil has been under steady pressure this year, and it doesn’t seem to be coming from just one factor. OPEC+ has been adding supply back into the market faster than many expected after years of disciplined output cuts, and that extra production is starting to show up in inventories and price action. At the same time, the geopolitical risk premium that supported crude over the past couple of years is slowly deflating. Markets are increasingly pricing in the possibility of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, or at least a less volatile outlook, which reduces fears around supply disruptions tied to the conflict. Put together, it’s a tough setup for oil bulls: more barrels coming online while the “fear bid” fades. Demand hasn’t collapsed, but it hasn’t been strong enough to absorb the new supply without pressure on prices. Curious how others are thinking about this is this just a cyclical oversupply phase, or does it mark a longer period of capped oil prices if geopolitics cool and OPEC+ prioritizes volume over price?

The company focused on Android users before, which aligned very well with earlier market strategy. But now the management is shifting into a higher quality traffic. IOS expansion is a good strategy to have higher ARPU users in North America and Europe. In their Q3, ad requests from SDK networks increased by 230% YoY. At the same time, JOYY invested in AI driven ad. These capabilities improve advertiser ROI and help with high value clients in the long run. The AdTech market is expected to grow in the future. In parallel, JOYY is building its ecommerce SaaS business. Overall if their BIGO can maintain 20-25% growth rate, their revenue mix could look different in the next few years. If that happens, a re-rating makes sense on paper, but execution here matters a lot.",

      "selftext": "Nvidia had a pretty packed news cycle today, and taken together it helps explain why sentiment around the stock remains resilient despite all the macro and valuation noise. On the policy side, Nvidia reportedly received approval to sell advanced chips into China, albeit with the U.S. government taking a sizable cut of the revenue. While the margin impact matters, access to China at all especially for higher-end products is still meaningful given how important that market is for AI demand. It also signals that Nvidia continues to navigate export restrictions better than many expected. Investor confidence was also reinforced by reports that heavyweight investors like David Tepper and Dan Loeb increased their Nvidia positions. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but it does suggest that some very sophisticated money still sees upside or at least durable dominance ahead. From an execution standpoint, Nvidia’s acquisition of SchedMD strengthens its AI infrastructure and scheduling stack, which ties directly into CUDA and large-scale GPU deployments. Alongside that, the launch of new Nemotron AI models and partnerships to improve security on BlueField DPUs point to Nvidia continuing to push deeper into software and platform-level control, not just selling chips. Finally, Bank of America reiterated Nvidia as a top pick heading into 2026 with a $275 price target, framing the company as still central to global AI buildouts. Put together, it’s the same recurring theme: Nvidia isn’t standing still. Even with regulatory friction, high expectations, and crowded trades, the company keeps expanding its moat across hardware, software, and infrastructure. Whether that’s fully priced in or not is the real debate but the strategic momentum is hard to ignore.",

      "selftext": "Microsoft continues to double down on AI infrastructure, including a massive Nvidia cloud contract and a multi-year investment commitment in India. From a balance sheet and execution standpoint, nothing here is surprising MSFT can afford to play offense longer than almost anyone. What stands out is a recent survey suggesting AI platform usage may be slowing, at least marginally. That doesn’t mean the strategy is wrong, but it does raise questions about timing and ROI. Spending is happening now, while monetization may still be uneven across products. The stock often trades as a “safe AI proxy,” but these signals suggest investors may start differentiating between infrastructure buildout and actual demand sooner than expected.",

From a balance sheet and execution standpoint nothing_here is surprising MSFT can afford to play offense longer than almost anyone . What stands out is a recent survey suggesting AI platform usage may be slowing at least marginally . That doesn ’ t mean the strategy is wrong but it does raise questions about timing and ROI . Spending is happening now while monetization may still be uneven across products . The stock often trades as a “ safe AI proxy ” but these signals suggest investors may start differentiating between infrastructure buildout and actual demand sooner than expected ."

      "selftext": "Tesla’s market cap has pushed up toward ~$1.6T as analysts raise price targets, largely tied to optimism around robotaxis and autonomy. The narrative hasn’t changed much: long-term optionality from autonomy versus near-term pressure from slowing sales, vandalism issues, and margin compression. What’s interesting is how little the market seems to care about current delivery softness compared to future possibilities. EU approval for Model Y L and demonstrations of driverless deliveries are being treated as validation points, even though full commercial rollout is still uncertain. At this point, Tesla feels less like an auto stock and more like a long-dated bet on software, robotics, and regulation moving in the right direction. The valuation assumes a lot goes right the debate is whether that optionality deserves to be priced in now or later.",

      "selftext": "What stands out here is not one headline. It is repetition. Over the last stretch, Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary. Domperidone was approved, followed by doxycycline, and then Pravastatin. For a microcap pharma, clearing even one approval can take years. Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works, not a lucky break. Each of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand. That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue, not distant milestones. This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings, while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M. Despite that, SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range. That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not matter financially. Historically, chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution. Do your own research.",

Over the last stretch Sunshine Biopharma has cleared three separate Health Canada approvals through its Canadian subsidiary . Domperidone was approved followed by doxycycline and then Pravastatin . For a microcap pharma clearing even one approval can take years . Clearing three in sequence points to a system that works not_a lucky break . Each of these products is a standard prescription generic with established demand . That matters because approvals translate directly into sellable inventory and recurring revenue not_distant milestones . This builds on an existing base where the company is already generating more than 37M in annual revenue per recent filings while the entire market cap sits around 6 to 7M . Despite that SBFM still trades near the 1 dollar range . That pricing suggests the market is either ignoring the approvals or assuming they do not_matter financially . Historically chains of approvals tend to matter more than isolated wins because they signal execution . Do your own research ."

      "selftext": "Hello, I have a question. This is the first year I was trying to tax loss harvest but ran into something confusing. From my understanding the basics of a wash sale is it is triggered if you sell a stock at a loss and then rebuy within 30 days or buy a stock and sell it within 30 days. Backstory I had like 200.076 shares all at a loss I am planning to offload this month, and have 2 covered calls at the strike price I want to sell it at (just to get some extra money). I sold the .076 shares to just have 200 shares today (was bugging me seeing that, also i have drip turned off now) but realized that may have messed up my tax loss plan. If my covered calls get assigned will I still be good at being able to use that loss to deduct or did I screw myself over? I may just be overthinking I just couldn’t find any posts about a similar scenario. When I googled it Google said “Selling a stock at a loss twice within a 30-day period triggers the wash-sale rule for the second loss, disallowing you from claiming that loss for tax purposes in the current year.” Does that mean my 200 share loss will be washed?….",

      "selftext": "There is a reflex reaction in small-cap trading where people hear the word biotech and immediately assume no revenue and constant dilution. That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM. Sunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M, yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales. That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range, many of which generate no commercial revenue at all. This revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary, not from speculative trial assets. The company has been expanding its product lineup, which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline. That does not remove risk, but it changes the conversation. When a stock trades as if the business does not exist, even basic awareness can shift sentiment. In low-float names, that shift does not require perfect fundamentals, only consistency and visibility.

That shortcut breaks down when you actually look at SBFM . Sunshine Biopharma currently carries a market cap around 6M yet recent numbers point to more than 37M in annual revenue based on reported quarterly results and product sales . That alone separates it from the majority of Nasdaq biotechs in this range many of which generate no_commercial revenue at all . This revenue is coming from approved generic drugs sold through its Canadian subsidiary not_from speculative trial assets . The company has been expanding its product lineup which suggests ongoing execution rather than a stalled pipeline . That does not_remove risk but it changes the conversation . When a stock trades as if the business does not_exist even basic awareness can shift sentiment . In lowfloat names that shift does not_require perfect fundamentals only consistency and visibility .

      "selftext": "In January 2023, when market sentiment for crypto equities was very negative, I initiated a portfolio of a basket of beaten-down names. One such name was Coinbase Global ($COIN). I initiated a position buying 1,850 shares, mostly in the mid-$30s, when the stock price was implying worst-case scenarios. The original thesis was never about growth; it was about survivability and operational leverage. The volumes in crypto had cratered, there was a lot of regulatory risk, but Coinbase had a strong balance sheet, was rapidly cutting costs, and was the most well-regulated and friendly-way-of-entering-the-crypto-market in the U.S. Fast-forward to today, and it looks like a vastly different market. Prices and activity are strong, institutional participation has risen substantially, and the earnings power of Coinbase showed exactly what kind of operating leverage had fixed costs. It re-rated sharply from distressed prices. However, at current prices, rather than pricing survival, it’s pricing adoption and domination across the crypto space. Currently, trading commissions are generating most of the revenue, and this indicates a highly cyclical nature of the business despite improved subscription and service revenue. To be honest, I’m not as committed anymore. My gut is starting to lean toward exiting the trade rather than holding through another full cycle. The easy money was made when sentiment was broken; now it feels more like a risk vs reward decision. Anyyy counter arguments, facts or datapoints to change my mind...???",

One such name was Coinbase Global $ COIN . I initiated a position buying 1850 shares mostly in the mid $ 30s when the stock price was implying worstcase scenarios . The original thesis was never_about growth it was about survivability and operational leverage . The volumes in crypto had cratered there was a lot of regulatory risk but Coinbase had a strong balance sheet was rapidly cutting costs and was the most wellregulated and friendlywayofenteringthecryptomarket in the U.S. Fastforward to today and it looks like a vastly different market . Prices and activity are strong institutional participation has risen substantially and the earnings power of Coinbase showed exactly what kind of operating leverage had fixed costs . It rerated sharply from distressed prices . However at current prices rather than pricing survival it ’ s pricing adoption and domination across the crypto space . Currently trading commissions are generating most of the revenue and this indicates a highly cyclical nature of the business despite improved subscription and service revenue . To be honest I ’ m not_as committed anymore . My gut is starting to lean toward exiting the trade rather than holding through another full cycle . The easy money was made when sentiment was broken now it feels more like a risk vs reward decision . Anyyy counter arguments facts or datapoints to change my mind ..."

I did some minor tax loss harvesting on some stocks that’ll take maybe $300-$400 off? Single filer in the 24% tax bracket.

I mention this as a W-2 employee with a side hustle income (I do tax withholding via W4 for my freelancing) Can someone help me understand how to estimate my taxes for the below if I sell now? Federal is fine. I don’t know if PA will tax as well. But just want to make sure I set enough $$ aside. And also….can I then use those funds towards my Roth IRA in 2026? Anyways…..should I do the above or just keep as is and eat it later? I know it’s not a lot of money but just good learning for me as I continue my investing journey and prep for 2026.",

      "selftext": "Waymo grew its lead in the robotaxi market in 2025, and is now operating, planning to launch a service or testing its vehicles in 26 markets in the U.S. and abroad. Amazon’s Zoox began offering free driverless rides to the public around the Las Vegas Strip and certain San Francisco neighborhoods. Tesla launched a Robotaxi-branded service in Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area, but those cars still had human drivers or safety supervisors on board as of mid-December. Robotaxis felt like science fiction just a decade ago, but this year, autonomous vehicles became a commonplace option for paying passengers across big cities in the U.S. and parts of Asia. Alphabet-owned Waymo kept expanding and dominates the robotaxi market in the U.S., though rivals Tesla and Amazon-owned Zoox also launched the first versions of their services in 2025. Meanwhile, Baidu-owned Apollo Go dominated in China. Some parents are now sending teens to schools and activities in Waymos, and women often praise the privacy of these AVs versus rides with strangers who drive for ride-hailing and traditional taxi services. Additionally, the company has begun testing vehicles in New York and Tokyo, two of the most dense cities in which Waymo has started driving. The company hasn’t yet specified service launch timelines for those markets. Waymo, in particular, has been so successful in its commercial expansion that Tesla CEO Elon Musk acknowledged his rival’s achievements after previously criticizing the Google sister company. At Tesla’s annual meeting on Nov. 6, Musk thanked Waymo for “paving the path here” when it comes to working out the regulatory approvals that allow robotaxi services to do business across much of the U.S. In 2026, Waymo plans to open service in Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Miami, Nashville, Orlando, San Antonio, San Diego and Washington, D.C. The company also announced plans to launch its service in London in 2026, which will mark Waymo’s first overseas service region. Waymo leads the 2025 robotaxi surge as Zoox expands and Tesla races to catch up",

      "selftext": "I find myself with $100,000 USD in my bank account. I've never had this much money before. I'm 30 with very minimal investments. I'd like to best use this as my first big step towards eventual financial independence (hopefully). I have about $10,000 left in student debt (interest free). No other debt. I have a mid 700 credit score. I commonly see 3 similar investment methods that are recommended. 1. 100% VOO. Something about Jack Bogle saying US. stock are international because those companies operate internally. 2. VTI one and done. I believe 15% international exposure. 3. VOO and VXUS so you can rebalance if seen necessary. Far be it from me to believe I could determine a more optimized \"split\" than is offered in VTI. I'm fairly young. I can handle the volatility. I personally don't see the need to have bonds in my portfolio at the moment. Am I on the right track? Would you steer me towards one of these three options, or somewhere else entirely? Your input is much appreciated.",

Something about Jack Bogle saying US . stock are international because those companies operate internally . 2 . VTI one and done . I believe 15 % international exposure . 3 . VOO and VXUS so you can rebalance if seen necessary . Far be it from me to believe I could determine a more optimized split than is offered in VTI . Im fairly young . I can handle the volatility . I personally dont see the need to have bonds in my portfolio at the moment . Am I on the right track Would you steer me towards one of these three options or somewhere else entirely Your input is much appreciated ."

      "title": "WW International Inc. - Expected to benefit from the GLP-1 trend",
      "selftext": "Hi guys, I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc. I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand I'm not allowed to share it here. For refernce, I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing, the niche I am trying to master are distressed / turnaround equties. I'm still relatively new to writing and valuation so I'd appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals. Shares currently trading at $24.28 per share, based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $35.52 per share and a price of $47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario. WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70% of their debt from \\~$1.6 billion to a manageable \\~$466 million. Leverage based on $145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x post-emergence to previously being at 11x. Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline, however their clinical segment is growing aggresively. They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x, I feel like with the reduced leverage, high growth in the clinical segment, and cash generation, WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $52.18 per share. They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk, which protects them from litigation risk. The GLP-1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal. Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies, and the FDA has issued warnings. Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 (pre-bankruptcy) seeing the company as a deep value opportunity. Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not meet the criteria for insolvency, making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders. Galloway believes that there was no exigency to WW’s bankruptcy filing, considering that the overwhelming majority of WW’s funded debt is not due until 2028 and 2029, and WW’s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest. There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga, check it out [here]( Get this, if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x, what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses. Additionally, in Bankruptcy law, there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S-1 registration statement with the SEC. In 99% of distress-for-control deals, the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement (RRA) in the bankruptcy proceedings. I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not find a RRA. Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91% control. It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights. The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround (1-2 years) rather than flipping it immediately (especially considering Galloway’s interest). There was a post on VIC on WW in June, when shares were trading at \\~$40, the writer's estimate was around \\~$65-$75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I would've missed or are incorrect. Thank you!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi guys I wanted to share my thoughts on WW International Inc . I wrote a detailed deep dive but I understand Im not_allowed to share it here . For refernce I am a 22 year old fascinated with the world of investing the niche I am trying to master are distressed turnaround equties . Im still relatively new to writing and valuation so Id appreciate any advice from more seasonsed professionals . Shares currently trading at $ 24.28 per share based on my valuation models I get a target price using conservative estimates of $ 35.52 per share and a price of $ 47.17 per share in a more bullish scenario . WW recently emerged from bankruptcy wiping out 70 % of their debt from $ 1.6 billion to a manageable $ 466 million . Leverage based on $ 145 million adjusted EBITDA is 3.2x postemergence to previously being at 11x . Their legacy behaviroul segment is in a decline however their clinical segment is growing aggresively . They are currently trading at a EBITDA multiple of 3.8x I feel like with the reduced leverage high growth in the clinical segment and cash generation WW at least deserves a 6x multiple which would put the share price at $ 52.18 per share . They have ditched their offering for compounded sema and struck partnerships with both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk which protects them from litigation risk . The GLP1 shortage has ended which means that compounded sema is illegal . Novo Nordisk is currently suing these companies and the FDA has issued warnings . Galloway Capital started building a position in WW in around 2024 prebankruptcy seeing the company as a deep value opportunity . Bruce Galloway said that WW still has solid fundamentals and does not_meet the criteria for insolvency making a bankruptcy filing both unwarranted and damaging to equity holders . Galloway believes that there was no_exigency to WW ’ s bankruptcy filing considering that the overwhelming majority of WW ’ s funded debt is not_due until 2028 and 2029 and WW ’ s funded debt has favourable interest rates as compared to current market rates of interest . There is a pretty nice article from Yahoo Finance on this whole saga check it out here Get this if Galloway was so confident about WW with a leverage ratio of 11x what do you think WW has in store now with reduced debt and interest expenses . Additionally in Bankruptcy law there is an exemption under Section 1145 which allows companies emerging from Chapter 11 to issue new securities to creditors and existing shareholders without filing a Form S1 registration statement with the SEC . In 99 % of distressforcontrol deals the lenders demand a Registration Rights Agreement RRA in the bankruptcy proceedings . I looked at all the relevant SEC and Chapter 11 fillings I could not_find a RRA . Seems highly unusual for a lender group taking 91 % control . It seems counterintuitive for powerful lenders to give up these rights . The potential reason I see is that the lenders might genuinely intend to hold the asset for a turnaround 12 years rather than flipping it immediately especially considering Galloway ’ s interest . There was a post on VIC on WW in June when shares were trading at $ 40 the writers estimate was around $ 65 $ 75 I would love to hear the communities thoughts on this and people can potentially point out things I wouldve missed or are incorrect . Thank you"

      "title": "Meta: Metaverse Cuts Are Not The Story. How It Affects AI Spend Is",
      "selftext": "# Introduction The reported cuts to the Reality Labs’ budget have likely been overstated. First, it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect. Will it just be VR and the Metaverse, or will augmented reality (smart glasses) be included? Reports are of 10% and 30% cuts. Again, how will this be spread out? If we assume it is 30% of the entirety of Reality Labs, which I don’t believe. With expenses of \\~$16 billion, that would be over $4 billion in cuts. But remember, Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $116-$118 billion in 2025, which will accelerate in 2026. $4 billion is not all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI. This metaverse cut is not that big of a deal. What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas’ willingness to cut it back if needed. Therefore, I see two likely outcomes for Meta. One, Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI, or two, AI will be a success and the high spend will continue. Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases, I find Meta to be good value in either scenario. I get a weighted valuation of $950. Image: Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasn't able to add images, you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them. Oh, I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was auto-blocking the post, I think. # Zuckerberg's Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg’s willingness to change should not have come as a massive surprise. There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerberg's career where he has shown this flexibility. In 2008, he embraced advertising, something he had long had doubts about, brought in Cheryl Sandberg, and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘Adult in the room’. Around 2010, Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a web-based platform without the need for a dedicated app. When that was proven wrong, they pivoted. Before long, they had one of the most popular apps in the world. And of course, more recently, they went all in on the metaverse, even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021. Then, in the 2022 Q4 report, they announced the ‘year of efficiency’. I see last week's reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction. It is this history that gives me, and I believe some of the market, faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not generating the desired returns. # Two Scenarios To help me value the company, I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them. Scenario 1, AI returns do not appear, and cuts in CapEx are needed. Scenario 2, AI leads to increased revenue. **Scenario 1: Cuts to AI spend** Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business. Most analysts expect over 15% growth in the next 12 months. In this scenario, I'm going to assume it ends there. Algorithms are as optimised as they can get, there are no more efficiencies to find, and no new AI revenue sources appear. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 1: Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8%, which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5%. This may seem high given a failed AI pivot, but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media. Ad spend is still migrating to online, the world, especially outside the US, is getting richer, and there is no reason to think that Meta will not continue to grow for the foreseeable future. As we discussed in his history, I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend. Barring any writedown, this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books. I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current \\~40% to a terminal margin of 49%. And for the terminal reinvestment, I'm assuming a return on invested capital of 20%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together. I get a valuation of $861. So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout, there is a case for Meta to be good value. With that said, it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation, which could allow for an even more attractive entry. # Scenario 2: AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model. I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI, both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI. I am modelling them to have 20% growth, trailing off to 15% in 4 years, and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5%. Image: DCF Model For Scenario 2: AI Moderate Success To support this growth, I am continuing the high CapEx spend, but with that said, I am assuming that the costs are front-loaded and relative to revenue, CapEx will actually fail. I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady, with a terminal rate of 37%. For the terminal reinvestment, I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15%. Image: Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $1,115. Of course, there is plenty of room in this 'AI moderate success' scenario for more upside. I see this as a conservative valuation. # Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model, I like to get a weighted average between them, which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood. While I believe AI will be transformational, I'm not convinced Meta will be the one to build it. For that reason, I'm putting ‘reduced CapEx’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65% weighting. When it comes to AI, if a company wants to be successful, it will need piles of money, abundant sources of data, and a willingness to go for it. Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that. I am putting a weighting of 35% on the ‘AI moderately successful’ scenario. Image: Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail. It is black or white, but I do like to work in the grey middle, so for my overall valuation, I will be using this weighted average of $950. Given the different potential outcomes, it will be important to regularly update this model and my $950 valuation. For now, I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock. # Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his super-voting rights. And while in the past he's shown a willingness to change direction. A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person. If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him, there is not much we can do As with any international company, there will be regulation and antitrust risk. From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban, there is a constant risk on this front. If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be, there is no valuation model, no company, and perhaps no industry that is safe. # Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not the real story here. The real story is that once again, Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed. The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net. If AI succeeds, great, shareholders will reap the rewards. If it fails, Zuckerberg will cut his losses, rightsize the company, and continue to run the world's largest social media empire. \\---------------------------------------- Check out my Substack for more valuations like this.",

      "selftext_processed": "Introduction The reported cuts to the Reality Labs ’ budget have likely been overstated . First it is unclear how big the cuts are and which part of Reality Labs they affect . Will it just be VR and the Metaverse or will augmented reality smart glasses be included Reports are of 10 % and 30 % cuts . Again how will this be spread out If we assume it is 30 % of the entirety of Reality Labs which I don ’ t believe . With expenses of $ 16 billion that would be over $ 4 billion in cuts . But remember Meta is expected to have expenses in the range of $ 116 $ 118 billion in 2025 which will accelerate in 2026 . $ 4 billion is not_all that significant compared to the massive spend on AI . This metaverse cut is not_that big of a deal . What is important is what it tells us about the AI spend and Metas ’ willingness to cut it back if needed . Therefore I see two likely outcomes for Meta . One Mark Zuckerberg will reduce spend in the face of weak demand for AI or two AI will be a success and the high spend will continue . Doing a discounted cash flow valuation on both cases I find Meta to be good value in either scenario . I get a weighted valuation of $ 950 . Image Reality Labs Revenue And Expenses I wasnt able to add images you can search the same title for my Substack post to see them . Oh I had to take out the reference links as Reddit was autoblocking the post I think . Zuckerbergs Willingness To Change Mark Zuckerberg ’ s willingness to change should not_have come as a massive surprise . There are multiple examples throughout Zuckerbergs career where he has shown this flexibility . In 2008 he embraced advertising something he had long had doubts about brought in Cheryl Sandberg and gave up a lot of operational control when it was felt they needed an ‘ Adult in the room ’ . Around 2010 Zuckerberg was all in on Facebook being a webbased platform without the need for a dedicated app . When that was proven wrong they pivoted . Before long they had one of the most popular apps in the world . And of course more recently they went all in on the metaverse even changing the name of the company from Facebook to Meta in 2021 . Then in the 2022 Q4 report they announced the ‘ year of efficiency ’ . I see last weeks reports of cuts in the metaverse as a continuation of this change of direction . It is this history that gives me and I believe some of the market faith that Zuckerberg can change direction if it becomes clear that the massive AI spend is not_generating the desired returns . Two Scenarios To help me value the company I found it useful to think of two scenarios and do separate valuations for each of them . Scenario 1 AI returns do not_appear and cuts in CapEx are needed . Scenario 2 AI leads to increased revenue . Scenario 1 Cuts to AI spend Meta has been quite clear that AI has given tangible benefits to their underlying business . Most analysts expect over 15 % growth in the next 12 months . In this scenario Im going to assume it ends there . Algorithms are as optimised as they can get there are no_more efficiencies to find and no_new AI revenue sources appear . Image DCF Model For Scenario 1 Reduced CapEx I am modelling revenue falling back to a still respectable 8 % which will then trail off to a terminal growth rate of 5 % . This may seem high given a failed AI pivot but keep in mind the underlying business is still dominant in the world of social media . Ad spend is still migrating to online the world especially outside the US is getting richer and there is no_reason to think that Meta will not_continue to grow for the foreseeable future . As we discussed in his history I believe Zuckerberg will pivot in the face of an AI failure and reduce Capex and spend . Barring any writedown this will likely take a number of years as depreciation works its way through the books . I am modelling EBIT margin to rise from the current 40 % to a terminal margin of 49 % . And for the terminal reinvestment Im assuming a return on invested capital of 20 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Putting all these numbers together . I get a valuation of $ 861 . So even in the scenario of a failed AI buildout there is a case for Meta to be good value . With that said it is easy to see the stock selling off in that situation which could allow for an even more attractive entry . Scenario 2 AI is moderately successful AI succeeding is such a general statement that it is very difficult to model . I will assume their revenues remain higher for longer as they continue to reap the rewards of AI both in their core business and in any new business models that come from AI . I am modelling them to have 20 % growth trailing off to 15 % in 4 years and then trailing off to a terminal growth rate of 5.5 % . Image DCF Model For Scenario 2 AI Moderate Success To support this growth I am continuing the high CapEx spend but with that said I am assuming that the costs are frontloaded and relative to revenue CapEx will actually fail . I am modelling this as EBIT margins remaining fairly steady with a terminal rate of 37 % . For the terminal reinvestment I am assuming a return on invested capital of 15 % . Image Final DCF Calculations Adding all that up gets me to a valuation of $ 1115 . Of course there is plenty of room in this AI moderate success scenario for more upside . I see this as a conservative valuation . Combining The Models When I do more than one valuation model I like to get a weighted average between them which means we have to give each scenario a likelihood . While I believe AI will be transformational Im not_convinced Meta will be the one to build it . For that reason Im putting ‘ reduced CapEx ’ as the slightly more likely scenario and giving it a 65 % weighting . When it comes to AI if a company wants to be successful it will need piles of money abundant sources of data and a willingness to go for it . Zuckerberg and Meta have all of that . I am putting a weighting of 35 % on the ‘ AI moderately successful ’ scenario . Image Weighted Average Calculation AI will succeed or fail . It is black or white but I do like to work in the grey middle so for my overall valuation I will be using this weighted average of $ 950 . Given the different potential outcomes it will be important to regularly update this model and my $ 950 valuation . For now I am confident in placing a BUY target on the stock . Risks Zuckerberg has full control over Meta with his supervoting rights . And while in the past hes shown a willingness to change direction . A shareholder still has to accept that they are at the whims of one person . If he digs his heels in and says he will succeed in AI or take Meta down with him there is not_much we can do As with any international company there will be regulation and antitrust risk . From European Union fines to the Austrailian under 16 ban there is a constant risk on this front . If AI is as disruptive as many think it will be there is no_valuation model no_company and perhaps no_industry that is safe . Conclusion Meta giving up on the metaverse is not_the real story here . The real story is that once again Mark Zuckerberg has shown a willingness to change direction when needed . The market sees that willingness to change direction as a safety net . If AI succeeds great shareholders will reap the rewards . If it fails Zuckerberg will cut his losses rightsize the company and continue to run the worlds largest social media empire .

      "selftext": "1. Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers This is the main issue * The Carry Trader: When the Yen spikes (because the BoJ hiked), these guys are underwater immediately. They aren’t selling U.S. stocks because they *want* to; they are selling because they are getting margin called. They are forced sellers. They need cash T-minus now. They hit the bid, regardless of the price. * The Domestic Buyer: Sure, U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks. But if you're a domestic investor, you aren't forced to buy *today*. You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think, \"I'll wait for the bottom.\" So you have a flood of \"sell at any price\" orders and a total lack of \"buy right now\" orders. That creates an air pocket, and prices freefall. 2. The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never 1:1 with cash. They are highly leveraged, often 5x or 10x. If a fund unwinds a $1B carry trade, they might have to dump $5B to $10B worth of assets (like U.S. Tech stocks) to pay back the loan. A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25% rate cut is likely buying with cash (1:1). Math: It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is insane. 3. Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play. It only exists because there is a massive gap (divergence) between U.S. and JP rates. * Wide Gap: Free money. Everyone piles in. * Gap Closing (Convergence): The free money is gone. The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader. It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side. It’s not a \"meeting in the middle,\" it’s a pincer movement. TL;DR: Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains. Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire. One group is much faster and more violent than the other.",

They hit the bid regardless of the price . The Domestic Buyer Sure U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks . But if youre a domestic investor you arent forced to buy today . You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think Ill wait for the bottom . So you have a flood of sell at any price orders and a total lack of buy right now orders .

If a fund unwinds a $ 1B carry trade they might have to dump $ 5B to $ 10B worth of assets like U.S. Tech stocks to pay back the loan .

      "selftext": "TLDR: Altria is a deep value buy. The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood. The market doesn't see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers (largely young, non smokers) from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result. If On!’s growth follows historical and grows near 60% CAGR it will account for more than 75% of the company's oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20% of Altria’s total revenue in 2029 (versus a negligible 3% total total volume in 2024). Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. The market has overlooked on! as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altria's earning reports, guidance, and financials, but it doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altria's portfolio the market is going to **re-rate** the stock. [DCF]( Altria Group (MO) has a significant moat in the US cig market (45.8% of US Cigarette Market, 59.3% of US Premium Cigarette Market, 37.5% of US Smokeless Tobacco Market), but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever. And Altria's revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent. Cigs' share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60% in 2024 down from 90% in 2000. Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets (Altria operates only in the US in which \\~19% of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs \\~25% of Europeans 15 or olders). Altria's US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver (they sold IQOS system to PMI -> IQOS is the future of vapes) is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers. But Altria does have a growth driver, on! Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50% 2020-2024. on! currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70%. Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28%-50% through 2034 ($250B+ Market). on! trails behind Zyn but still controls 30% market share in a near duopolistic environment. The market (and even Altria itself) is completely ignoring on! because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altria's portfolio. on!’s numbers are buried in Altria’s financials and earnings reports, combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “pouches” segment; on! doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. In 2024 on! was only 20% of Altria’s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4% of revenue. If on!’s historical growth rate of 60% continues through 2029 on! will be 75% of Altria’s oral volume and 25% of total revenue. on!’s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not yet rated by the market. The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock, hoping all the while that the bleeding stops. Except not really. You're more than compensated for your time here. Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy (78.6% Payout). The company has committed up to $2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026, $1.3 billion remaining authorized. So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities. And despite falling revenues, margins continue to grow with no sight of slowing down. Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model, and as pouches scale, margins will widen there as well. In fact, the more we look at revenues broadly, the more it looks over played. Not only do they grow margins at every mark, if we excise tax is taken out from COGS, it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner. + if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood. The market sees this well observed declining trend (declining consumption of tobacco products) and views it as baked in and linear. They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed. But this is not the case. It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow. The bottom of the sentiment is in. Joe rogan says cigs are good for you. Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you. Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life. The evil tobacco barons of old couldn't have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke. The product is being authentically re-marketed to younger generations. & pouches growth is a manifestation of this. Pouches are not eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend, instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential. This implies significant customer acquisition to newer, non smoking, younger consumers. The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new, but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs. Some % (like 1 in 5) of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers, and in the US Altria controls 50% of the cig market, so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability, will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years. Regardless, the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US, indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced. I did a DCF which I've linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $78 with a MOS of 35%. I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions (bull v bear, see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on!). The DCF only affirmed the thesis. The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria’s product lines except on! fck it i just posted one of the DCFs (base case) cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go. Basically the DD shows **BUY** & hold Altria (MO) for 5 Years or until market re-rates the stock as on! becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria’s US cigarette moat.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Altria is a deep value buy . The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood . The market doesnt see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers largely young non smokers from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result . If On ’ s growth follows historical and grows near 60 % CAGR it will account for more than 75 % of the companys oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20 % of Altria ’ s total revenue in 2029 versus a negligible 3 % total total volume in 2024 . Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . The market has overlooked on as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altrias earning reports guidance and financials but it doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altrias portfolio the market is going to rerate the stock . DCF Altria Group MO has a significant moat in the US cig market 45.8 % of US Cigarette Market 59.3 % of US Premium Cigarette Market 37.5 % of US Smokeless Tobacco Market but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever . And Altrias revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent . Cigs share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60 % in 2024 down from 90 % in 2000 . Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets Altria operates only in the US in which 19 % of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs 25 % of Europeans 15 or olders . Altrias US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver they sold IQOS system to PMI IQOS is the future of vapes is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers . But Altria does have a growth driver on Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50 % 20202024. on currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70 % . Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28 % 50 % through 2034 $ 250B Market . on trails behind Zyn but still controls 30 % market share in a near duopolistic environment . The market and even Altria itself is completely ignoring on because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altrias portfolio . on ’ s numbers are buried in Altria ’ s financials and earnings reports combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “ pouches ” segment on doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . In 2024 on was only 20 % of Altria ’ s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4 % of revenue . If on ’ s historical growth rate of 60 % continues through 2029 on will be 75 % of Altria ’ s oral volume and 25 % of total revenue . on ’ s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not_yet rated by the market . The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock hoping all the while that the bleeding stops . Except not_really . Youre more than compensated for your time here . Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy 78.6 % Payout . The company has committed up to $ 2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026 $ 1.3 billion remaining authorized . So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities . And despite falling revenues margins continue to grow with no_sight of slowing down . Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model and as pouches scale margins will widen there as well . In fact the more we look at revenues broadly the more it looks over played . Not_only do they grow margins at every mark if we excise tax is taken out from COGS it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner . if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood . The market sees this well observed declining trend declining consumption of tobacco products and views it as baked in and linear . They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed . But this is not_the case . It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow . The bottom of the sentiment is in . Joe rogan says cigs are good for you . Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you . Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life . The evil tobacco barons of old couldnt have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke . The product is being authentically remarketed to younger generations . pouches growth is a manifestation of this . Pouches are not_eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential . This implies significant customer acquisition to newer non smoking younger consumers . The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs . Some % like 1 in 5 of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers and in the US Altria controls 50 % of the cig market so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years . Regardless the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced . I did a DCF which Ive linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $ 78 with a MOS of 35 % . I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions bull v bear see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on . The DCF only affirmed the thesis . The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria ’ s product lines except on fck it i just posted one of the DCFs base case cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go . Basically the DD shows BUY hold Altria MO for 5 Years or until market rerates the stock as on becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria ’ s US cigarette moat .

      "title": "DD: McDonald's MCD - Burger Joint Is About to Print Money",
      "selftext": "**TLDR**: McDonald's isn't a fast-food company. It's a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers. With 185 million loyalty users, an AI-powered digital transformation, a plan to add 10,000 restaurants by 2027, and 82% operating margins on franchise income, this \"boring boomer stock\" is about to break out. Stock is trading at $316 near all-time highs and analysts have a $335 target. I think $400+ is in play by end of 2026. \"We Are Not in the Food Business\" Listen up, you degenerate casino patrons. I know what you're thinking - \"MCD? Really? My grandma owns that stock.\" Well guess what? Your grandma is smarter than you, and she's been collecting 2.24% dividends while you've been bag-holding whatever garbage stock some Discord \"guru\" told you to buy. But here's what most people don't understand about McDonald's. Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said: \"We are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.\" That's right. McDonald's is essentially a $42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism. The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps. The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued: The Real Estate Empire McDonald's owns ~45% of the land and ~70% of the buildings where its 43,000+ restaurants operate $42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93% of restaurants are franchised - meaning McDonald's just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4% royalties PLUS 8-15% of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue: 82% (compared to ~16% on company-operated stores) Let that sink in. When you buy a Big Mac, most of that profit doesn't come from the beef patty - it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonald's. They've turned fast food into a landlord simulator. 2024-2025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue: $7.078 billion (+3% YoY) Global comparable sales: +3.6% Systemwide sales: $131 billion across 43,000+ locations in 115 markets Market cap: ~$226 billion P/E ratio: 27 Dividend yield: 2.24% (they just raised it 6% in Q3 2024) Free cash flow machine - they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody Is Talking About: \"Digitizing the Arches\" Here's where it gets spicy. McDonald's isn't just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks. They're in the middle of a \"once-in-a-generation\" digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers: AI and Technology Deployment McDonald's partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out: Restaurant Platform Edge - Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling real-time AI and IoT. Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations. AI-Powered Accuracy Scales - Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave. Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets. Virtual AI Manager - Introduced January 2025. This thing schedules crews, audits food safety, handles predictive maintenance, and basically runs the restaurant. Drive-Thru AI - Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time, 10% more car throughput, and $65,000 additional annual revenue per store. Do the math: If they roll this out to even 20,000 locations, that's $1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drive-thrus. The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90-day active users (as of Q2 2025) Target: 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before That's a 147% increase in visits. They're not just selling burgers - they're building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies. And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat+ subscriptions. This isn't your grandfather's fast food chain. The Expansion Play: 50,000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonald's is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history: Opening ~2,200 new restaurants in 2025 Target: 50,000 total restaurants by end of 2027 (up from 43,000 today) 1,000 new stores in China alone in 2025 That's adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant = more rent, more royalties, more data for the AI systems. Why \"Boring\" = Tendies MCD has a beta of 0.52. That means when the market crashes, this thing barely moves. When your options portfolio is down 80%, McDonald's will be sitting there like a rock, paying dividends. Institutional ownership sits around 70-75% of shares DCFmodeling.com",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR McDonalds isnt a fastfood company . Its a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers . With 185 million loyalty users an AIpowered digital transformation a plan to add 10000 restaurants by 2027 and 82 % operating margins on franchise income this boring boomer stock is about to break out . Stock is trading at $ 316 near alltime highs and analysts have a $ 335 target . I think $ 400 is in play by end of 2026 . We Are Not_in the Food Business Listen up you degenerate casino patrons . I know what youre thinking MCD Really My grandma owns that stock . Well guess what Your grandma is smarter than you and shes been collecting 2.24 % dividends while youve been bagholding whatever garbage stock some Discord guru told you to buy . But heres what most people dont understand about McDonalds . Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said We are not_technically in the food business . We are in the real estate business . The only reason we sell fifteencent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent . Thats right . McDonalds is essentially a $ 42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism . The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps . The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued The Real Estate Empire McDonalds owns 45 % of the land and 70 % of the buildings where its 43000 restaurants operate $ 42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93 % of restaurants are franchised meaning McDonalds just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4 % royalties PLUS 815 % of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue 82 % compared to 16 % on companyoperated stores Let that sink in . When you buy a Big Mac most of that profit doesnt come from the beef patty it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonalds . Theyve turned fast food into a landlord simulator . 20242025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue $ 7.078 billion 3 % YoY Global comparable sales 3.6 % Systemwide sales $ 131 billion across 43000 locations in 115 markets Market cap $ 226 billion PE ratio 27 Dividend yield 2.24 % they just raised it 6 % in Q3 2024 Free cash flow machine they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody_Is Talking About Digitizing the Arches Heres where it gets spicy . McDonalds isnt just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks . Theyre in the middle of a onceinageneration digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers AI and Technology Deployment McDonalds partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out Restaurant Platform Edge Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling realtime AI and IoT . Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations . AIPowered Accuracy Scales Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave . Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets . Virtual AI Manager Introduced January 2025 . This thing schedules crews audits food safety handles predictive maintenance and basically runs the restaurant . DriveThru AI Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time 10 % more car throughput and $ 65000 additional annual revenue per store . Do the math If they roll this out to even 20000 locations thats $ 1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drivethrus . The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90day active users as of Q2 2025 Target 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before Thats a 147 % increase in visits .

      "title": "Demand on the Rise as Platinum hits $1800 for the First Time in 15 Years",
      "selftext": "On the morning of December 15 2025, the spot price of Platinum reached $1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011, as of now it doesn’t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day. With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market, coupled with a bright industrial future, investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin. The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected. As of writing this, Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals. It’s estimated to be 20-30x more rare than gold, and 140x more rare than silver. Despite that, it’s currently trading at a ratio of 27:1 with silver, and a ratio of 1:2.5 with gold. In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum, and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold. You can see, these numbers don’t really reflect the rarity. The reason for that; Supply and demand. People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not currently in high demand industrially, and fundamentally that is correct, but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists. Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it, why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen? Scarcity, because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC. Did you know that there’s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person? Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream, metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can, sparking an “altcoin season” in the undervalued precious metals. Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly. As of today, there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams, and there’s even less than that available to buy, due to industrial use and hoarding. Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person. We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram. If we can take anything away from this analysis, I hope it’s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie. This number doesn’t come from thin air. It’s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined. The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion. 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person. To put this into perspective, the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home. About 8-10 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually. But only 1.8-2.7 billion of that goes towards bullion. 40-45% of Platinum gets used in industrial production. 30-35% goes towards jewelry. 20-30% goes towards bullion. If 40% of all Platinum goes towards industrial use, out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million. That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment. But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion. Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names, I won’t be factoring them into this analysis. Doing the same math as before, 193 million divided by 8.3 billion, the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person. Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in. According to the World Platinum Investment Council, 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion. If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion, this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out. That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC. You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum. Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved. But it’s not just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum. South Africa is responsible for 70-80% of the world’s Platinum, Russia is 16% of the supply, and Zimbabwe is 8%. This is between 93-100% of the world’s total Platinum. There are other places that produce minor amounts, like Canada. But there’s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common, they are all facing major crisis. As far as what we are being told, Platinum production in Russia has not slowed down due to the war. If you aren’t in the know, South Africa and Zimbabwe are not doing so hot. From a volatile political climate, food and water shortages, and major power outages. Pick your poison. South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa. Zimbabwe is still in a bad way. Ultimately both countries have a long way to go. How do these crisis affect the Platinum price? With electricity being in short supply, it’s in high demand. High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum. Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance. This is the result; Platinum mines being shut down, delayed, and abandoned. All because the price of Platinum is too low. With recent rises in Platinum prices, the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned. But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them. I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses. As the supply problem persisted for many years, inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply. 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit, and 2025 saw a 700,000 ounce deficit. That, and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100% rise in Platinum this year. But it’s not the only precious metal doing good. Gold is up 65% this year, after a 40% rise in 2024, and silver is up 120% this year after a phenomenal 2024. There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors. They have begun to notice that the ratios don’t quite make sense. We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum. Not only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option, but so is the jewelry market. If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream, Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor’s price range. The reason for this is simple. The more rare something is, the quicker the total supply can be bought out, which leads to both faster and higher price hikes. This is most certainly a star aligning moment here. If enough retail investors join in this new trend, the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person. However it’s important to consider that in 2022-2023 China, India, and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum. I think it’s because of them that the Platinum market won’t collapse in 2026, after years of deficit, 2026 is projected to potentially break even. It certainly can’t be because of mining, it’s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100%. This is ultimately good for the retail investors though, as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply. With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells, AI semiconductors, cancer treatments, and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries; Future industrial investment is not only guaranteed, but it’s guaranteed to grow. But what happens when industry can no longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition? It gets priced out of retail. What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal. It wasn’t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties, and we still don’t fully understand these unique properties. This is why Platinum is changing the world, and it’s also why you can still afford it. Your kids might not be able to. There’s simply not enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand, and it’s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important. TLDR: Less than half a gram per person currently, a 700,000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023, an increase in bullion and jewelry demand, and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable. You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals, it’s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too.",

      "selftext_processed": "On the morning of December 15 2025 the spot price of Platinum reached $ 1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011 as of now it doesn ’ t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day . With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market coupled with a bright industrial future investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin . The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected . As of writing this Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals . It ’ s estimated to be 2030x more rare than gold and 140x more rare than silver . Despite that it ’ s currently trading at a ratio of 271 with silver and a ratio of 12.5 with gold . In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold . You can see these numbers don ’ t really reflect the rarity . The reason for that Supply and demand . People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not_currently in high demand industrially and fundamentally that is correct but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists . Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen Scarcity because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC . Did you know that there ’ s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can sparking an “ altcoin season ” in the undervalued precious metals . Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly . As of today there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams and there ’ s even less than that available to buy due to industrial use and hoarding . Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person . We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram . If we can take anything away from this analysis I hope it ’ s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie . This number doesn ’ t come from thin air . It ’ s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined . The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion . 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person . To put this into perspective the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home . About 810 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually . But only 1.82.7 billion of that goes towards bullion . 4045 % of Platinum gets used in industrial production . 3035 % goes towards jewelry . 2030 % goes towards bullion . If 40 % of all Platinum goes towards industrial use out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million . That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment . But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion . Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names I won ’ t be factoring them into this analysis . Doing the same math as before 193 million divided by 8.3 billion the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person . Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in . According to the World Platinum Investment Council 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion . If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out . That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC . You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum . Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved . But it ’ s not_just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum . South Africa is responsible for 7080 % of the world ’ s Platinum Russia is 16 % of the supply and Zimbabwe is 8 % . This is between 93100 % of the world ’ s total Platinum . There are other places that produce minor amounts like Canada . But there ’ s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common they are all facing major crisis . As far as what we are being told Platinum production in Russia has not_slowed down due to the war . If you aren ’ t in the know South Africa and Zimbabwe are not_doing so hot . From a volatile political climate food and water shortages and major power outages . Pick your poison . South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa . Zimbabwe is still in a bad way . Ultimately both countries have a long way to go . How do these crisis affect the Platinum price With electricity being in short supply it ’ s in high demand . High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum . Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance . This is the result Platinum mines being shut down delayed and abandoned . All because the price of Platinum is too low . With recent rises in Platinum prices the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned . But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them . I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses . As the supply problem persisted for many years inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply . 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit and 2025 saw a 700000 ounce deficit . That and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100 % rise in Platinum this year . But it ’ s not_the only precious metal doing good . Gold is up 65 % this year after a 40 % rise in 2024 and silver is up 120 % this year after a phenomenal 2024 . There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors . They have begun to notice that the ratios don ’ t quite make sense . We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum . Not_only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option but so is the jewelry market . If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor ’ s price range . The reason for this is simple . The more rare something is the quicker the total supply can be bought out which leads to both faster and higher price hikes . This is most certainly a star aligning moment here . If enough retail investors join in this new trend the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person . However it ’ s important to consider that in 20222023 China India and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum . I think it ’ s because of them that the Platinum market won ’ t collapse in 2026 after years of deficit 2026 is projected to potentially break even . It certainly can ’ t be because of mining it ’ s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100 % . This is ultimately good for the retail investors though as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply . With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells AI semiconductors cancer treatments and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries Future industrial investment is not_only guaranteed but it ’ s guaranteed to grow . But what happens when industry can no_longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition It gets priced out of retail . What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal . It wasn ’ t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties and we still don ’ t fully understand these unique properties . This is why Platinum is changing the world and it ’ s also why you can still afford it . Your kids might not_be able to . There ’ s simply not_enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand and it ’ s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important . TLDR Less than half a gram per person currently a 700000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023 an increase in bullion and jewelry demand and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable . You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals it ’ s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too ."

      "selftext": "I recently interacted with a financial advisor who is a strong advocate of dividend stock investing for a long-term buy & hold with automatic reinvestment. His thesis was that he could put together a portfolio of 30 stocks that would consistent yield an average of 6% in dividends alone so that his total return was never reliant upon any price appreciation assumptions. He presented some compelling back testing (nobody ever presents lackluster back testing) but generally, the thesis is an interesting one and not something I frequently encounter when working with advisors. I am in wealthtech so I interact with a wide variety of advisors, almost all of whom have their purported secret sauce. I didn't try to see into his black box for screening his 30 stocks, but I posed the question to GPT 5.1 Thinking to see what it yielded. It's a long response, so I've copied it into the pastebin link below. Obviously this would be most attractive in a tax-deferred registration, though I told it to ensure that dividends were qualified so they receive LTCG treatment vs. ordinary income which would make it more tolerable in a taxable account. There is a lot of color in the GPT response, but the example portfolio it provided is included. Other than concentration risk, what could be the potential stumbling blocks of a strategy like this? Cap gains from liquidating and replacing a position that has started failing the screen? (Not relevant in tax-deferred or Roth accounts) I'm not advocating for or against this, just curious.",

      "selftext_processed": "I recently interacted with a financial advisor who is a strong advocate of dividend stock investing for a longterm buy hold with automatic reinvestment . His thesis was that he could put together a portfolio of 30 stocks that would consistent yield an average of 6 % in dividends alone so that his total return was never_reliant upon any price appreciation assumptions . He presented some compelling back testing nobody ever presents lackluster back testing but generally the thesis is an interesting one and not_something I frequently encounter when working with advisors . I am in wealthtech so I interact with a wide variety of advisors almost all of whom have their purported secret sauce . I didnt try to see into his black box for screening his 30 stocks but I posed the question to GPT 5.1 Thinking to see what it yielded . Its a long response so Ive copied it into the pastebin link below . Obviously this would be most attractive in a taxdeferred registration though I told it to ensure that dividends were qualified so they receive LTCG treatment vs. ordinary income which would make it more tolerable in a taxable account . There is a lot of color in the GPT response but the example portfolio it provided is included . Other than concentration risk what could be the potential stumbling blocks of a strategy like this Cap gains from liquidating and replacing a position that has started failing the screen Not relevant in taxdeferred or Roth accounts Im not_advocating for or against this just curious ."

      "selftext": "Most microcap pharma press releases read the same: approval today, revenue maybe years later. This one is different. Sunshine Biopharma’s Canadian arm, Nora Pharma, just received Health Canada approval for Domperidone, a widely prescribed gastrointestinal drug. This is not a trial-stage asset or a future filing. It is an approved prescription product entering a regulated market where Sunshine already operates. The company already has more than 60 generic drugs approved in Canada, which means the sales, distribution, and compliance infrastructure is in place. That context matters. Regulatory wins only have value when a company can monetize them. Domperidone adds another revenue-producing SKU to an existing portfolio, not a standalone bet. On top of that, Sunshine has recently launched generic doxycycline 100 mg tablets nationwide in Canada, followed by Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug with steady long-term demand. Financially, the market is still treating these approvals like abstract progress. Sunshine reported roughly +18% year-over-year revenue growth while the entire company is valued around a $6M market cap. That disconnect is where opportunity is. Do your own research too",

Financially the market is still treating these approvals like abstract progress . Sunshine reported roughly 18 % yearoveryear revenue growth while the entire company is valued around a $ 6M market cap . That disconnect is where opportunity is . Do your own research too"

      "selftext": "Iretired earlier this year and am beginning the \"transition\". I am looking at ways to: 1) Lower my exposure to tax-deferred assets. 2) Use my tax-free assets to generate monthly income. 3)Allow my tax-deferred assets to continue to grow in quality stock/bond funds. With respect to 1) above, I have started doing Roth conversions and plan to continue to age 75. If I do nothing, my estimate is that RMDs will push me into the 24% tax bracket at age 75. I also want to avoid leaving my heirs with a hefty tax bill to pay on their inheritance. The focus of this post is #2 above. I am looking at ways to start an tax-free income stream from our Roth IRAs. Advosors recommend that I consider an annuity, something that will tie up the funds ... and I do not want to do. I am considering investing this money (about $500K into an ETF that pays monthly dividends ... something like PBDC, SPYI, QQQI, or VGI. I calculate that some of these funds will pay about $2,500 per month in distributions if I invest the nearly $500K. Is there any other way (other than an annuity) to generate this level of income? Your thoughts? Thank you ...",

      "title": "BofA: Fed’s RMPs, combined with Treasury issuance strategy, may create QE-like market effects",
      "selftext": "Bank of America Securities published its US Rates Watch report on December 12, with a key takeaway that has drawn a lot of attention: the Federal Reserve’s newly launched Reserve Management Purchases (RMPs), while not QE in name, could generate QE-like market effects when combined with Treasury issuance strategy potentially compressing the 10-year Treasury yield by 20–30 basis points. Mechanically, the Fed is expected to purchase approximately $378 billion of Treasury bills via RMPs in calendar year 2026, alongside $181 billion of MBS reinvestments, absorbing roughly $560 billion in bills in total. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury is projected to increase short-term bill issuance by about $500 billion in 2026, while reducing longer dated coupon issuance by roughly $600 billion. As BofA strategist Meghan Swiber puts it, “This parallel offset between the Fed balance sheet and UST issuance has a flavor of financial repression.” Scenario analysis suggests that if the Treasury continues to delay coupon issuance, the cumulative reduction in 10-year duration-equivalent supply over FY26–FY27 could reach $700 billion to $1 trillion, effectively injecting 20–30 bps of net easing into the market. Based on this framework, BofA favors long positions in 2-year swap spreads and 5-year real yields, while remaining bearish on near-term rate volatility. Taken together, the implication is that financial conditions may already be easing even without an explicit shift in the policy rate itself.",

      "selftext_processed": "Bank of America Securities published its US Rates Watch report on December 12 with a key takeaway that has drawn a lot of attention the Federal Reserve ’ s newly launched Reserve Management Purchases RMPs while not_QE in name could generate QElike market effects when combined with Treasury issuance strategy potentially compressing the 10year Treasury yield by 20–30 basis points . Mechanically the Fed is expected to purchase approximately $ 378 billion of Treasury bills via RMPs in calendar year 2026 alongside $ 181 billion of MBS reinvestments absorbing roughly $ 560 billion in bills in total . At the same time the U.S. Treasury is projected to increase shortterm bill issuance by about $ 500 billion in 2026 while reducing longer dated coupon issuance by roughly $ 600 billion . As BofA strategist Meghan Swiber puts it “ This parallel offset between the Fed balance sheet and UST issuance has a flavor of financial repression. ” Scenario analysis suggests that if the Treasury continues to delay coupon issuance the cumulative reduction in 10year durationequivalent supply over FY26–FY27 could reach $ 700 billion to $ 1 trillion effectively injecting 20–30 bps of net easing into the market . Based on this framework BofA favors long positions in 2year swap spreads and 5year real yields while remaining bearish on nearterm rate volatility . Taken together the implication is that financial conditions may already be easing even without an explicit shift in the policy rate itself ."

      "selftext": "The economy will likely perform well at the asset-price level in 2026 after some volatility at the beginning of the year, even as the real economy continues to lag, inflation remains sticky and small business continues to struggle with higher borrowing costs. I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI data-center CapEx binge. Oracle, in particular, is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers. This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue. If they keep spending without near-term revenue to match, the market will continue to reprice the stock downward, emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load. They won’t be allowed to fail however. Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts, a de facto bailout is the base case. Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit. The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them, while the real economy continues to absorb the losses, with this wealth effect supporting prices. Markets are likely to re-inflate mid-year, as Q2 earnings, CapEx spending milestones, and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported. Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle, and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well. We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer, but only by masking the slowdown beneath. That’s how I anticipate the next year playing out.",

      "selftext_processed": "The economy will likely perform well at the assetprice level in 2026 after some volatility at the beginning of the year even as the real economy continues to lag inflation remains sticky and small business continues to struggle with higher borrowing costs . I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI datacenter CapEx binge . Oracle in particular is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers . This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue . If they keep spending without nearterm revenue to match the market will continue to reprice the stock downward emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load . They won ’ t be allowed to fail however . Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts a de facto bailout is the base case . Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit . The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them while the real economy continues to absorb the losses with this wealth effect supporting prices . Markets are likely to reinflate midyear as Q2 earnings CapEx spending milestones and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported . Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well . We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer but only by masking the slowdown beneath . That ’ s how I anticipate the next year playing out ."

      "title": "Why I’m out of Chinese fintechs (QFIN & FINV), even though they look “cheap”",
      "selftext": "I closed my positions in QFIN and FINV last week. This isn’t a rage quit and it’s not because I think the companies are trash. I still think both are real businesses. But I don’t like the setup anymore, and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience. When I bought them the thesis was straightforward: • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper, that’s usually a good combo. What changed? Three things broke the setup. 1) Regulation is back in the driver’s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025. The legal interest cap didn’t change, but the economics did. Loan pricing is coming down in practice. Banks are taking more control of underwriting and post-loan management. Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work. That’s a margin squeeze, full stop. When your business model depends on spread and fees, this matters more than valuation. 2) Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3. Not a crisis, but enough to force tighter underwriting. That creates a bad loop: • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3) Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me. QFIN guided to a sharp year-over-year earnings drop in Q4. FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits. That tells you management is playing defense, not offense. Defensive mode + regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion. But aren’t they cheap? Yes. Very, under 4x earnings. And that’s the trap. Chinese fintech sentiment is awful. Investors don’t trust the regulatory backdrop, don’t trust the macro, and don’t trust that rules won’t change again. You can argue that’s irrational. You can also watch stocks go nowhere for two years while being “right.” These aren’t broken companies. They’re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box. I’d rather step aside, redeploy capital, and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer. You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no where.",

I still think both are real businesses . But I don ’ t like the setup anymore and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience . When I bought them the thesis was straightforward • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper that ’ s usually a good combo . What changed Three things broke the setup . 1 Regulation is back in the driver ’ s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025 . The legal interest cap didn ’ t change but the economics did . Loan pricing is coming down in practice . Banks are taking more control of underwriting and postloan management . Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work . That ’ s a margin squeeze full stop . When your business model depends on spread and fees this matters more than valuation . 2 Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3 . Not_a crisis but enough to force tighter underwriting . That creates a bad loop • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3 Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me . QFIN guided to a sharp yearoveryear earnings drop in Q4 . FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits . That tells you management is playing defense not_offense . Defensive mode regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion . But aren ’ t they cheap Yes . Very under 4x earnings . And that ’ s the trap . Chinese fintech sentiment is awful . Investors don ’ t trust the regulatory backdrop don ’ t trust the macro and don ’ t trust that rules won ’ t change again . You can argue that ’ s irrational . You can also watch stocks go nowhere_for two years while being “ right. ” These aren ’ t broken companies . They ’ re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box . I ’ d rather step aside redeploy capital and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer . You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no_where ."

      "selftext": "Investing.com -- Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:ZG) stock fell over 5.5% Monday as investors reacted to news that Google is testing a new real estate advertising format that could potentially compete with Zillow's services. The search giant has introduced a mobile-centric real estate ad format that provides comprehensive property details, options to request home tours, and displays similar listings directly within search results. This new format allows users to schedule home showings with \"top-rated\" local agents through a \"Request a tour\" button, with an expected response time of 15 minutes. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng noted that while the immediate impact on Zillow may be limited, the development represents a potential long-term risk. \"While we don't expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow's business, given that most of Zillow's traffic is direct and Google's new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers, we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,\" wrote Ng, who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock. Google's new ad product is a collaboration with real estate analytics and brokerage firm ComeHome, which sources listings reportedly from the Multiple Listing Service rather than directly from listing agents. The format directly competes with Zillow's Premier Agent program by facilitating lead generation for buy-side agents from prospective homebuyers. The new Google feature embeds capabilities typically found on real estate portals, including filters for bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price, and new listing status, potentially challenging Zillow's position as a go-to destination for home searches. Key Points Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results. The listings allowed users to view the full details of a property’s page, request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com’s online marketplace portal. “While we don’t expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow’s business ... we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,” Goldman Sachs’ Michael Ng said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Investing.com Zillow Group Inc NASDAQZG stock fell over 5.5 % Monday as investors reacted to news that Google is testing a new real estate advertising format that could potentially compete with Zillows services . The search giant has introduced a mobilecentric real estate ad format that provides comprehensive property details options to request home tours and displays similar listings directly within search results . This new format allows users to schedule home showings with toprated local agents through a Request a tour button with an expected response time of 15 minutes . Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng noted that while the immediate impact on Zillow may be limited the development represents a potential longterm risk . While we dont expect a direct nearterm impact on Zillows business given that most of Zillows traffic is direct and Googles new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers we view this development as a longterm risk for real estate portals like Zillow wrote Ng who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock . Googles new ad product is a collaboration with real estate analytics and brokerage firm ComeHome which sources listings reportedly from the Multiple Listing Service rather than directly from listing agents . The format directly competes with Zillows Premier Agent program by facilitating lead generation for buyside agents from prospective homebuyers . The new Google feature embeds capabilities typically found on real estate portals including filters for bedrooms bathrooms square footage price and new listing status potentially challenging Zillows position as a goto destination for home searches . Key Points Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results . The listings allowed users to view the full details of a property ’ s page request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com ’ s online marketplace portal . “ While we don ’ t expect a direct nearterm impact on Zillow ’ s business ... we view this development as a longterm risk for real estate portals like Zillow ” Goldman Sachs ’ Michael Ng said ."

      "selftext": "With many companies seemingly IPO’ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit, does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins? How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced? In cases like HOOD or Figma, many felt the valuation was too stretched, meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that’s what happened somewhat with HOOD. Do most of you focus on peer multiples, revenue growth, margins, and long-term TAM when deciding to participate? Given that, do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects -like Medline -offers a better risk-reward at entry? What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry? Taking examples of upcoming IPO’s like SpaceX - slightly overvalued, Stripe, data-bricks, Anduril (don’t know about them) but medline looks kinda good but don’t know if it would be multi-bagger. So, throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn’t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO’s. Let’s win together. Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together. TIA.",

      "selftext_processed": "With many companies seemingly IPO ’ ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced In cases like HOOD or Figma many felt the valuation was too stretched meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that ’ s what happened somewhat with HOOD . Do most of you focus on peer multiples revenue growth margins and longterm TAM when deciding to participate Given that do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects like Medline offers a better riskreward at entry What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry Taking examples of upcoming IPO ’ s like SpaceX slightly overvalued Stripe databricks Anduril don ’ t know about them but medline looks kinda good but don ’ t know if it would be multibagger . So throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn ’ t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO ’ s . Let ’ s win together . Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together .

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a massive uptick in ads and articles lately pitching Private Equity and Private Credit to everyday retail investors. The narrative is always the same: the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultra-wealthy have enjoyed for years. But I’ve been digging into the market data and I’m convinced this is fishy as fuck. It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players. Institutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently \"over-allocated\" to private markets. Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didn't mark down as fast, their portfolios are out of balance. They are effectively tapped out. They can't put more money in, and more importantly, they are screaming for cash distributions. They want their money back, but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and M&A is slow. This is where the retail investor comes in. Since the \"smart money\" is tapped out, Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running. They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell. You can see this clearly in the AI sector. We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality, often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no profit. Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains, but they having the problem, that if they would try to IPO these companies right now, the public markets might reject those valuations, forcing a \"down round\" that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money. The solution is to avoid the public market entirely. Instead, they move these assets into \"continuation funds\" or sell them on the secondary market. And who is financing this? It’s retail capital. They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in. The most dangerous part is how they structure it. They sell these as \"semi-liquid\" funds, but the liquidity is an illusion. These funds have \"gates,\" meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once, like in a recession, they simply lock the door. We saw this with Blackstone’s real estate fund recently. So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch. Just know that when you hear about the \"democratization of finance\" be very careful. “Democratization” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to, true to the motto: privatize earnings, socialize losses.",

You can see this clearly in the AI sector . We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no_profit . Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains but they having the problem that if they would try to IPO these companies right now the public markets might reject those valuations forcing a down round that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money . The solution is to avoid the public market entirely . Instead they move these assets into continuation funds or sell them on the secondary market . And who is financing this It ’ s retail capital . They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in . The most dangerous part is how they structure it . They sell these as semiliquid funds but the liquidity is an illusion . These funds have gates meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once like in a recession they simply lock the door . We saw this with Blackstone ’ s real estate fund recently . So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch . Just know that when you hear about the democratization of finance be very careful . “ Democratization ” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to true to the motto privatize earnings socialize losses ."

      "title": "[Backtest] Outperforming the S&P 500 with a \"Risk-On/Risk-Off\" Regime Filter (2005-2025). 14.8% CAGR vs 10.6% SPY",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a macro \"regime filter\" designed to detect high-probability crash environments with minimal lag. The goal wasn’t to build a high-frequency trading bot, but a robust asset allocation strategy that protects capital during deep corrections while participating in bull markets. I recently finished a realistic 20-year backtest (2005–Present) covering the GFC, 2018 Volmageddon, Covid-19, and the 2022 inflation bear market. **The Strategy Concept** The logic is simple: * **Risk-On:** When the market structure is healthy, go **100% SPY** (S&P 500). * **Risk-Off:** When the signal flags a \"Bear Regime,\" switch **100% to GLD** (Gold). **The \"Secret Sauce\" (Without giving it away)** Most indicators are lagging (like a simple 200 SMA). My signal combines trend following with **tail-risk pricing metrics** (measuring the market's perception of outlier events) to identify structural weakness before the floor falls out. **The Setup (Realistic Constraints)** I hate backtests that ignore costs or assume instant execution. To make this realistic: * **Rebalancing:** Weekly (Checked Friday close, Executed Monday open). * **Transaction Costs:** Included (7 bps per trade). * **Slippage/Lag:** Accounted for by executing the next trading day after the signal. **The Results (2005 - 2025)** Initial Capital: $10,000 |**Metric**|**Buy & Hold (SPY)**|**Risk-On/Off Strategy**|**Difference**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Final Value**|$83,297|**$181,817**|\\+$98,520| |**CAGR**|10.67%|**14.88%**|\\+4.21%| |**Max Drawdown**|\\-55.2%|**-32.9%**|Reduced Risk| |**Sharpe Ratio**|0.56|**0.88**|\\+0.32| |**Trades/Year**|0|**\\~7.7**|Low Frequency| |**Worst Year**|\\-36.8%|**-8.5%**|Crisis Alpha| **Why Weekly Rebalancing?** I tested Daily, Weekly, and Monthly frequencies. * **Daily:** Too much noise. Whipsaws destroyed returns via transaction costs. * **Monthly:** Too slow. By the time you switch to Gold, the crash has already happened (e.g., Covid 2020). * **Weekly:** The sweet spot. It filters out noise but reacts fast enough to catch major regime shifts. **Key Takeaway** The outperformance didn't come from leverage or picking penny stocks. It came from **avoiding the math of big losses.** * In 2008, SPY drew down over 50%. This strategy pivoted to Gold, preserving capital. * By capping the downside, the compounding base remained high for the recovery.",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** **My take: MSTR doesn’t survive more than \\~3 years in most realistic scenarios.** BTC down → MSTR dies fast. BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends + interest. BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working. Different paths, same ending. Longer version for anyone who still has attention span: I’ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don’t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane, volatile bull runs forever *and* the market keeps clapping while getting diluted. At this point MSTR isn’t a software company. It’s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on. The stock trades like BTC on steroids. That’s great when BTC is ripping. It’s terrible when time passes. Here’s the part people gloss over: MSTR has real cash bills. Preferred dividends. Interest. Normal company expenses. Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash. The software business doesn’t cover it. So the whole strategy boils down to two options: * keep issuing stock * or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns. That premium is the entire engine. Once it shrinks, dilution stops being “genius capital markets strategy” and starts being “why am I getting wrecked every quarter.” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value. That’s the model coughing. Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk. I think boring Bitcoin is worse. If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two, volatility dries up, hype fades, and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash. Cash reserves buy time, not survival. And here’s the ironic part: if Bitcoin actually *wins* and becomes mainstream, I still don’t think MSTR wins. In that world, people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly. No dilution. No debt. No CEO risk. MSTR goes from “unique BTC proxy” to “why would I own this instead of IBIT?” So take your pick: * BTC crashes → MSTR blows up * BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out * BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering face-ripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely. That’s not a business model, that’s a belief system. Not saying it won’t pump again. It probably will. This thing feeds on volatility and vibes. But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown. That’s my take. Flame away. **Some actual math:** * **Bitcoin held:** \\~**650,000 BTC** (varies slightly with recent buys; order of magnitude matters) * **BTC value (at $90k):** 650,000 × 90,000 ≈ **$58.5B** * **Cash on hand / reserve:** \\~**$1.3–1.5B** (company explicitly set this aside for dividends + debt service) * **Annual preferred dividends:** ≈ **$85–90M per year** (cash, not optional long term) * **Annual interest expense:** Roughly **$200–250M per year** across converts + senior notes * **Total fixed cash burn:** ≈ **$300–340M per year** (before software ops, which are roughly breakeven at best) * **Runway math (flat BTC, no new dilution):** $1.4B ÷ $320M ≈ **4.3 years** * **More realistic runway (assuming some continued buying / volatility):** **\\~2.5–3.5 years** * **Important detail:** * Interest on debt → **cannot be skipped** without default * Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily, but **they accumulate** and make refinancing harder * Software business → does **not** cover these obligations * **Key structural issue:** The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV, issuing stock becomes value-destructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock. * **What forces BTC selling:** Flat BTC + compressed premium + fixed cash burn = **selling BTC becomes rational**, not ideological. Position: Small position, adding slowly. No options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ. Yes, decay sucks — but it’s still the cleanest way for me to play this. ￼​(DD assisted by AI)",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR My take MSTR doesn ’ t survive more than 3 years in most realistic scenarios . BTC down → MSTR dies fast . BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends interest . BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working . Different paths same ending . Longer version for anyone who still has attention span I ’ ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don ’ t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane volatile bull runs forever and the market keeps clapping while getting diluted . At this point MSTR isn ’ t a software company . It ’ s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on . The stock trades like BTC on steroids . That ’ s great when BTC is ripping . It ’ s terrible when time passes . Here ’ s the part people gloss over MSTR has real cash bills . Preferred dividends . Interest . Normal company expenses . Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash . The software business doesn ’ t cover it . So the whole strategy boils down to two options keep issuing stock or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns . That premium is the entire engine . Once it shrinks dilution stops being “ genius capital markets strategy ” and starts being “ why am I getting wrecked every quarter. ” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value . That ’ s the model coughing . Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk . I think boring Bitcoin is worse . If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two volatility dries up hype fades and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash . Cash reserves buy time not_survival . And here ’ s the ironic part if Bitcoin actually wins and becomes mainstream I still don ’ t think MSTR wins . In that world people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly . No_dilution . No_debt . No_CEO risk . MSTR goes from “ unique BTC proxy ” to “ why would I own this instead of IBIT ” So take your pick BTC crashes → MSTR blows up BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering faceripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely . That ’ s not_a business model that ’ s a belief system . Not_saying it won ’ t pump again . It probably will . This thing feeds on volatility and vibes . But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown . That ’ s my take . Flame away . Some actual math Bitcoin held 650000 BTC varies slightly with recent buys order of magnitude matters BTC value at $ 90k 650000 × 90000 ≈ $ 58.5B Cash on hand reserve $ 1.3–1.5B company explicitly set this aside for dividends debt service Annual preferred dividends ≈ $ 85–90M per year cash not_optional long term Annual interest expense Roughly $ 200–250M per year across converts senior notes Total fixed cash burn ≈ $ 300–340M per year before software ops which are roughly breakeven at best Runway math flat BTC no_new dilution $ 1.4B ÷ $ 320M ≈ 4.3 years More realistic runway assuming some continued buying volatility 2.5–3.5 years Important detail Interest on debt → can not be skipped without default Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily but they accumulate and make refinancing harder Software business → does not cover these obligations Key structural issue The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV issuing stock becomes valuedestructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock . What forces BTC selling Flat BTC compressed premium fixed cash burn selling BTC becomes rational not_ideological . Position Small position adding slowly . No_options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ . Yes decay sucks — but it ’ s still the cleanest way for me to play this . ￼​DD assisted by AI"

But the reality is: \\- fast casual continues to gain market share, winner over casual dining ($15 salad made to your liking still beats a $15 salad at a sit down where it’s probably all Sysco with a 20% tip) \\- Sweetgreen just hired an old exec from Chipotle as their DAO to help with margins \\- $230m cash on hand, enough to get through 2+ years at current burn rates, ignoring the fact they’re slowing down new restaurant openings to help with capital spend, and their 10% layoffs this year and sale of Spyce which took 38 engineers off their payroll \\- valuation is way off compared to peers, about 1x sales vs 4x for Cava and Chipotle \\- they now have a 1.2% stake in Wonder, which owns Grubhub and the ghost kitchen space and is going to scale their Infinite Kitchen technology, where sweetgreen retains the license and right to purchase at cost + 5% \\- ask any AI to rank the top 20 fast casual restaurants and which one has the most premium branding, SG is always on top By the way: \\- 25% short interest \\- 95% held by institutions and insiders \\- it’s called “sweetgreen” \\- there’s an invite-only membership called “goat status” where you get various perks and when you pick up you get a black bag instead of a green one \\- every Becky I know loves sweetgreen. If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you’d be rich now \\- if you can’t afford an $15 salad then this isn’t for you. Go buy your $12 value meal \\- no one has ever complained about “sweetgreen shits” like they do with chipotle. Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality.

If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you ’ d be rich now if you can ’ t afford an $ 15 salad then this isn ’ t for you . Go buy your $ 12 value meal no_one has ever complained about “ sweetgreen shits ” like they do with chipotle . Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality .

      "selftext": "Hear me out because I think many people do not consider this. 1. Many people will withdraw their investments when they *have to*, not when the market is particularly suitable for withdrawal. 2. This means that the market's average annual returns over the past 50 years don't mean that much if it just so happens that you have to withdraw during a market downturn. 3. This means the \"average return\" you are likely interested in is not \"average return till now\" - it's the average of \"return till X period, return till 2X period, return till 3X period, ... return till now\". This is a relatively different number from the \"average return till now\" number - depending on how you pick the \"X period\". This \"X period\" dictates your actual risk appetite IMO. For someone who feels they might have to withdraw on a day's notice (X = 1 day), the actual average return is a lot lower. Even with 1 month's notice it comes to around 7% per my calculations, not the standard 12% annual returns people assume. Now I understand there is also a large number of people investing for whom this is not strictly relevant because they have a decent emergency corpus. But nowadays many people are investing without that cover in place. The closest industry term I can find is \"AHPR\" (average holding period return) but it's not quite the same it seems? And also not that widely discussed. IMO it's unfair to the normal middle class investors that this is not clearly communicated to them. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I’m looking to start building a Section 8 portfolio and wanted to get some feedback from those of you who’ve already gone down this path. Full disclosure: I’m not here for the “don’t do it” horror stories, I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants, just like any other type of tenant, and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening. A little about my situation: I’m based in Florida, but I’m considering investing out of state. Florida’s a tough market for single-family homes, especially with high insurance costs and the ever-present risk of hurricanes. I’m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere, but I need some advice on where exactly to focus. A few specific questions: * Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio? * How did you determine the market you’re investing in is solid for Section 8? * I’ve heard mixed things about Detroit, the houses are dirt cheap, but what’s the catch? Is it really a bad spot for Section 8? * Is a 5% ROI (after property management, mortgage, etc.) considered too low? I know ROI can vary, but what do you typically look for as a “sweet spot” for a sustainable portfolio? * Do you focus on 2-bed, 3-bed, or 4-bed units? Why? I’d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it. Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow, suggestions would be helpful, especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

Full disclosure I ’ m not_here for the “ don ’ t do it ” horror stories I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants just like any other type of tenant and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening . A little about my situation I ’ m based in Florida but I ’ m considering investing out of state . Florida ’ s a tough market for singlefamily homes especially with high insurance costs and the everpresent risk of hurricanes . I ’ m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere but I need some advice on where exactly to focus . A few specific questions Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio How did you determine the market you ’ re investing in is solid for Section 8 I ’ ve heard mixed things about Detroit the houses are dirt cheap but what ’ s the catch Is it really a bad spot for Section 8 Is a 5 % ROI after property management mortgage etc . considered too low I know ROI can vary but what do you typically look for as a “ sweet spot ” for a sustainable portfolio Do you focus on 2bed 3bed or 4bed units Why I ’ d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it . Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow suggestions would be helpful especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance"

The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here: Sustained, above-consensus subscriber growth (volume engine): T-Mobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 (millions of net adds across postpaid phone, other and prepaid from acquisitions), with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press. Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue, ARPU stability/upside, and superior churn economics vs. peers. This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows. ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains: T-Mobile built a broad mid-band 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger; that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage + performance, especially for price-sensitive consumers and suburban/rural areas. Faster, cheaper 5G motivates upgrades (premium plans, 5G broadband) and supports new services (fixed 5G broadband, enterprise customers). Company commentary and analysts emphasize its network-driven wins. Diversifying revenue: broadband & fiber tuck-ins T-Mobile is not just phones — they’ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers (e.g., Metronet acquisitions) to scale fixed connectivity offerings. Owning both wireless and fiber/fixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value. ￼ Material free-cash-flow (FCF) tailwinds + aggressive capital returns: Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF; the company just authorized a large $14.6B shareholder return program (through 2026) and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors, supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion. Buybacks + dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return. ￼ Room for margin expansion (profit curve + operating leverage): As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex (once major 5G build is complete) and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers, EBITDA margins can improve. Market commentary and management’s guidance point to steady service revenue growth (high-margin) and improving profitability. ￼ Valuation gap + analyst upside: Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings / price targets in the $275–$280 range, suggesting \\~35–45% upside from current levels, supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns. If the market re-rates T-Mobile nearer to those comps, upside is substantial. ￼ Numbers that matter (evidence-backed): Record net adds / scale: company reported multi-million postpaid adds in Q3 2025 (e.g., 3,287,000 postpaid phone & other adds referenced in the release / press). These are eye-popping numbers that materially grow revenue base. ￼ Service revenue growth: management reported double-digit growth in postpaid service revenue and mid/high single-digit on overall service revenue in recent quarters. That’s a high-quality revenue stream. ￼ Shareholder returns: $14.6B authorized program through 2026 + dividend increase to $1.02 per quarter (recently declared), both compress available shares and increase yield/total return. ￼ Valuation framework & target: Base case (multiple expansion + FCF growth): If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count \\~3–5% annually, the market could re-apply a telecom / growth multiple lift (say from mid-teens to low-20s on EV/EBITDA) as growth proves durable. That supports a move into the $250–$300 range over 12–24 months. (Analyst targets cluster near $275–$280.) ￼ Conservative case: Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → low-double-digit total return from current price (dividend + modest multiple expansion) — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow. Bull case: Continued share gains, ARPU stability, strong fiber/wireless bundling, and aggressive buybacks drive EPS substantially higher — stock re-rates to premium growth multiple → $300+ possible over 18–36 months.",

The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here Sustained aboveconsensus subscriber growth volume engine TMobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 millions of net adds across postpaid phone other and prepaid from acquisitions with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press . Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue ARPU stabilityupside and superior churn economics vs. peers . This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows . ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains TMobile built a broad midband 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage performance especially for pricesensitive consumers and suburbanrural areas . Faster cheaper 5G motivates upgrades premium plans 5G broadband and supports new services fixed 5G broadband enterprise customers . Company commentary and analysts emphasize its networkdriven wins . Diversifying revenue broadband fiber tuckins TMobile is not_just phones — they ’ ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers e.g . Metronet acquisitions to scale fixed connectivity offerings . Owning both wireless and fiberfixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value . ￼ Material freecashflow FCF tailwinds aggressive capital returns Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF the company just authorized a large $ 14.6B shareholder return program through 2026 and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion . Buybacks dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return . ￼ Room for margin expansion profit curve operating leverage As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex once major 5G build is complete and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers EBITDA margins can improve . Market commentary and management ’ s guidance point to steady service revenue growth highmargin and improving profitability . ￼ Valuation gap analyst upside Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings price targets in the $ 275– $ 280 range suggesting 35–45 % upside from current levels supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns . If the market rerates TMobile nearer to those comps upside is substantial . ￼ Numbers that matter evidencebacked Record net adds scale company reported multimillion postpaid adds in Q3 2025 e.g . 3287000 postpaid phone other adds referenced in the release press . These are eyepopping numbers that materially grow revenue base . ￼ Service revenue growth management reported doubledigit growth in postpaid service revenue and midhigh singledigit on overall service revenue in recent quarters . That ’ s a highquality revenue stream . ￼ Shareholder returns $ 14.6B authorized program through 2026 dividend increase to $ 1.02 per quarter recently declared both compress available shares and increase yieldtotal return . ￼ Valuation framework target Base case multiple expansion FCF growth If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count 3–5 % annually the market could reapply a telecom growth multiple lift say from midteens to low20s on EVEBITDA as growth proves durable . That supports a move into the $ 250– $ 300 range over 12–24 months . Analyst targets cluster near $ 275– $ 280 . ￼ Conservative case Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → lowdoubledigit total return from current price dividend modest multiple expansion — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow . Bull case Continued share gains ARPU stability strong fiberwireless bundling and aggressive buybacks drive EPS substantially higher — stock rerates to premium growth multiple → $ 300 possible over 18–36 months ."

      "title": "KRMN: The Pick-and-Shovel Space Play",
      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase, if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit, then KRMN is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= What fueled **KRMN's 189% run** since its IPO on February 13? # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum, and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit (*get it?*) # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that **positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond**. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and **national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( []( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day. ================================= Shares, cost basis $58.99 And a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** (these are cheap risk, high reward, though!) because they were dirt cheap, and I know KRMN can move $7-10 in two or three days. However, the play is long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit then KRMN is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . What fueled KRMNs 189 % run since its IPO on February 13 The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit get it 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day . Shares cost basis $ 58.99 And a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls these are cheap risk high reward though because they were dirt cheap and I know KRMN can move $ 710 in two or three days . However the play is longterm ."
