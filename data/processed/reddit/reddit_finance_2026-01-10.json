      "selftext": "After the operation in Venezuela, US could start targeting : 1 - Iran - All the protests & riots inside the Iran has spreaded quickly. Trump warned Iran thst US could bomb them too hard if they continue killing Iranians. 2 - Greenland - After becoming president, Trump stated multiple times that US should have greenland as their part as Russian & Chinese are increasing their influence in the artic region. Denmark opposed this idea. This could break US-Nato / US-Europe long standing relations. Denmark warned that its troops are under standing orders to “shoot first and ask questions later” if Greenland comes under attack amid rising European unease over USA under President Trump openly weighing military action to seize the Arctic territory. 3 - Mexico - Recently on an interview, Trump stated that he could soon do land strikes upon drug cartels in Mexico. 4 - Cuba - Cuba's President Gustavo Petro said that he had good phone call with President Trump and soon be meeting with him in White House. But you could never know when Trump changes his mind to strike on Cuba also. 5 - Russia - Yes, its Russia. US recently seized many Russian oil tankers through their military usage. Concluding all, US will try to control every oil that they can through their military. MAGA is now old. Make American Military Great Again - MAMGA is the new MAGA. According to America - If you have Oil and don't have a NUCLEAR weapon. The oil belongs to America.",

      "title": "Crypto DATs are literally legal ponzi machine (BMNR / SBET / MSTR)",
      "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, I'm not against any digital asset treasuries (DATs), it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and it's legal. (Disclosure: I even have some position in some DATs) The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago, I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 2\\~3 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock, and I dismissed it as one of the \"stupid things in crypto\". But two weeks ago, I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20% discount on NAV, that piqued my interest, because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me, so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs, and if the opportunity is real or a trap. After some studying, and cut through all the bullshit terminology, I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is. # What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase, it'll probably be \"market irrationality harvester\", \"idiot harvesting machine\" or \"wealth transfer machine\" (transfer from idiot ofc). These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy, looks like a fund, but does not follow funds regulation or structure, a fund that has less transparency requirement, less protection for their shareholders (that's the point, it has to harvest the idiots). What the entire management do is very simple, they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean, ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock. The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type: * People who buy when the stock is below NAV (not necessarily mean they'll profit, more on this later.) * People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV (not necessarily mean they will lose money too! but **majority of them DO lose money**, they are the target to be harvested, or to be transfer wealth from.) Let's start with the simple one, why people who buy above the NAV will not necessarily lose money? Here's the ponzi part kicks in, because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV. To be fair though, many who bought above NAV knew this, just like in Ponzi, many know what they are getting into, but they just think they'll not be the last one holding the bag. (aka \"there'll be a greater fool\") Then there's people who buy the stock below NAV, these are usually people that'll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward, usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV, but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales, more on it next. # Accretive & Dilutive of DATs. Let me use a simple example, there's a stock with 1 million outstanding share, the entire value of the company is $1mil, so the NAV is exactly $1. In this example we'll assume the underlying asset value has no change and stay constant. Next, the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing, the stock price is now trading at $2 but the NAV stay unchanged, so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $2, raised $2mil and bought $2mil of underlying asset. Now there's 2 million outstanding shares, with $3mil underlying asset, the NAV of each share now becomes $1.5, this is **accretive**. Then some bad news happen, the stock price crashing from $2 to $1.5, then someone bought at $1.5, then it continue to crash to $1. At this point, the NAV is still $1.5, but the price of the stock is $1. For buyer at 3 difference price point * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.5 so they are fine for now. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, but they also know the NAV of the stock is $1.5 so they think they'll be fine. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, they figured out the NAV is $1.5 still below their entry price, they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock, to the same premium level for them to get out. Now for some reason, the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV, so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $1 price, raised another $1mil and bought the asset. Now there's 3 million outstanding share with $4mil underlying asset, the NAV becomes $1.33, falls from the previous $1.5 and this is **dilutive**. When this happen, all existing shareholders are equally harmed: * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.33, falling from previous $1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive, the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $1.33 they are still in lost, they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, the chance of them breakeven further decreases, as they require and even higher premium, and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point. So in conclusion, when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV, people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested. When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV, which happened before, and will likely happen again, all shareholders lose value in their share, the damage depends on what discount/premium level they got it. # Interest of the management is not aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part, unlike most of the Asset-based ETFs, there's a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premium/discount to keep the price close to the NAV, there's none for such DATs, and they are even worse than close end funds, because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market. The best part is, the management of these DATs doesn't necessarily care about the NAV per share, in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company, regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted. # So is there opportunity? Personally I think it's fine to make some risk calculated bet, especially when there's a deep discount on NAV, but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny, with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when it's dilutive. Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me, it amaze me because I never thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not create any production value at all, and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV, and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders, or the management itself. I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants, the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value, then stock like this should be banned, fined, or force to follow strict fund regulations. But anyway, I am not writing this because I care, I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the \"highly regulated\" stock market.",

      "selftext_processed": "Dont get me wrong Im not_against any digital asset treasuries DATs it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and its legal . Disclosure I even have some position in some DATs The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 23 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock and I dismissed it as one of the stupid things in crypto . But two weeks ago I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20 % discount on NAV that piqued my interest because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs and if the opportunity is real or a trap . After some studying and cut through all the bullshit terminology I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is . What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase itll probably be market irrationality harvester idiot harvesting machine or wealth transfer machine transfer from idiot ofc . These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy looks like a fund but does not_follow funds regulation or structure a fund that has less transparency requirement less protection for their shareholders thats the point it has to harvest the idiots . What the entire management do is very simple they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock . The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type People who buy when the stock is below NAV not necessarily mean theyll profit more on this later . People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV not necessarily mean they will lose money too but majority of them DO lose money they are the target to be harvested or to be transfer wealth from . Lets start with the simple one why people who buy above the NAV will not_necessarily lose money Heres the ponzi part kicks in because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV . To be fair though many who bought above NAV knew this just like in Ponzi many know what they are getting into but they just think theyll not_be the last one holding the bag . aka therell be a greater fool Then theres people who buy the stock below NAV these are usually people thatll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales more on it next . Accretive Dilutive of DATs . Let me use a simple example theres a stock with 1 million outstanding share the entire value of the company is $ 1mil so the NAV is exactly $ 1 . In this example well assume the underlying asset value has no_change and stay constant . Next the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing the stock price is now trading at $ 2 but the NAV stay unchanged so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $ 2 raised $ 2mil and bought $ 2mil of underlying asset . Now theres 2 million outstanding shares with $ 3mil underlying asset the NAV of each share now becomes $ 1.5 this is accretive . Then some bad news happen the stock price crashing from $ 2 to $ 1.5 then someone bought at $ 1.5 then it continue to crash to $ 1 . At this point the NAV is still $ 1.5 but the price of the stock is $ 1 . For buyer at 3 difference price point People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.5 so they are fine for now . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them but they also know the NAV of the stock is $ 1.5 so they think theyll be fine . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment they figured out the NAV is $ 1.5 still below their entry price they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock to the same premium level for them to get out . Now for some reason the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $ 1 price raised another $ 1mil and bought the asset . Now theres 3 million outstanding share with $ 4mil underlying asset the NAV becomes $ 1.33 falls from the previous $ 1.5 and this is dilutive . When this happen all existing shareholders are equally harmed People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.33 falling from previous $ 1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $ 1.33 they are still in lost they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment the chance of them breakeven further decreases as they require and even higher premium and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $ 1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point . So in conclusion when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested . When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV which happened before and will likely happen again all shareholders lose value in their share the damage depends on what discountpremium level they got it . Interest of the management is not_aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part unlike most of the Assetbased ETFs theres a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premiumdiscount to keep the price close to the NAV theres none for such DATs and they are even worse than close end funds because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market . The best part is the management of these DATs doesnt necessarily care about the NAV per share in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted . So is there opportunity Personally I think its fine to make some risk calculated bet especially when theres a deep discount on NAV but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when its dilutive . Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me it amaze me because I never_thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not_create any production value at all and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders or the management itself . I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value then stock like this should be banned fined or force to follow strict fund regulations . But anyway I am not_writing this because I care I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the highly regulated stock market ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week, and they printed. This morning I bought $CDE 1/23 $22 calls, and will be buying some longer-term calls next week. CDE made explosive moves today, crushing resistance. I can easily see this hitting $23 within the next couple of weeks, especially if silver holds strong. Here is a DD on the company: Coeur Mining (CDE) closed the day at $20.5, according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext": "> President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent, in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail. “Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be ‘ripped off’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent,” Trump said in a social media post. > He said there would be a one-year cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20. It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House. > The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that the administration has suggested should not exist and has slashed funding for. Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday. The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November, according to Federal Reserve data, up from 12.9 percent in late 2013.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail . “ Please be informed that we will no_longer let the American Public be ‘ ripped off ’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent ” Trump said in a social media post . He said there would be a oneyear cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20 . It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress . Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders IVt . and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley RMo . would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years . Similar legislation has been introduced in the House . The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau an agency that the administration has suggested should not_exist and has slashed funding for . Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday . The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November according to Federal Reserve data up from 12.9 percent in late 2013 ."

First in class HBM dominance and NAND. I know its trading near 52 week highs, but I think forward PEG of 0.20x compared to sector median of 1.66x makes it compelling, even as I am trying to diversify away from AI stocks. AMD - I just fucking love Lisa Su. I think she's got a shot of rolling out HPC accelerators to give Nvidia's Vera Rubin some competition. The new Instincts and EPYC CPUs are impressive as well. I know its trades at a premium, but its forward PEG is roughly a 25% discount to the sector overall. ALL - Property and casualty insurance is resilient and inelastic. Near 200% YOY growth, implementing AI smartly, attractive valuation, defensive play. INCY - I already own this, but I'm considering buying more because the valuation is just too good. It's diversifying beyond its main product Jakafi, has lots of insider buybacks, low debt, outperforms sector growth, and excellent margins. B - Although I'm a bit skeptical because of gold's exceptional rise, Barrick is one of the largest and most diversified mining companies and I think other metals still have room to run (I'm especially bullish on copper). Record cash flows have improved their balance sheet, and I think the green energy transition, EVs, and increased interest in precious metals due to global instability will help.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I am 22 years old and have been wanting to start investing for more than a year now. I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

      "selftext": "Meta Platforms announced a major deal to support Oklo and TerraPower, providing power for their AI data centers. We’re talking about a 1.2 GW nuclear park in Ohio. OKLO gapped up at the open, rising nearly 15% to 20% pre-market, though it pulled back during the session. As someone who successfully locked in profits pre-market today, seeing this gap up is bittersweet, but it perfectly validates the 'AI + Nuclear' investment thesis. Meta is actually providing upfront funding and prepaying for power. This transforms OKLO from a 'concept stock' into a real project with a major anchor customer and a clear 2030 roadmap. We’re seeing the whole sector rally, with Vistra (VST) up over 13% on the news. While I’m tempted to jump back in, I won’t chase a 20% gap up. I’m watching for a 'gap fill' move or consolidation around the $105 support level. RSI is definitely showing 'overbought' in the short term, but long-term institutional interest has surged. Anyone else catch this move? Are you holding for triple digits to become the new floor, or taking profits on this Meta-fueled hype?",

      "selftext": "I encouraged my mom to invest money over the next five years. Right now she is keeping everything on her bank account with no yield returns. And I told her she could get more money back than getting 2-4% from a bank, if she locks her money away for a year. My own portfolio situation is that of a complete denegerate. AMD, NVIDIA, Nebius Group and IREN Limited. Largest position is AMD by far. Bought at all time highs, so I'm in a hefty minus, but I can handle the volatility and I'm in for at least the next five years, before I start thinking about reallocations or diversification. I don't think I should invest that crazily with my moms money though. She won't invest huge sums. Maybe a 1000 Euro position and the beginning and then a monthly investment of 100 Euro. The first obvious choice for me was the S&P 500 ETF, because that one has had good returns in the last years and I believe in the US economy over the next many years. An alternative is going for a bigger gamble and picking an individual company stock. The four I had in mind were Google, Amazon, META or Broadcom: solid companies, which should continue to grow over the next 5 years and could outperform the S&P 500. And if my bet doesn't pay off, I would cut some of my own positions and give it to my mom, so that she doesn't miss out on at least +7% annually in either case - and obviously not lose any money. Any advice? Just go for the ETF and forget about it? Go with one of the individual stocks and hope for better returns? One look at my own portfolio and you can probably imagine that I would gravitate towards Broadcom. Other stocks to consider? Or a semi-conductor ETF, since I'm a fan of those? Any input is greatly appreciated.",

The four I had in mind were Google Amazon META or Broadcom solid companies which should continue to grow over the next 5 years and could outperform the SP 500 .

      "selftext": "Vanguard's VOO seems to be the default ETF 'hold' and with good reason: it's performance has been exceptionally solid. But, when you look at Blackrock's Australian-founded, internationally-invested ETF IWLD, its upside in every respect seems to be far superior (except for management fees, which are more than offset by total cumulative returns. IWLD has generally tracked VOO very closely. Here are the differences: * Over 5 years, IWLD has, excluding dividends, returned 12.8% (higher), while VOO has returned \\~12.6% (lower) * Over 5 years, IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20% - 1.21% (higher), while VOO has paid 1.10% - 1.20% (lower) * IWLD is ESG screened, so it cuts out the most harmful stocks, while VOO has no screening other than the S&P (it hold's Chevron (fossil fuels) Phillip Morris (tobacco) etc. * VOO's fees are lower (0.03) vs IWLD's (0.2) * IWLD is more diversified, with more mid-sized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US, while VOO is very US, large-cap and tech-stock-heavy * IWLD is less US currency exposed, whereas IWLD (being internationally invested and Australian-based) has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very, very unstable When you look at the two ETFs, IWLD has grown more, returns more in dividends, costs more in fees, is more sustainable, is more diversified and is less currency exposed. On almost every metric, and in aggregate, it is a better fund. Why don't we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets?",

I first bought this stock in February 2025, when it was under $30, and gradually increased my position to 2,700 shares. This Monday, I added more, bringing my total to just over 3,300 shares. First, we have to acknowledge that KTOS is a company primarily engaged in defense and security, and in recent years, with the U.S. government increasing military spending, KTOS has seen steady growth. As a long-term investment, the potential is huge. However, recently, there’s been a lot of hype around it, attracting retail investors. But I felt something wasn’t right. I decided to liquidate all of my KTOS stock before the close. So, do you think I made the right decision?",

I first bought this stock in February 2025 when it was under $ 30 and gradually increased my position to 2700 shares . This Monday I added more bringing my total to just over 3300 shares . First we have to acknowledge that KTOS is a company primarily engaged in defense and security and in recent years with the U.S. government increasing military spending KTOS has seen steady growth . As a longterm investment the potential is huge . However recently there ’ s been a lot of hype around it attracting retail investors . But I felt something wasn ’ t right . I decided to liquidate all of my KTOS stock before the close . So do you think I made the right decision"

      "selftext": "ASML is arguably one of the most important companies in the world, with little to no competition, producing the machines required to produce the chips for companies such TSMC, Apple, etc. The main bear case a few years ago could’ve been reaching a wall after the development of their High-NA EUV manufacturing technique, but they are actively in development of Hyper-NA which is supposed to be able to create sub 1nm chip designs. You have to think that Moore’s law can only go so far and that they eventually will reach a limit to what their lithography machines can do, but at least in the near future I don’t see this company going anywhere, and they are so dominant that I don’t think another company is going to suddenly take up any of their market share. Even if they face some issues over the years, all major chip companies need them to keep making new manufacturing techniques so they can make better chips and can aid them. These companies certainly are going to want to keep refining their chips as demand has only gone up. A lot of the materials they use aren’t in short supply either such as tin and tungsten. Curious as to any opinions on why this wouldn’t be a good pick in the near-long run",

The S&P500 or any of the large equity ETF'S (QQQ, VTI, etc...) are pretty much the best bet for long term investing and will almost certainly go up over time. 2. Gold is in a short term bubble and is not a sound long term investment. Gold will almost certainly go down over time. Where do you guys fall on these opinions? Why? Thanks so much for your thoughts!",

Gold is in a short term bubble and is not_a sound long term investment . Gold will almost certainly go down over time . Where do you guys fall on these opinions Why Thanks so much for your thoughts"

First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

      "selftext": "Nvidia capped a historic 2025 by becoming the world’s most valuable company, riding explosive demand for AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang is now pushing beyond data center AI into physical world applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and AI powered assistants, aiming to embed Nvidia’s hardware and software at every layer of the next AI wave. With record revenue ($57B in a single quarter), a $500B+ order backlog through 2026, with indications from Jensen Huang that this number may actually have increased further resulting from developments since it was first announced, deep partnerships (OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens), and new chips like Vera Rubin in full production, Nvidia is positioning itself to sustain dominance even amid what many believe are overblown bubble concerns. Key risks remain geopolitical, especially China export controls although the recent developments there appear positive. Nvidia’s strategy is a deliberate shift from being the AI infrastructure supplier, which they still dominate, to becoming a de facto platform owner for machine intelligence. By tying chips, software, simulation tools, and industry partnerships together, Nvidia is reducing customer optionality. Once a carmaker, factory, or robot fleet standardizes on Nvidia’s stack, switching costs rise sharply. This makes Nvidia less exposed to an eventual slowdown in AI model training spend and more leveraged to long duration, recurring demand from autonomous systems and industrial deployment. In effect, Nvidia is anchoring itself to physical capital cycles (cars, factories, robots), which evolve more slowly but are harder to displace once embedded which should help reduce eventual true downward pressure when an AI bubble in fact makes an appearance.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO in IBKR Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in 6 months so the last 10 % probably gon na go to JPEA.L if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . I guess I could put the last 20 % in short term treasury then change it in April if I get rejected but Ive negative feeling due to past experience and feel like Im just going to be rejected and also lose on the opportunity cost here .

      "selftext": "I’m gonna be mostly talking about ride share companies/autonomous vehicles manufacturers (uber, Lyft,Waymo ect) I’ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market. With the rise of Waymo and Tesla’s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber, Lyft, and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gonna be in this market. I’m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be. Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere. I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse. The horse was the main way of transportation, everyone owned one. Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car. Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses. This is how car ownership will be. The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver. Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it’s going to be a huge benefit to everyone. We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day. If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides. There’s no point in owning a car. It saves way more than buying a 30k car, insurance and having the liability of owning a car. Now the question is who’s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation. The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end. Think of uber now, like Netflix In the 2010s. They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming. As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing. The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate. We already saw the hbo merger drama. That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion. Tesla, Waymo, uber, Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players. I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall. They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft, while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated. This could also play out the reverse direction (seems less likely) also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers. This will ultimately leave 4-10ish players dominating consumer logistics. The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate (more likely Waymo and Tesla) and wipes everyone else out. I think it’s already too competitive of a space for this to happen. As this story progress we will see companies that haven’t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said: Overall I’m bullish, on Waymo, Tesla, uber, maybe Lyft. I don’t see a great future for ford, GM ECT Thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m gon na be mostly talking about ride share companiesautonomous vehicles manufacturers uber LyftWaymo ect I ’ ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market . With the rise of Waymo and Tesla ’ s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber Lyft and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gon na be in this market . I ’ m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be . Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere . I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse . The horse was the main way of transportation everyone owned one . Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car . Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses . This is how car ownership will be . The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver . Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it ’ s going to be a huge benefit to everyone . We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day . If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides . There ’ s no_point in owning a car . It saves way more than buying a 30k car insurance and having the liability of owning a car . Now the question is who ’ s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation . The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end . Think of uber now like Netflix In the 2010s . They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming . As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing . The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate . We already saw the hbo merger drama . That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion . Tesla Waymo uber Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players . I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall . They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated . This could also play out the reverse direction seems less likely also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers . This will ultimately leave 410ish players dominating consumer logistics . The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate more likely Waymo and Tesla and wipes everyone else out . I think it ’ s already too competitive of a space for this to happen . As this story progress we will see companies that haven ’ t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said Overall I ’ m bullish on Waymo Tesla uber maybe Lyft . I don ’ t see a great future for ford GM ECT Thoughts"

      "title": "$770k to $1M Sprint for 2026",
      "selftext": "Hello all, Please take a look below at this plan and let me know your feedback. I appreciate you taking the time to time to read it. Context: I’m aiming to grow a $770,000 portfolio to $1,000,000 by Dec 31, 2026. I need a 29.8% total return. I’m balancing an advisor’s conservative S&P 500 anchor with my own high-conviction \"Alpha\" plays in the AI infrastructure and Nuclear sectors. Current Market Condition (Jan 9, 2026): Markets are at ATHs. S&P is testing 6,970. Geopolitical \"relief rallies\" are in full swing, but technicals look overextended. The plan: 1. The Allocation (The 50/50 Barbell) * Invested (50% - $385k): Strike-force deployment once the market hits a 1.5% pullback from today’s highs. * Cash Shield (50% - $385k): Held in SNSXX (3.42% yield) for dip-buying and risk mitigation. | Asset | Ticker | Weight | Amount | Strategy | |---|---|---|---|---| | S&P 500 | VOO | 40% | $154,000 | The Anchor (DRIP ON). | | Nasdaq 100 | QQQM | 20% | $77,000 | The Engine (DRIP ON). | | Nuclear/Uranium | NLR | 20% | $77,000 | The Power Bottleneck (DRIP OFF). | | Semiconductors | SMH | 10% | $38,500 | Sector-wide Speed (DRIP OFF). | | NVIDIA | NVDA | 5% | $19,250 | Pure GPU Alpha (DRIP OFF). | | Broadcom | AVGO | 5% | $19,250 | Custom Silicon Lead (DRIP OFF). | 2. The Rule Structure: * The Wait: No buying until VOO hits $629 or QQQM hits $254. I’m looking for 2 consecutive red days or a CPI-induced sell-off (Jan 15) to enter. * The Scalp (Aggressive): I have a $55k short-term capital loss carryover to use this year. At a 5% gain, I will harvest the profit into SNSXX. * The Runner Rule: For the satellites (NVDA, AVGO, NLR, SMH), I will replace Limit Orders with a 2% Trailing Stop once they hit +5% to capture potential parabolic moves. * The Dip Rule: I have 7 waves of $55,000 in cash. If any asset drops 5% from my strike price, I deploy one wave immediately. * The Phasing: If the market stays green, I deploy $55k into VOO/QQQM every 60 days (skipping April due to midterm election year historical soft patch). 3. Why this hits $1M in 2026 * $17.3k in risk-free SNSXX interest. * $55k in tax-neutralized scalps (thanks to the loss carryover). * $158k required from market growth. With NVDA Rubin cycle and Nuclear energy data center demand accelerating, this is the \"Physical AI\" play. Questions for the community: * Is a 2% Trailing Stop too tight for the 2026 \"vibration\" of chips? * Thoughts on skipping the April 1st phase in a midterm election year? * Am I holding too much cash ($385k) given the 29.8% return hurdle?",

At a 5 % gain I will harvest the profit into SNSXX . The Runner Rule For the satellites NVDA AVGO NLR SMH I will replace Limit Orders with a 2 % Trailing Stop once they hit 5 % to capture potential parabolic moves . The Dip Rule I have 7 waves of $ 55000 in cash . If any asset drops 5 % from my strike price I deploy one wave immediately .

      "selftext": "Mobileye to Acquire Mentee Robotics for $900M: Challenging Tesla for the Future of Labor By acquiring Mentee Robotics, Mobileye (MBLY) is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Tesla’s \"Optimus\" project. However, Mobileye is sticking to its \"Android for Cars\" philosophy selling its self-driving software and chips to other brands, **while building its own humanoid robots in-house**. Business Model: Unlike Tesla’s closed ecosystem, Mobileye will continue to provide an open platform (software/chips) for the automotive industry while developing the robot as a specialized internal product. The Technology: The robots use \"mentoring\" AI, meaning they learn tasks from a single human demonstration rather than needing massive amounts of pre-programmed data. The Two-Phase Roadmap Phase 1 (2026–2028): Industrial Labor. The first deployments will hit factories and fulfillment centers to address global labor shortages and handle repetitive physical tasks. Phase 2 (~2030): The Home. The long-term goal is a consumer-facing \"domestic helper\" capable of handling laundry, clearing tables, and providing elderly care.",

      "selftext": "First, I'm not a financial professional and this is not professional investment advice. I'm just looking broadly at the market and I'm a little concerned. Also, I'm not a VOO for lifer, but I don't hate that strategy. It seems to have worked very well in the past. \\--- The S&P 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe. The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62% of the weight, and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI. To make matters a little more concerning, several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt. Basically, I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued (especially Tesla with its ridiculous \\~300 p/e ratio) and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn. That's why I'm moving significant portions of my holdings to a **revenue-weighted** version of the S&P 500. I'm using Invesco's RWL, but there are many others that are basically the same. While their performances historically are damn near identical, revenue-weighted versions of the S&P 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower. For example, while the **top 10** of the normal S&P 500 make up nearly 40% of the fund, for RWL, the **top 24** make up around that much. Sure, it's going to be pretty similar in the long term, but in the short term, it looks like you're going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive. **Edit: I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically.** Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs, and this is no exception. The comparison is 0.03% for Vanguard and 0.39% for Invesco. While the fees are 13x higher, I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification. Because Vanguard's fee rate is so low, I personally haven't felt the difference yet, but **it is there and it is significant**. If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF, I would move to that one in a heartbeat. **Also, in the past, RWL hasn't performed better in down markets historically.** I think that an AI bubble burst would be different, however. RWL simply has less holdings in AI-forward stocks, meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower.",

      "selftext_processed": "First Im not_a financial professional and this is not_professional investment advice . Im just looking broadly at the market and Im a little concerned . Also Im not_a VOO for lifer but I dont hate that strategy . It seems to have worked very well in the past . The SP 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe . The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62 % of the weight and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI . To make matters a little more concerning several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt . Basically I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued especially Tesla with its ridiculous 300 pe ratio and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn . Thats why Im moving significant portions of my holdings to a revenueweighted version of the SP 500 . Im using Invescos RWL but there are many others that are basically the same . While their performances historically are damn near identical revenueweighted versions of the SP 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower . For example while the top 10 of the normal SP 500 make up nearly 40 % of the fund for RWL the top 24 make up around that much . Sure its going to be pretty similar in the long term but in the short term it looks like youre going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive . Edit I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically . Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs and this is no_exception . The comparison is 0.03 % for Vanguard and 0.39 % for Invesco . While the fees are 13x higher I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification . Because Vanguards fee rate is so low I personally havent felt the difference yet but it is there and it is significant . If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF I would move to that one in a heartbeat . Also in the past RWL hasnt performed better in down markets historically . I think that an AI bubble burst would be different however . RWL simply has less holdings in AIforward stocks meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower ."

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term. Holding 6455 shares at $129.99 this is not financial advice just my opinion",

      "selftext": "This is a big deal. For the first time in years, Google's parent company Alphabet has surpassed Apple in market cap, becoming the world's second most valuable company. Is this a temporary blip or the start of a major shift in the Mag7 power rankings? My take: This is a fundamental shift. Apple's problem is that its growth is slowing. The iPhone is a mature product. The Vision Pro is cool, but it's a niche product, not a mass-market game-changer. Their revenue growth is in the low single digits. It's becoming a value stock, not a growth stock. Google, on the other hand, is an AI powerhouse. Their cloud business is growing at 25%+, and they are monetizing AI across their entire ecosystem (Search, YouTube, Android). They have a clear path to double-digit growth for the next 5 years. The market is finally waking up to this. Here's how I see the new Mag7 hierarchy: 1. Microsoft: The undisputed king. Dominant in cloud (Azure) and enterprise AI. 2. Google: The new #2. The purest AI play with a massive moat. 3. Nvidia: The essential hardware provider. The 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush. 4. Amazon: Still a beast in e-commerce and cloud, but facing more competition. 5. Apple: The new 'old tech'. A cash-flow machine, but growth is a question mark. 6. Meta: The wild card. The metaverse is a huge bet. Could be #1 or #7 in 5 years. 7. Tesla: The most volatile. Depends entirely on FSD and robotics. I'm re-weighting my portfolio based on this. I'm trimming my Apple position and adding to Google and Microsoft. I believe the market will continue to reward real AI-driven growth. I have a full valuation model for all 7 of the Mag7 stocks, comparing their growth rates, margins, and P/E ratios. It's how I made this call. Am I crazy for selling Apple? What's your ranking of the Mag7 for the next 5 years?",

      "selftext": "2025 was the year of \"Mag7 or nothing.\" You could literally just buy Nvidia, Apple, Google, or Microsoft and make 20-30% returns. It was almost too easy. But looking at the data for 2026, I'm seeing something different: What's changing: • Emerging markets returned 34.4% in 2025 (outperforming US) • Energy stocks are rallying (JP Morgan estimates US oil potential) • Value stocks are starting to outperform growth • Housing prices are DOWN for the first time in 2+ years • Retail spending is showing signs of fatigue This feels like the beginning of a real market rotation, not just a dip What I'm realizing: The easy money in 2025 was in mega-cap tech. But 2026 might reward investors who are willing to diversify: • Energy (oil prices forecast to average $61/barrel) • Emerging markets (already up 34.4% in 2025) • Real estate (prices down, potentially a buying opportunity) • Retail (some names like ULTA, AEO, GAP are showing strength) I'm not saying sell everything. But I am saying that the playbook from 2025 (just buy Nvidia) might not work in 2026. Am I crazy for thinking this? Or are you seeing the same signs?",

But 2026 might reward investors who are willing to diversify • Energy oil prices forecast to average $ 61barrel • Emerging markets already up 34.4 % in 2025 • Real estate prices down potentially a buying opportunity • Retail some names like ULTA AEO GAP are showing strength Im not_saying sell everything . But I am saying that the playbook from 2025 just buy Nvidia might not_work in 2026 . Am I crazy for thinking this Or are you seeing the same signs"

      "selftext": "Bottom Line Up Front: Counterpart AI doesn’t replace doctors, it helps Medical Doctors, Registered Nurses, and pharmacists act earlier so patients stay home and hospitals stay emty. Disclaimer: This post was written with the assistance of ChatGPT for general discussion only and is not medical, financial, or professional advice. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ How Counterpart AI (Clover AI) is supposed to work. Example patient: 72-year-old with diabetes (DM) and heart failure (CHF) (Step 1): Risk identification The system reviews existing data like: • Medical records (EHR) • Medication history and refills • Prior ER or hospital visits Based on patterns, the patient is flagged as higher risk for a future hospitalization. (Step 2): In-visit prompt During a regular appointment, the doctor may see a short note such as: “Heart failure (CHF) risk trending upward consider labs, medication review, and adherence check.” Nothing replaces clinical judgment. It’s more of a reminder than an alert. (Step 3): Care team follow-up If needed: • The medical doctor adjusts medications • A registered nurse handles follow-ups • A registered pharmacist helps simplify meds or check adherence The idea is that everyone focuses on the same high-risk patients instead of spreading effort evenly. (Step 4): Prevention By catching issues earlier: • Some ER visits may be avoided • Fewer hospital admissions • Better continuity of care Lower costs are a side effect, not the main action. (Why) Why clinicians might actually use something like this • Less time digging through charts • Clearer prioritization of patients • Works within existing workflows In value-based care models, incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume. Big picture: When risk is identified earlier, care teams have a better chance to intervene sooner, potentially avoiding some hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes.",

Why Why clinicians might actually use something like this • Less time digging through charts • Clearer prioritization of patients • Works within existing workflows In valuebased care models incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume . Big picture When risk is identified earlier care teams have a better chance to intervene sooner potentially avoiding some hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes ."

      "title": "Private prisons' stocks tanked as Wall Street expected more ICE detentions last year",
      "selftext": "Here's some of [our report]( The GEO Group and CoreCivic, the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE, seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year’s inauguration of President Donald Trump. But while Trump’s deportation machine had explosive growth, its reach hasn’t lived up to Wall Street expectations. Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected. Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system, and privately run holding facilities, expected to grow even larger. “Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up.” On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes. At the beginning of 2025, contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group seemed particularly well-suited. “This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February. By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement. Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America. “Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst. [Read more]( (no paywall or ads)",

      "selftext_processed": "Heres some of our report The GEO Group and CoreCivic the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year ’ s inauguration of President Donald Trump . But while Trump ’ s deportation machine had explosive growth its reach hasn ’ t lived up to Wall Street expectations . Stock prices for both companies slumped . Despite a series of immigration blitzes and highprofile raids the government didn ’ t use as much detention space as investors expected . Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year with the immigration system and privately run holding facilities expected to grow even larger . “ Once Trump was elected there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger ” said Joe Gomes an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets an investment bank . “ It ’ s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up. ” On his first day in office Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention . Days later the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law the Laken Riley Act made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of lowlevel crimes . At the beginning of 2025 contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty ready to be reactivated . GEO Group seemed particularly wellsuited . “ This is a unique moment in our company ’ s history and we believe we are wellpositioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing transportation electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders ” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February . By summer Trump ’ s “ One Big Beautiful Bill Act ” was signed into law approving $ 170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement . Oddly enough the price of GEO Group ’ s stock which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day then plummeted . At the end of 2025 GEO Group ’ s stock was trading around $ 16 per share down from a high of $ 36.46 on Trump ’ s second day in office . Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America . “ Investors got over their skis ” said Gomes the analyst . Read more no paywall or ads"

      "selftext": "The consensus forecast for 2026 is: GDP growth of 2.5-3%, continued Fed rate cuts, and a \"soft landing\" for the economy.But here's what I think the consensus is missing: Tariff Uncertainty: Trump's tariff policies are a wildcard. If tariffs escalate, inflation could re-caccelerate, forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts. This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama: The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026. If there's a standoff, it could create a mini-crisis. Markets hate uncertainty. Valuation Risk: The S&P 500 is trading at 205% above its long-term trend. That's a historic extreme. While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, mean reversion is a mathematical certainty. The question is when. Geopolitical Escalation: With Trump's aggressive foreign policy (Venezuela, Greenland, etc.), geopolitical risk is elevated. A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction. So, while the consensus is optimistic, I'm cautious. I'm positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025, with potential for a 10-15% correction at some point. What's your base case for 2026? Are you optimistic or cautious? Disclaimer: This is a macro outlook for discussion. If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me, DM me, I will be happy to discuss with everyone",

This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026 . If theres a standoff it could create a minicrisis . Markets hate uncertainty . Valuation Risk The SP 500 is trading at 205 % above its longterm trend . Thats a historic extreme . While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent mean reversion is a mathematical certainty . The question is when . Geopolitical Escalation With Trumps aggressive foreign policy Venezuela Greenland etc . geopolitical risk is elevated . A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction . So while the consensus is optimistic Im cautious . Im positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025 with potential for a 1015 % correction at some point . Whats your base case for 2026 Are you optimistic or cautious Disclaimer This is a macro outlook for discussion . If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me DM me I will be happy to discuss with everyone"

The ‌justices issued ‌one ruling on Friday in a criminal case. The court does not announce in advance what ‌cases will be decided. The challenges to the tariffs in the cases before the Supreme Court were brought by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 U.S. states, most of them Democratic-governed. Trump has said tariffs have made the United States stronger financially. In a social media post on January 2, Trump said a Supreme Court ruling against the tariffs would be a \"terrible blow\" to the United States. Trump invoked the International ‍Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on goods imported from individual countries - nearly every foreign trading partner - to address ‍what he called ⁠a national emergency ⁠related to U.S. trade deficits. He invoked the same law to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.",

      "selftext": "Hello all. I'm trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online. Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info. I'm mostly an invest-and-forget kind of investor, but do play with options a little just for fun (options buy would typically be less than 0.1% of my total investments). For my options \"play\" I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade, which I've had for a couple of decades at least. In ETrade I could sell a position (stock or options) and immediately use that money to buy something else. I moved that account to Schwab (much more modern interface and some nice research tools), and found out I can't do that - I can't spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles. WTF? Is that really a common thing? I'm fairly certain I can sell/buy immediately in my Vanguard account too, but I don't trade actively enough to really say for sure - mostly mutual funds there, so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway. I just never realized, I guess. I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab, then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no interest (if it happens same-day). This was stated in a reddit comment by someone, but I can't find that info in any Schwab documents, so I'm not sure how much to trust it. I didn't set up margin on that account, because I don't want to actually borrow to invest, but maybe ETrade really worked through margin, and I just didn't know? A little more backstory, and I'm hoping I didn't make a rash move: I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation, as right now I've got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies. I'm stuck with two of those (employer-driven), one of which is Fidelity, and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity. ETrade keeps getting moved/bought, and doesn't keep their interface very up-to-date so it just feels old and clunky (and sometimes just doesn't work, although that seems to have been improving lately). Plus, simplifying by having fewer companies would be good. Unfortunately, Fidelity customer service really pissed me off, and they were utterly incompetent - I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved - online didn't work, talking to customer service didn't work, they put in a tech support ticket, and that didn't work, they sent me paper forms but then I'd need to find a place to print and sign... it was a mess. Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes, including the account transfer request, which settled in less than a week. Yay! No simplification for me, however (one company swapped out for another new one, albeit one with a nicer trading platform), and I probably didn't investigate carefully enough -- I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service, which is a bad reason to make a decision. Vanguard would have been easy, but if I move retirement accounts there (possible) I'd have 99% of my assets with one company, which I'm trying to avoid. And their trading platform is terrible. Ugh. It shouldn't be this complicated....",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello all . Im trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online . Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info . Im mostly an investandforget kind of investor but do play with options a little just for fun options buy would typically be less than 0.1 % of my total investments . For my options play I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade which Ive had for a couple of decades at least . In ETrade I could sell a position stock or options and immediately use that money to buy something else . I moved that account to Schwab much more modern interface and some nice research tools and found out I cant do that I cant spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles . WTF Is that really a common thing Im fairly certain I can sellbuy immediately in my Vanguard account too but I dont trade actively enough to really say for sure mostly mutual funds there so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway . I just never_realized I guess . I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no_interest if it happens sameday . This was stated in a reddit comment by someone but I cant find that info in any Schwab documents so Im not_sure how much to trust it . I didnt set up margin on that account because I dont want to actually borrow to invest but maybe ETrade really worked through margin and I just didnt know A little more backstory and Im hoping I didnt make a rash move I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation as right now Ive got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies . Im stuck with two of those employerdriven one of which is Fidelity and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity . ETrade keeps getting movedbought and doesnt keep their interface very uptodate so it just feels old and clunky and sometimes just doesnt work although that seems to have been improving lately . Plus simplifying by having fewer companies would be good . Unfortunately Fidelity customer service really pissed me off and they were utterly incompetent I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved online didnt work talking to customer service didnt work they put in a tech support ticket and that didnt work they sent me paper forms but then Id need to find a place to print and sign ... it was a mess . Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes including the account transfer request which settled in less than a week . Yay No_simplification for me however one company swapped out for another new one albeit one with a nicer trading platform and I probably didnt investigate carefully enough I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service which is a bad reason to make a decision . Vanguard would have been easy but if I move retirement accounts there possible Id have 99 % of my assets with one company which Im trying to avoid . And their trading platform is terrible . Ugh . It shouldnt be this complicated ...."

      "selftext": "I’m 22 years old and just transitioned from an internship to a full-time Software Engineer role making $85k a year in a low tax state. I currently have $12.3k in a brokerage account invested entirely in FXAIX, and I’ve been contributing $100 per week to that account. For my retirement strategy, I have set up my 401k with a 6% pre-tax contribution and a 3% Roth contribution, though I need to be with the company for a full year before they start their 50% match on the first 6%. My immediate goal is to max out my Roth IRA for the 2025 tax year before the April deadline and start on 2026 as well. I’m looking for advice on whether I should stay the course with the long-term index fund approach or if it makes sense to be more aggressive and \"play\" with a portion of my money given my age and career path. I’m also wondering if I should prioritize increasing my 401k contributions further or if I should focus entirely on the Roth IRA and tax advantaged accounts before putting more into my taxable brokerage. I’m open to any feedback and advice! Thanks in advance.",

      "selftext": "I am a U.S. citizen living in Germany. This is nice for many reasons, but causes some real headaches for investment. Long story short, normal U.S. brokers won't let me buy ETFs etc. without a US address, and if I buy the same in Germany I will be double-taxed into oblivion. The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live, and disincentives for \"passive foreign income\" screw expats over. However, buying individual stocks and bonds is not \"passive\" and therefore avoids the double taxation problem. I understand this as a loser's game and would vastly prefer the buy-and-forget index fund approach, but that's not an option for me. So my questions: * Is it possible to \"simulate\" an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds? Or would this take a life-consuming amount of effort to do without massive risk? * Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bond-like accounts (Raisin etc.)? * Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken? **TLDR** I'm hoping to approximate as closely as I can the \"normal\" investing approach that a working person in the USA would take, but I have to do so without \"passive\" index funds.",

So my questions Is it possible to simulate an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds Or would this take a lifeconsuming amount of effort to do without massive risk Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bondlike accounts Raisin etc . Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken TLDR Im hoping to approximate as closely as I can the normal investing approach that a working person in the USA would take but I have to do so without passive index funds ."

      "title": "Meta strikes nuclear power agreements with three companies",
      "selftext": "Source: [ WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Friday it struck 20-year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and ​develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors. Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20%, ‌whereas Vistra rose about 8% in premarket trade. Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure long-term electricity supplies as [artificial ‌intelligence]( and data centers increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades. The company said in a blog it will purchase power from Vistra's Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and lengthen the lifespan ⁠of the plants, which are licensed ‌to run through at least 2036 with one of two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047. Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by ‍Oklo and TerraPower, the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates. SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on site. Critics say they will ​struggle to achieve economies of scale similar to current large reactors. There are no U.S. SMRs ‌in commercial operations yet and the plants will require permits. Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said the plans along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years will \"make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.\" The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035, Meta said. The size ⁠of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 ​GW. In 2024 Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers ​for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power. Meta will help fund TerraPower's development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. ‍The agreement also provides ⁠Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035. TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support rapid deployment of reactors. Meta said its ⁠partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030. The support ‌will help \"early procurement and development\", said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source WASHINGTON Jan 9 Reuters Meta Platforms said on Friday it struck 20year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and ​develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors . Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20 % ‌whereas Vistra rose about 8 % in premarket trade . Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure longterm electricity supplies as artificial ‌intelligence and data centers increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades . The company said in a blog it will purchase power from Vistras Perry and DavisBesse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania . Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and lengthen the lifespan ⁠of the plants which are licensed ‌to run through at least 2036 with one of two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047 . Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by ‍Oklo and TerraPower the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates . SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on site . Critics say they will ​struggle to achieve economies of scale similar to current large reactors . There are no_U.S . SMRs ‌in commercial operations yet and the plants will require permits . Joel Kaplan Metas chief global affairs officer said the plans along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years will make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history . The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035 Meta said . The size ⁠of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 ​GW . In 2024 Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers ​for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power . Meta will help fund TerraPowers development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032 . ‍The agreement also provides ⁠Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035 . TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support rapid deployment of reactors . Meta said its ⁠partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030 . The support ‌will help early procurement and development said Jacob DeWitte Oklo ’ s cofounder and CEO ."

Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic .

      "selftext": "All eyes are on the US Supreme Court today for its ruling on US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against the trade partners of the country. The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, as it has scheduled January 9 as an “opinion day”- the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue. Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on opinion days. The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without Congress's approval. Practical and economic implications : The stakes of the Supreme Court’s decision extend far beyond legal theory. The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships. If the Court invalidates these tariffs, many companies will likely seek refunds, creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government. Moreover, the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations, as the threat of swift, sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table. Notably, certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court’s decision. These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives, albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools. The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $1,100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $1,400 this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank. It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $300 in 2025 and $400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away. The court's decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trump's tariffs. It could, for example, narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, Morgan Stanley's policy strategists wrote earlier this week. It could also give the administration a \"grace period\" to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place. And even if tariffs are fully scaled back, the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels. \"Among other variables, timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios,\" Morgan Stanley wrote.",

      "selftext_processed": "All eyes are on the US Supreme Court today for its ruling on US President Donald Trump ’ s tariffs against the trade partners of the country . The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday as it has scheduled January 9 as an “ opinion day ” the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs . The court does not_announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue . Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 1000 a.m. Eastern Time ET on opinion days . The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act IEEPA to impose tariffs without Congresss approval . Practical and economic implications The stakes of the Supreme Court ’ s decision extend far beyond legal theory . The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships . If the Court invalidates these tariffs many companies will likely seek refunds creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government . Moreover the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations as the threat of swift sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table . Notably certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court ’ s decision . These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools . The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $ 1100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $ 1400 this year according to the Tax Foundation a think tank . It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $ 300 in 2025 and $ 400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away . The courts decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trumps tariffs . It could for example narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit Morgan Stanleys policy strategists wrote earlier this week . It could also give the administration a grace period to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place . And even if tariffs are fully scaled back the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels . Among other variables timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios Morgan Stanley wrote ."

      "title": "Exclusive: Nvidia requires full upfront payment for H200 chips in China, sources say (Reuters)",
      "selftext": "Nvidia is requiring full upfront, non-refundable payment from Chinese customers for its H200 AI chips. Chinese regulators have temporarily asked some firms to pause H200 orders while deciding how many domestic chips must be purchased alongside each Nvidia chip. Chinese demand exceeds supply (orders >2M units vs. \\\\\\~700k available), despite domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend which lag behind the H200 in performance. The policy shifts financial and regulatory risk from Nvidia to Chinese buyers, reflecting Nvidia’s caution after prior losses from sudden export bans. Nvidia is ramping production but capacity expansion is constrained by generational chip transitions and competition for foundry capacity. Nvidia’s payment terms effectively offload geopolitical and regulatory risk onto Chinese customers, protecting cash flow and avoiding inventory write downs. Beijing’s actions toward H200 imports signals a deliberate attempt to subsidize and force adoption of local products while still selectively accessing top tier Nvidia technology. Allowing H200s for commercial use while excluding military, SOEs, and critical infrastructure reflects a is Beijing’s way of balancing AI competitiveness with national security. Strong dependency on Nvidia persists despite heavy investment in domestic chips, Chinese tech giants’ willingness to prepay underscores continued reliance on Nvidia for cutting edge AI training. Rapid reversals in U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures suggest that capital discipline and flexible supply allocation are now core competitive advantages for Nvidia. Full prepayment, high unit prices, and excess demand indicate Nvidia retains exceptional pricing power, even in politically constrained markets which is something few hardware firms can sustain. Nvidia is monetizing Chinese demand while insulating itself from policy whiplash, and China is using regulatory approval to extract industrial policy concessions leaving buyers to absorb the uncertainty in exchange for access to best in class AI compute.",

      "selftext": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT (IIPR, preferred stock IIPR.PRA)? IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and, in simple terms, targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies. Marijuana companies - although a good chunk of states have legalized - are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium, on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space. IIPR has always been profitable and never missed a dividend. Based on their most recent 10Q filing, they have $2.3 billion in assets - mainly the land and facilities they own - to about $340 million in debt. Recently, their income has gone down as - with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity - they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16% of their revenue over the past year. But, even with that hit, their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs. Accordingly, from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $1.8 billion; and, in general, even if all premiums for their rent went away - i.e., their revenues got cut in 1/3 - they would still be profitable. IIPR's common stock is trading down and has a 15% yield right now, which is priced like it will get cut. But, their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal. It has a 9.5% dividend yield - which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends - and is trading at about 5% below par value. Additionally, the preferred stock value issued is only $44 million. With an approximately $1.8 billion equity cushion, it seems like the $44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected. And, to top it off you're getting a 9.5% yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time. But, even if it did get called, because it's currently trading 5% below call value, even then you would still get a return. **Summary**: IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under. You get 9% yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but, even then, you would still get a 5% immediate return on being called.",

      "selftext_processed": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT IIPR preferred stock IIPR.PRA IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and in simple terms targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies . Marijuana companies although a good chunk of states have legalized are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space . IIPR has always been profitable and never_missed a dividend . Based on their most recent 10Q filing they have $ 2.3 billion in assets mainly the land and facilities they own to about $ 340 million in debt . Recently their income has gone down as with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16 % of their revenue over the past year . But even with that hit their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs . Accordingly from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $ 1.8 billion and in general even if all premiums for their rent went away i.e . their revenues got cut in 13 they would still be profitable . IIPRs common stock is trading down and has a 15 % yield right now which is priced like it will get cut . But their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal . It has a 9.5 % dividend yield which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends and is trading at about 5 % below par value . Additionally the preferred stock value issued is only $ 44 million . With an approximately $ 1.8 billion equity cushion it seems like the $ 44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected . And to top it off youre getting a 9.5 % yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time . But even if it did get called because its currently trading 5 % below call value even then you would still get a return . Summary IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under . You get 9 % yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but even then you would still get a 5 % immediate return on being called ."

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

      "selftext_processed": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation . The company is executing a rollup strategy in building products distribution an extremely large fragmented and underdigitized industry . The investment case is less about shortterm housing cycles and more about disciplined MA operational improvement and longterm compounding . QXO operates in building materials distribution with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products . It supplies contractors with products such as shingles insulation siding waterproofing and related materials . Key characteristics of the industry $ 800B total addressable market Highly fragmented dominated by regional operators Low digital penetration Logisticsintensive and relationshipdriven Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital systems and operational discipline . The core of the thesis is management . Brad Jacobs has built multiple largescale industrial platforms United Waste sold for $ 2.5B United Rentals URI became the largest equipment rental company globally XPO Logistics 30x return later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses Jacobs followed a consistent playbook 1 . Enter fragmented industries 2 . Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3 . Standardize operations 4 . Invest heavily in technology 5 . Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."

Circle retains the interest income (after sharing portions with distribution partners like exchanges). The company benefits from a seigniorage-like mechanism in the digital realm-earning interest on reserves while scaling with demand for blockchain-based dollars. Few companies achieve 70%+ annual \"asset base\" growth with near-100% gross margins on the incremental revenue (interest minus minimal costs). Tech giants like Apple or Amazon grow revenue 10-20% in good years; Circle's core driver grew 73% in 2025. Low Risk: Reserves are safe (treasuries) Network Effects: Obvious.. Uniqueness: No other public company has this direct, leveraged exposure to money creation. Payment processors (visa) capture transaction fees; banks capture fractional deposits. Circle effectively monetizes the issuance and holding of private digital cash at scale With fiat money supply going to explode with ~~defence~~ war budget going up 50%, Trump's new Fed Chair coming soon with QE etc.- Circle shareholders might get rich.. 20B stock -for now.

Trump, in a Truth Social post, said he was issuing that directive because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-sponsored mortgage-issuing entities, are flush with cash. It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for clarity. Trump claimed in the post that the move would help restore “affordability,” a word that has become key to Democrats’ political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.

      "selftext": "Hi all, My family has an antiquated tradition of gifting savings bonds to young relatives that I'd like to continue. I know that they're not a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there, but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool, one that stuck with me through the years. I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder, and I'm hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not a gift card. As the US Treasury Department no longer issues paper savings bonds, I'm exploring options from non-US countries. (I really do like the physical paper bond certificate, although it looks to be harder to find these days. Canada made a similar transition.) My base requirements in order (only the first one is absolutely required): \\-Legally purchasable by US citizen with no foreign residencies or dual citizenship \\-Minimum purchase amount $100 - $200 USD (open to going higher if needed, but I'd prefer smaller denominations) \\-Paper bonds issued if possible, electronic is fine but I'm sentimental. \\-Generally stable government in decent financial health, although my risk / reward tolerance is pretty high. Open to developing countries. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I recognize that this tradition is antiquated, but I think it's sweet and nostalgic. Thanks for taking a look.",

I already have an emergency fund and I’m looking to invest for the long term, focusing more on safety and consistency than on short-term gains. I’m planning to start with around €15k and have been looking into ETFs like VTI, VOO, and SPLV. I’m not sure whether it makes sense to split the investment between different ETFs, or how to think about allocation in general. Should I focus mainly on broad market exposure, or does it make sense to set aside a small percentage for something a bit riskier with higher long-term growth potential? I’d really appreciate hearing different perspectives. Investing isn’t something my parents are familiar with (or particularly supportive of), so I’m trying to learn and make a sensible decision on my own. Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you’re willing to share.",

After a very jagged advance to $160 by 2017, the stock was destroyed during the pandemic, falling all the way to 41 by early 2020. The shares recovered, reaching $218 by early 2022. EXPE was then smashed again, declining to $82 by late 2022. From its 2022 peak until February 2025, the stock traced out a large cup formation and then a handle. The shares broke out of this bullish pattern in August, peaking on September 15. What’s interesting: On November 7, EXPE gapped higher on huge volume, peaked a few days later, pulled back to its 10-week exponential, and then bounced again. PE is at 27 currently Currently net positive Latest insider buying (Expedia executive(s)rule 16b-3 , Scott f schenkel 12/15 30507 shares currently at a nav 4.67% gain . Current 6 month change + 68.77 % You could put a stop-loss just under chart and moving-average support at $274. With no overhead resistance, profits at $320.

Now my portfolio's looking juicier than a Cybertruck's design (controversial but profitable, lol). Bought in 2023, rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went \"💎🙌\" mode. Now? Let's just say my gains are giving main character energy. Elon might send rockets to Mars, but my bank account's already on the moon! Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing and let the chaos work its magic. P.S. If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot, my shares would probably moon so hard we'd need a new emoji. 🚀🌕",

Now my portfolios looking juicier than a Cybertrucks design controversial but profitable lol . Bought in 2023 rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went 💎🙌 mode . Now Lets just say my gains are giving main character energy . Elon might send rockets to Mars but my bank accounts already on the moon Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing_and let the chaos work its magic . P.S . If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot my shares would probably moon so hard wed need a new emoji . 🚀🌕"

I am 5-10 years from retirement and still interested in growth (not interested in moving to bonds etc). I need to move about 200K into other investments within my 401K, not all at once obviously. When I buy a stock or an ETF, I know the price at that moment. With a mutual fund I have no idea until the close and then it is too late to get that days price. I am not trying to time but it would annoy me to lose money based on trading today instead of tomorrow or the next day and it will add up. How can I guesstimate the price of a mutual fund at 2:30PM during the trading day (investment directives have to be in before 3PM).",

After the just first week of 2026 Target has rallied over 5% after dropping 31% in 2025, following the backlash surrounding its rollback of DEI initiatives. I’ve been a believer in Target for a while and have been consistently buying shares since October. But my faith in Target is mostly speculative, and I’m making to post to get some thoughts on more formal aspects of Target’s business. My continued faith in the company stems mainly from the fact that girls have always loved Target. Yes this did contribute to a decline in sales as their adherence to Trump’s anti-DEI policies drove away more progressive consumers, which in large part were young women who’ve been one of Target’s primary demographics. But from what I’ve observed, the backlash was more performative than anything, as even in early fall, a lot of girls I knew still saw Target as their preferred retailer (whether it’s for the store aesthetic or products I’m not sure). What did worry me though was Ulta beauty announcing that they were ending their long term partnership with Target, but from what I’ve observed even that doesn’t seem to be a big issue as girls still love stopping by Target and browsing their selection of beauty products.",

I ’ ve been a believer in Target for a while and have been consistently buying shares since October . But my faith in Target is mostly speculative and I ’ m making to post to get some thoughts on more formal aspects of Target ’ s business . My continued faith in the company stems mainly from the fact that girls have always loved Target . Yes this did contribute to a decline in sales as their adherence to Trump ’ s antiDEI policies drove away more progressive consumers which in large part were young women who ’ ve been one of Target ’ s primary demographics . But from what I ’ ve observed the backlash was more performative than anything as even in early fall a lot of girls I knew still saw Target as their preferred retailer whether it ’ s for the store aesthetic or products I ’ m not_sure . What did worry me though was Ulta beauty announcing that they were ending their long term partnership with Target but from what I ’ ve observed even that doesn ’ t seem to be a big issue as girls still love stopping by Target and browsing their selection of beauty products ."

      "selftext": "Hi, I’m 19M from 🇸🇬 Have been manually doing DCA for the past 12 months and decided to set a recurring buy to put a hiatus to the psychological issue of timing the market. I’ve been putting in 400 SGD per month (slightly over 300 USD) and intends of setting a recurring buy every 2 weeks. Right now, this is my plan for the allocation: \\- VOO: 50%, 75 USD every 2 weeks \\- QQQM: 20%, 30 USD every 2 weeks \\- VXUS: 30%, 45 USD every 2 weeks Total: 150 USD every 2 weeks Few questions: 1) Does the allocation make sense? 2) If I intend to venture into healthcare, should I also leave a % of my portfolio for VHT? If so, how much? (I’ve been buying VHT when there’s a dip, but not sure if I should DCA on this as well) Would appreciate any advice from seniors. 🙏",

      "selftext": "Source - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, significantly higher than the $901 billion approved by Congress for 2026, boosting defense stocks, but sparking skepticism among budget experts. Any such increase in the military budget would require congressional authorization, which could pose a challenge, although Trump's Republicans, who hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have shown little appetite for objecting to Trump's spending plans. Trump said in a Truth Social post that he made the decision on 2027 military spending \"after long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives... especially in these very troubled and dangerous times.\" In just the last few days, U.S. forces seized Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro from his country, toppling him from power. The White House has also said that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military. Trump has also deployed U.S. troops to police a number of cities across the country. The news followed a separate Truth Social post from Trump blasting defense companies for producing weapons too slowly. In it he pledged to block defense contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they accelerated production. Trump said the extra spending would be covered by revenues generated by tariffs he has imposed on nearly every country and many industrial sectors, and the U.S. would still be able to reduce its debt and send dividend checks to \"moderate income\" Americans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the proposal would cost $5 trillion through 2035, while adding $5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest. It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now, noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $288 billion in 2025, well below Trump's own estimates, which have fluctuated around $600 billion in recent days.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $ 1.5 trillion significantly higher than the $ 901 billion approved by Congress for 2026 boosting defense stocks but sparking skepticism among budget experts . Any such increase in the military budget would require congressional authorization which could pose a challenge although Trumps Republicans who hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives have shown little appetite for objecting to Trumps spending plans . Trump said in a Truth Social post that he made the decision on 2027 military spending after long and difficult negotiations with Senators Congressmen Secretaries and other Political Representatives ... especially in these very troubled and dangerous times . In just the last few days U.S. forces seized Venezuelas Nicolas Maduro from his country toppling him from power . The White House has also said that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland including potential use of the U.S. military . Trump has also deployed U.S. troops to police a number of cities across the country . The news followed a separate Truth Social post from Trump blasting defense companies for producing weapons too slowly . In it he pledged to block defense contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they accelerated production . Trump said the extra spending would be covered by revenues generated by tariffs he has imposed on nearly every country and many industrial sectors and the U.S. would still be able to reduce its debt and send dividend checks to moderate income Americans . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget a nonpartisan think tank estimated the proposal would cost $ 5 trillion through 2035 while adding $ 5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest . It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal . The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $ 288 billion in 2025 well below Trumps own estimates which have fluctuated around $ 600 billion in recent days ."

      "selftext": "I've recently studied a system used by seasoned traders that effectively transforms T+1 trading into near T+0 trading. Its logic is simple yet powerful: entering during the final 30 minutes of the trading day (the closing period) grants a “first-mover advantage” at the next day's opening. When quantitative funds boost liquidity in the early session, you avoid chasing rallies by instead providing exit liquidity (taking profits). This “six-step stock selection framework” targets mid-cap momentum stocks with specific characteristics: Golden Range: Up 3%-5% by 2:30 PM (indicating strong momentum without overextension). Strong Uptrend: Over 10% gain in the past 30 days. Size & Liquidity: Capped market cap for flexibility, volume ratio > 1. Volume Ratio Filter: Between 5% and 10% to confirm genuine buyer interest, not institutional dumping. Speed is determined by technique; mindset determines long-term success. I've been backtesting this approach and documenting specific signals. I've compiled a simplified pattern analysis and recent case studies. If you'd like to discuss these setups or understand the logic behind the filters, leave a comment and I'll respond.",

If this isn't a huge red flag I don't know what it is. Their CEO said: “I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player. There will be other people that copy us and follow us; they have always copied and followed us.” Also he said : “I think someone will pay ***hundreds of billions of dollars*** to buy ***IonQ*** because it's the right thing for their cloud.\" To me it sounds like pumping! Its crazy. In 2025 (Q2) was a peak of 48$ per share, and during that time of Q2 were some massive sales of shares. Of course they sold at a very good price and took their profits. When your company's stock real value is around a few dollars, and it grows to 40-50$ in a short period of time based on good marketing and hype, and also you have tons of that stock as a insider of course that you're gonna take that big opportunity! They did TIME IN the market. They made millions. Good for them. The insider purchases of shares are a joke, which speaks volumes about how much they believe in their company.

If this isnt a huge red flag I dont know what it is . Their CEO said “ I believe IonQ will be the Nvidia player . There will be other people that copy us and follow us they have always copied and followed us. ” Also he said “ I think someone will pay hundreds of billions of dollars to buy IonQ because its the right thing for their cloud . To me it sounds like pumping Its crazy . In 2025 Q2 was a peak of 48 $ per share and during that time of Q2 were some massive sales of shares . Of course they sold at a very good price and took their profits . When your companys stock real value is around a few dollars and it grows to 4050 $ in a short period of time based on good marketing and hype and also you have tons of that stock as a insider of course that youre gon na take that big opportunity They did TIME IN the market . They made millions . Good for them . The insider purchases of shares are a joke which speaks volumes about how much they believe in their company . Keep pumping the hopium ..."

Some of the AI features will be turned on by default in inboxes, so users will have to opt out if they don’t want them. The company said Gmail will now be able to better summarize emails and suggest responses. Last year, Google’s Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses. One of the new features is “Suggested Replies,” which Google says uses the context of a user’s emails to create one-click responses. It’s an update to a prior tool called “Smart Replies.” The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise. Driven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it’s valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to get your opinions on my current PEA (French equity savings plan) allocation and my long-term investment strategy. For context: I'm 22 years old, still a student, and I invest with a very long-term perspective (15-20 years minimum). I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) on a monthly basis. Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan (PEA): * AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF (DCAM): **38%** * AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF (PAASI): **14%** * BNP Paribas S&P 500 ETF (ESD): **30%** * BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF (ETZ): **18%** So I only hold ETFs, no individual stocks at the moment. I would like your feedback on several points: * What do you think of this overall allocation? * Do you think any ETFs are over- or underweighted? * Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region? * Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation? I'm considering adding a more sector-specific ETF, for example, one focused on armaments/defense, but I'm not sure if it's a good long-term strategy or if it would provide real diversification. Another point: Do you think it's better to remain 100% invested in ETFs, or to add some direct stock investments in the future? Finally, an important point: This post is intended for an international subreddit, and my French equity savings plan (PEA) limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs, such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold. Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Id like to get your opinions on my current PEA French equity savings plan allocation and my longterm investment strategy . For context Im 22 years old still a student and I invest with a very longterm perspective 1520 years minimum . I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollarcost averaging DCA on a monthly basis . Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan PEA AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF DCAM 38 % AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF PAASI 14 % BNP Paribas SP 500 ETF ESD 30 % BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF ETZ 18 % So I only hold ETFs no_individual stocks at the moment . I would like your feedback on several points What do you think of this overall allocation Do you think any ETFs are over or underweighted Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation Im considering adding a more sectorspecific ETF for example one focused on armamentsdefense but Im not_sure if its a good longterm strategy or if it would provide real diversification . Another point Do you think its better to remain 100 % invested in ETFs or to add some direct stock investments in the future Finally an important point This post is intended for an international subreddit and my French equity savings plan PEA limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs such as the SP 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold . Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism ."

KO generates \\~$10B+ in annual FCF, has pricing power globally, and is a dividend aristocrat. **Valuation:** Trading \\~23x earnings, roughly in line with historical averages. Dividend yield \\~3%. **Catalysts:** Rate cuts, defensive rotation, pricing increases in emerging markets. **Risks:** Strong USD impacts international revenue, declining soda consumption in developed markets. **Position:** 500 shares @ 67.45 Not expecting moonshots — just steady returns (even a Swing trade is fine as long as I make small profit).

      "selftext": "Background: I’m 29 years old and currently have about $125k invested across TSP, Roth IRA, and a brokerage. About 20k in debt that I’m paying off (credit card with locked low rate due to SCRA)Very stable job making about 100k p/y My current approach is long-term investing with a heavy focus on growth, and I’m comfortable riding out market ups and downs. I’ve been looking at VOO vs VOOG and trying to think through the tradeoffs. I like the idea of focusing more on growth, but I also understand the benefit of just sticking with a broad S&P 500 fund and keeping expense ratios low. I guess what I’m really asking is: What are the pros/cons of investing in VOO vs VOOG when you have the time to ride the ups and downs? With VOOG being more tech-heavy, does the current AI money being concentrated in a handful of companies make it more unstable looking forward? Are there any big differences tax-wise between holding one vs the other in tax-advantaged accounts (Roth/TSP) vs a taxable brokerage? Does it make more sense to just pick one, or run some mix of the two? Curious what others think, especially anyone who’s held VOOG through different market cycles.",

It ’ s beginning to feel more like a revival meeting than a tech showcase . Maybe I ’ m being cynical but it seems like we ’ ve reached peak “ founder worship ” where success convinces leaders they ’ re messiahs here to save the world . Is this just me feeling the fatigue or am I turning into an old man yelling at clouds This edition of CES also feels a lot like the one just before the internet bubble popped just replace webenabled with AIenabled and we literally have the same vibe ."

      "selftext": "[ I found this post on X with the following caption: \"Gemini moved from 6% to 22% of GenAI web traffic in a year while ChatGPT dropped from 87% to 65% which to me shows user changing behavior. Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace so new AI usage does not require a new habit, a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up.\" \\----- But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else. Gemini has offered 1 year of free\\* subscription to Pro for Indian users. And it's one of the largest markets. So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that. So, it may not be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace. It's simply due to free subscriptions. In that case, there's a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends, given how price sensitive Indians are.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search Chrome Android Workspace so new AI usage does not_require a new habit a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up . But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else . Gemini has offered 1 year of free subscription to Pro for Indian users . And its one of the largest markets . So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that . So it may not_be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search Chrome Android Workspace . Its simply due to free subscriptions . In that case theres a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends given how price sensitive Indians are ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my next play: I am buying $30 calls expiring 1/30 for $SOFI. This play is a reversal/earnings play. SOFI has reached a bottom at the $26 range, and has since bounced to 26.98, where it closed. Here is my thesis: First off, SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking, loans, investing, and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage, borrow, and grow their money. I am bullish for a few reasons: SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters. For example, they added roughly 850k members, bringing the total membership to 11-12 million. SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no longer being just a lender; it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms. SOFI is also adding alternative private-market funds and AI tools to their platform. Now on the financial side of things: SOFI’s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year. Q1 revenue- $772M Q2 revenue- $855M Q3 revenue- $950M Q1 GAAP- $71M Q2 GAAP- $97M Q3 GAAP- $139.4M As you can see, both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year, which is bullish. Management has raised guidance, including forecasts for higher revenue, earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Note: SOFI is down because they had a share offering, big names like Goldman Sachs, BOA, and Citigroup bought. Therefore, smart money is getting in right now. In conclusion, I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes. SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26, showing that it has found support. SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month, so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone this is my next play I am buying $ 30 calls expiring 130 for $ SOFI . This play is a reversalearnings play . SOFI has reached a bottom at the $ 26 range and has since bounced to 26.98 where it closed . Here is my thesis First off SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking loans investing and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage borrow and grow their money . I am bullish for a few reasons SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters . For example they added roughly 850k members bringing the total membership to 1112 million . SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no_longer being just a lender it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms . SOFI is also adding alternative privatemarket funds and AI tools to their platform . Now on the financial side of things SOFI ’ s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year . Q1 revenue $ 772M Q2 revenue $ 855M Q3 revenue $ 950M Q1 GAAP $ 71M Q2 GAAP $ 97M Q3 GAAP $ 139.4M As you can see both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year which is bullish . Management has raised guidance including forecasts for higher revenue earnings and adjusted EBITDA . Note SOFI is down because they had a share offering big names like Goldman Sachs BOA and Citigroup bought . Therefore smart money is getting in right now . In conclusion I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes . SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26 showing that it has found support . SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings ."

      "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase has reached an agreement to take over the Apple Card program from Goldman Sachs, becoming the new issuer of Apple’s co-branded credit card which is one of the largest in the U.S. with roughly $20 billion in outstanding balances. Goldman is selling the card balances at a discount of more than $1 billion, reflecting challenges with credit performance such as delinquency and subprime exposure. JPM plans to launch a new Apple branded savings account. Customers with the Goldman backed Apple savings accounts can choose to stay or switch. Talks began in 2024, and the transition is expected to still take some time. This deal strengthens JPM’s already dominant credit card business while indicating Goldman’s retreat from mass consumer lending. AAPL originally launched the Apple Card with Goldman Sachs in 2019. Goldman’s broader consumer banking efforts incurred heavy losses, prompting it to scale back and seek a buyer for the Apple Card partnership.",

      "selftext": "At CES 2026, fusion startup CFS unveiled plans to build a virtual replica known as a digital twin of its fusion reactor, Sparc, using NVIDIA’s AI and simulation technologies along with Siemens’ engineering and data tools. ￼ This digital twin lets engineers run simulations, test ideas, and compare results with real experiments in a virtual setting, dramatically speeding up the research cycle. ￼ According to CFS leadership, this approach could compress years of manual experimentation into just weeks of virtual optimization, helping accelerate fusion development toward commercial energy. ￼ NVIDIA announced last August that it is an investor when they joined a $863 million series B2 round which has raised billions for CFS to pursue commercial fusion power as a potentially transformative clean energy source.",

      "title": "Trump proposes massive increase in 2027 defense spending to $1.5 trillion to build 'Dream Military'",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting military spending at $1.5 trillion in 2027, citing \"troubled and dangerous times.\" Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea. The 2026 military budget is set at $901 billion. Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested he's open to carrying out military operations in Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba \"is in trouble.\" \"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal. He added that he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon, one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors, if the company did not end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity. Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry, yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eye-popping salaries to top executives. \"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,\" Trump said on social media. \"Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.\" [",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting military spending at $ 1.5 trillion in 2027 citing troubled and dangerous times . Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States . U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea . The 2026 military budget is set at $ 901 billion . Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested hes open to carrying out military operations in Colombia . Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba is in trouble . This will allow us to build the Dream Military that we have long been entitled to and more importantly that will keep us SAFE and SECURE regardless of foe Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal . He added that he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office . Meanwhile Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors if the company did not_end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity . Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eyepopping salaries to top executives . Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment or they will no_longer be doing business with Department of War Trump said on social media . Also if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government under no_circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars until they are able to get their act together ."

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and I'm shorting the fucking Naira",
      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections . If he wins the protections are gone the Naira tumbles . If he wins but Tinubu steals it from him again markets send the naira tumbling anyway ."

The positional inversion in market cap underscores the different directions that Alphabet and Apple are heading in when it comes to their respective strategies for artificial intelligence. Alphabet ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street after putting together the pieces for its AI comeback. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nvidia’s offerings. Then in December, Google introduced Gemini 3 to rave reviews. Shares of Alphabet jumped 65% in 2025, the company’s sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. On Alphabet’s October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined. Meanwhile, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple was supposed to launch the next generation of its Siri AI assistant last year, but the company wound up delaying that release. Apple has promised to launch the “more personal Siri” in 2026.",

Re-buy the another US stock. Specifically: Do you pay FX fees when selling and re-buying (even though funds stay in USD)? Are there commissions or exchange fees per trade? What other costs should I expect (SEC fee, regulatory fees, etc.)? Rough ballpark: if I sell $10k of stock and immediately re-buy $10k, how much do I typically lose to fees?

Rebuy the another US stock . Specifically Do you pay FX fees when selling and rebuying even though funds stay in USD Are there commissions or exchange fees per trade What other costs should I expect SEC fee regulatory fees etc . Rough ballpark if I sell $ 10k of stock and immediately rebuy $ 10k how much do I typically lose to fees Thanks in advance trying to understand if this is worth doing for taxloss harvesting repositioning . how does this compare to Wealthsimple especially considering their FX fees on US stocks"

What I did all last year was keep that 35k as cash, Sell a put or spread, immediately buy SGOV with the premium received, sell SGOV when I need to BTC, profit goes to my core long term hold tickers. I did really well, 45% return in 2025. This year I took that 35k and bought SGOV, increased margin and now my SGOV is my collateral. I only open trades to a max of 35k collateral so I have the funds to cover max loss on everything in SGOV. This seems like I'm borrowing but my cash balance is positive so I don't think I'll be charged interest and I'll actually make a little over $100 a month from SGOV which I was missing out on before. Am I missing something something here? I understand the inherent risks of my strategy but I'm only asking about the use of margin. Setting my borrowing limit to like 100k is scary but I don't think there is any way to actually borrow that much in my current system.",

      "selftext": "Everyone is freaking out because the new Vera Rubin racks are 100% liquid cooled without the need for a mechanical chiller. But, MOD sells dry chillers! In fact, they are probably similar positioned as Vertiv because they sell a range of products that will benefit from the new Vera Rubin server racks. By the way, when a hyperscaler deploys the new Vera Rubin rack, they won't replace all of the chips inside of the building. Probably they will replace the racks section by section as they get inventory. A data center in 2028 will likely have a ton of different chips inside, **most** needing traditional chillers. By the way, people always forget that data centers need redundant cooling products in their buildings due to REGULATION. This is due to ambient heat created from the server racks. Making the products that Vertiv and Modine sell ESSENTIAL to all data centers through the unforeseeable future. If data centers are being deployed, they are getting there products from Vertiv, Mod, TT, etc. Since Monday, the stock is down roughly 14% due to nothing besides this Vera Rubin rack nonsense. Buy back in, we're going to $200 once people realize this. I believe their order backlog will continue to increase because of the reasons above.",

The site becomes Joby’s second facility in Ohio and its third overall, significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint alongside its 435,500 sq ft Marina, California plant. Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027, with longer-term capacity projected at up to \\~500 aircraft annually. For investors, this move highlights Joby’s transition from R&D toward capital-intensive manufacturing, with execution, certification timing, and demand visibility now becoming the key variables to watch.

Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027 with longerterm capacity projected at up to 500 aircraft annually .

      "selftext": "Single family home REITS dropped by 5-10% across the board today after Trump made a comment about how institutional investors such as private equity shouldn't be allowed to buy existing Single family homes. INVH, in particular, is down 9%. Here's why this drop is an opportunity: 1. This hypothetical law, which Trump will need to convince congress to pass, would not even apply to Invitation homes, because they do not buy existing homes, they build new ones to rent out. But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9%. 2. If anything, this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage; competitors such as private equity firms can no longer buy existing homes to rent out. This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent, pushing rents up on their existing homes. On top of this, INVH can continue to build new homes to rent, at better margins now that rents are higher. 3. INVH is trading at an estimated 30-40% discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts. So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multi-year period, shareholders come out ahead. 4. If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes, they won't be able to buy them directly anymore. As a result, there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties. This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH.",

INVH in particular is down 9 % . Heres why this drop is an opportunity 1 . This hypothetical law which Trump will need to convince congress to pass would not_even apply to Invitation homes because they do not_buy existing homes they build new ones to rent out . But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9 % . 2 . If anything this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage competitors such as private equity firms can no_longer buy existing homes to rent out . This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent pushing rents up on their existing homes . On top of this INVH can continue to build new homes to rent at better margins now that rents are higher . 3 . INVH is trading at an estimated 3040 % discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts . So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multiyear period shareholders come out ahead . 4 . If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes they wont be able to buy them directly anymore . As a result there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties . This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH ."

      "selftext": "A company specializing in automotive supply chains made a strategic decision several years ago to heavily support American electric vehicles (primarily Ford and GM). However, both automakers subsequently cut their pure electric projects. In early 2025, this supply chain company initiated major layoffs. Fortunately, its non EV projects remain quite robust. Their primary semiconductor supplier is MU. In the latter half of the year, MU indicated price reductions for 2026, leading the company to be highly optimistic about profitability that year. However, in December, MU announced significant price hikes for all products except one minor adjustment! (MU's stock price has surged 47% since December). This company was swamped before Christmas in December, scrambling to revise budgets. The COO, who had previously assured the board of cost reductions for 2026, now had to explain costs surging 1.5 times. They also had to justify raising prices immediately after setting them with downstream clients like GM and Ford. The COO was stressed to the max. The only silver lining? Their employees immediately bought MU stock. New vehicles will definitely see price hikes in 2026, and the used car market is once again being driven by CVNA.",

This wouldn't have any price movement news or some TV analyst's recommendation news but proper corporate deals / M&A / earnings , etc news that would help you make informed decisions. I know there are platforms that give you news, I might be consuming news for them, but I'll be providing you summarised, short and crisp news that will be barely a few minutes of your read for the entire portfolio plus links to the sources. Would you be willing to try something like this or in future consider to even pay a small subscription fee for this?",

I know there are platforms that give you news I might be consuming news for them but Ill be providing you summarised short and crisp news that will be barely a few minutes of your read for the entire portfolio plus links to the sources . Would you be willing to try something like this or in future consider to even pay a small subscription fee for this"

Simplifying the process, checking prices less often, and accepting that uncertainty is part of the game made investing feel calmer and more sustainable. I’m curious what helped others reach that point. Was it experience, a bad mistake, automation, or simply time in the market?",

For anyone looking for a long term hold in 2026, I think today is a fantastic entry point. Instutitions are buying, multiple institutions just reiterated their buy ratings and have upgraded targets to the $420 to $444 level; it's at $338 today. The stock was beaten back pretty significantly, but just crossed the 200 day MA for the first time since April 2025. Tax loss harvesting is over, they're going to reprice plans which are released end of January on their next earnings call. Also pays a juicy dividend yield. There's many plays out there, but $UNH in 2026 is a really easy buy. Buffet/Berkshire are in, and many top pundits have healthcare as their top pick for 2026. Take a look - I think you'll find it hard to really counter the macro picture in the USA here. Trump's own hedge fund bought. He's going to negotiate drug prices and the industry as a whole which will benefit this. It's the largest insurer in the USA. Good luck to all longs, I think we're easy 35% gain here plus a strong 2.6% div yield. Free money at this point.",

      "selftext_processed": "I wrote about $ UNH back in November and it rallied 30 % . Its dropped down but up 6 % until this morning it dropped back 3 % . For anyone looking for a long term hold in 2026 I think today is a fantastic entry point . Instutitions are buying multiple institutions just reiterated their buy ratings and have upgraded targets to the $ 420 to $ 444 level its at $ 338 today . The stock was beaten back pretty significantly but just crossed the 200 day MA for the first time since April 2025 . Tax loss harvesting is over theyre going to reprice plans which are released end of January on their next earnings call . Also pays a juicy dividend yield . Theres many plays out there but $ UNH in 2026 is a really easy buy . BuffetBerkshire are in and many top pundits have healthcare as their top pick for 2026 . Take a look I think youll find it hard to really counter the macro picture in the USA here . Trumps own hedge fund bought . Hes going to negotiate drug prices and the industry as a whole which will benefit this . Its the largest insurer in the USA . Good luck to all longs I think were easy 35 % gain here plus a strong 2.6 % div yield . Free money at this point ."

      "selftext": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal. These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand, creating a high-probability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early. A typical capitulation involves a rapid, steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out. This is usually confirmed by a volume spike, showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once. Price structure plays a critical role. Key levels like major support zones, trendline holds, or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in. Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal. Risk management is essential tight stop-loss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside. For early entries, it’s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce, bullish candlestick formation, or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in. Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto. For example, when a stock drops 15% in two days, hits a historical support level, and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that’s a strong case for a reversal trade. Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves.",

When doing investing and buying individual name stocks at the low end is it best to check the overall market trend before investing Ex if SPYQQQ is in a rising wedge chances are market is going to fall but lets say you found a stock already near the low end of the channel touching support . People using this strategy how do you manage the conflicting market movement Stick to the induvial stock names and not_the overall market"

      "title": "GLP-1R Agonist due diligence (Novo Nordisk stock analysis)",
      "selftext": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed, possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk. Wanted to post my analysis for critique: For context I have previously just held index funds (S&P 500 & FTSE 100) but with growing fears (believable IMO) of an AI/ Tech bubble and the fact that the S&P 500 is currently 34.43% weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks. My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start. Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP-1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future. They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss & obesity which is a plague of the western word. Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints (morbidity and mortality) like diabetes and heart disease etc. On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile (notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening). I'm not sure if many would disagree with this first point. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP-1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline. Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche, Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera. The horizon includes the oral version of Novo's existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly; Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novo's large molecule oral semaglutide. Lilly also has a triple agonist (retatrutide) which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing. Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II. So as alot of people have alluded to Novo's share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug (Tirzepatide / Mounjaro). I don't have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP-1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below. I have avoided using any forward looking metrics (like PEG or projected EPS) because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know? I've just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals. |**Stock**|**Roche**|**Amgen**|**Pfizer**|**Eli Lilly**|**Novo Nordisk**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Price in USD**|$422.11|$340.55|$25.66|$1,107.89|$57.11| |**Current Price before conversion**|336.40|340.55|$25.66|1,107.89|365.25| |**Market Cap ($)**|342.2B|184.4B|146.5B|1055.0B|253.6B| |**P/E**|28.68|26.37|14.91|54.04|15.6| |**EPS**|11.75|12.94|1.72|20.45|23.33| |**EV/EBITDA**|13.02|13.53|7.83|34.29|10.10| |**Debt / Equity**|1.05|5.67|0.67|1.79|0.60| |**ROIC**|18.54%|10.56%|7.04%|29.95%|42.81%| Not only does Novo have a much better P/E ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share, better value to earnings ratio, better debt to equity ratio. Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years. Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns. So this just means the business is well run and has good financials. But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs? That is definetely a possibility, especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron, but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer. So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly, and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term. Essentially it doesn't need to be see as a 'winner takes all situation' with such a large market. The problem with Lilly is the current price. Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04. It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise. And yes there are other risks for Novo, the standard pharma risks of drugs not working as intended, or intolerable side effects, but this isn't a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised. On the plus side Novo does have other (smaller) facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP-1 Market. I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies (including Lilly and maybe Roche) but weight it towards Novo. I'm not posting this all so you can agree with me, I'm hoping for (hopefully) insightful critiques. What am I not considering?",

      "selftext_processed": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk . Wanted to post my analysis for critique For context I have previously just held index funds SP 500 FTSE 100 but with growing fears believable IMO of an AI Tech bubble and the fact that the SP 500 is currently 34.43 % weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks . My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start . Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future . They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss obesity which is a plague of the western word . Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints morbidity and mortality like diabetes and heart disease etc . On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening . Im not_sure if many would disagree with this first point . Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline . Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera . The horizon includes the oral version of Novos existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novos large molecule oral semaglutide . Lilly also has a triple agonist retatrutide which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing . Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II . So as alot of people have alluded to Novos share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug Tirzepatide Mounjaro . I dont have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below . I have avoided using any forward looking metrics like PEG or projected EPS because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know Ive just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals . StockRocheAmgenPfizerEli LillyNovo Nordisk Price in USD $ 422.11 $ 340.55 $ 25.66 $ 1107.89 $ 57.11 Current Price before conversion336.40340.55 $ 25.661107.89365.25 Market Cap $ 342.2B184.4B146.5B1055.0B253.6B PE28.6826.3714.9154.0415.6 EPS11.7512.941.7220.4523.33 EVEBITDA13.0213.537.8334.2910.10 Debt Equity1.055.670.671.790.60 ROIC18.54 % 10.56 % 7.04 % 29.95 % 42.81 % Not_only does Novo have a much better PE ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share better value to earnings ratio better debt to equity ratio . Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years . Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns . So this just means the business is well run and has good financials . But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs That is definetely a possibility especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer . So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term . Essentially it doesnt need to be see as a winner takes all situation with such a large market . The problem with Lilly is the current price . Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04 . It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise . And yes there are other risks for Novo the standard pharma risks of drugs not_working as intended or intolerable side effects but this isnt a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised . On the plus side Novo does have other smaller facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP1 Market . I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies including Lilly and maybe Roche but weight it towards Novo . Im not_posting this all so you can agree with me Im hoping for hopefully insightful critiques . What am I not_considering"

JP Morgan backs governments major institutions and other banks it literally can not afford to ever really disappear it is backed by states JP consistently posts strong growth figures Good stuff aside it fell more than the SP during 2008 Crisis and Covid but also recovered better The real key point is the second one . Is JP Morgan the perfect ideal investment as well as an investment in Gold as in boom it does super well consistently and is well supported in bust use the increase in Gold price to buy more of the JP lmao"

      "selftext": "Oklo announced today that it has signed a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to support the design, construction, and operation of a radioisotope pilot plant (“Radioisotope Pilot Facility”) under the DOE Reactor Pilot Program (RPP). Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization. “This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction. By building and operating a pilot reactor, we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments, improve regulatory efficiency, and deliver long-term value,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo. Atomic Alchemy Inc., an Oklo subsidiary, is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States. These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer, treating disease, powering medical research, and supporting national security. Today, many are produced overseas or in aging facilities. By first operating a pilot plant, Oklo can then scale into reliable, domestic production that helps ensure hospitals, researchers, and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials. With the OTA now in place, Atomic Alchemy will focus its near-term resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization. As part of this learn-first-then-scale strategy, Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner-1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility. Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security, healthcare infrastructure, and industrial leadership.",

Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization . “ This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction . By building and operating a pilot reactor we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments improve regulatory efficiency and deliver longterm value ” said Jacob DeWitte cofounder and CEO of Oklo . Atomic Alchemy Inc. an Oklo subsidiary is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States . These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer treating disease powering medical research and supporting national security . Today many are produced overseas or in aging facilities . By first operating a pilot plant Oklo can then scale into reliable domestic production that helps ensure hospitals researchers and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials . With the OTA now in place Atomic Alchemy will focus its nearterm resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization . As part of this learnfirstthenscale strategy Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility . Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security healthcare infrastructure and industrial leadership ."

I know we can’t predict the market, so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy. To start, I max out my Roth every year and am 80% invested in QQQ/SPY. I will continue to do that, and I will keep everything there. It’s currently about 30% of total my stock assets. I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio. Mostly tech. I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130% all time. So, I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in. (to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash) Selling out of: FANNG, and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG, TSM, CRWD, etc. (selling about 2/3 of all active portfolio) Keeping: MSFT, MELI, NNOX, PL, SOFI, COST, JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a) they’re my babies and have strong conviction b) moonshot potential c) confidence during recession. Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield, secure ETF/alternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy. Sound reasonable? I’d love feedback",

I know we can ’ t predict the market so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy . To start I max out my Roth every year and am 80 % invested in QQQSPY . I will continue to do that and I will keep everything there . It ’ s currently about 30 % of total my stock assets . I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio . Mostly tech . I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130 % all time . So I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in . to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash Selling out of FANNG and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG TSM CRWD etc . selling about 23 of all active portfolio Keeping MSFT MELI NNOX PL SOFI COST JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a they ’ re my babies and have strong conviction b moonshot potential c confidence during recession . Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield secure ETFalternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy . Sound reasonable I ’ d love feedback"

      "selftext": "A lot of investing discussions focus on finding the “right stock,” but over time I’ve found that long-term results depend more on process than picks. Here are a few principles that seem to matter most: 1) Asset allocation > stock selection How you divide money between equities, bonds, and regions often explains more of your results than individual picks. 2) Compounding beats timing Missing strong market years usually hurts more than avoiding downturns helps. 3) Risk management protects returns Over-leverage, concentration, and emotional decisions can undo years of gains. 4) Behavior > strategy Even good strategies fail if investors panic, chase trends, or abandon plans. 5) Valuation matters long term Buying great businesses at unreasonable prices often leads to mediocre returns.",

      "selftext": "While many investors focus on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country’s reopening, digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Nubank ($NU) represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity. Venezuela’s large population, high mobile penetration, and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize. MercadoLibre, with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago, is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market, offering a growth avenue that isn’t immediately obvious to traditional commodity-focused investors. Similarly, Nubank’s technology-driven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population. Unlike conventional banks, Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, offering low-cost, accessible financial products to millions. If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions, Nubank could expand seamlessly, taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address. This potential remains under the radar compared with the headline-grabbing oil and gas plays. Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America, digital adoption, e‑commerce expansion, and financial inclusion, without relying on oil prices or resource exports. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector, these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela’s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance, potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize.",

      "selftext_processed": "While many investors focus on Venezuela ’ s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country ’ s reopening digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre $ MELI and Nubank $ NU represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity . Venezuela ’ s large population high mobile penetration and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize . MercadoLibre with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market offering a growth avenue that isn ’ t immediately obvious to traditional commodityfocused investors . Similarly Nubank ’ s technologydriven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population . Unlike conventional banks Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil Mexico and Colombia offering lowcost accessible financial products to millions . If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions Nubank could expand seamlessly taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address . This potential remains under the radar compared with the headlinegrabbing oil and gas plays . Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America digital adoption e‑commerce expansion and financial inclusion without relying on oil prices or resource exports . For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela ’ s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize ."

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

On its own thats nothing_magical but they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information . For example 1 most searched movie on Google 8 cents 100 cents Gemini Flash not_released by December 15 23 cents 100 cents 1 most searched athlete 35 cents to 100 cents 2 most searched person 21 cents to 100 cents There ’ s only one explanation they are a Google employee making bank off insider information . And it just so happens a few days ago the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting at least a 50 % score on FrontierMath ’ s Benchmark . So… that ’ s all cool and shit but how do I profit Well let me explain it for you simpletons Im loading up on GOOG calls at open AI is the market cap driver right now and with the Gemini 3.0 release everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But if Gemini can score 70 % on FrontierMath Thats a whole other ball game . That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers . his is a huge deal if this insider is right . They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents . Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something . Even if theyre wrong Google is mopping the floor with everyone else its not_even a competition . Ill have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they dont hit in the next month . Long live Google death to NVDA and thank you Google insider for the free loot .

      "selftext": "Hear me out, not a huge fire sale after today's Goldman Sachs spooking but might not be a bad entry. Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28% Tuesday, their best performance since February, after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference. >The stock is on a tear, leaping more than 47% in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1,080% since hitting a low on April 22. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index Tuesday, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, both of which posted double-digit percentage gains. >“For storage, that is a completely unserved market today,” Huang said at CES Monday. “This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world’s AIs.” >Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jake Silverman. Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said. >Memory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60% to 70% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year. >Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “key beneficiaries” of the push for “AI inferencing and AI at the edge” in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4. Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage “skyrocketing in tandem.” In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology. >“The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending,” Mohan wrote. “As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate.”",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28 % Tuesday their best performance since February after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference . The stock is on a tear leaping more than 47 % in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1080 % since hitting a low on April 22 . It was the best performer in the SP 500 Index Tuesday followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc both of which posted doubledigit percentage gains . “ For storage that is a completely unserved market today ” Huang said at CES Monday . “ This is a market that never_existed and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world basically holding the working memory of the world ’ s AIs. ” Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks according to Bloomberg Intelligence ’ s Jake Silverman . Huang ’ s comments at CES “ suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems ” he said . Memory prices have been steadily climbing . Earlier this week Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60 % to 70 % in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year . Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “ key beneficiaries ” of the push for “ AI inferencing and AI at the edge ” in 2026 Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4 . Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training analytics and compliance purposes with demand for storage “ skyrocketing in tandem. ” In particular he cited growing use in drones surveillance vehicles and sports technology . “ The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models that has created the next wave in hardware spending ” Mohan wrote . “ As we look at 2026 and beyond we expect AI Inference to dominate . ”"

He was going through a litany of things that stop investors from being successful and was clear that boring DCA investing in diverse securities pays better than managed funds 99.999% of the time at 20 years. In that conversation he mentioned that the old joke was that if you wanted to be successful you should put your money into the market and then do nothing. Like don’t move it, don’t change it, don’t mess with it. You are far more likely to mess things up by trading around than you would be if you bought an index fund and then just never sold it. For what it’s worth, I’ve never learned this lesson and now that I’m getting to be older I might just have to try it…",

In that conversation he mentioned that the old joke was that if you wanted to be successful you should put your money into the market and then do nothing_Like don ’ t move it don ’ t change it don ’ t mess with it . You are far more likely to mess things up by trading around than you would be if you bought an index fund and then just never_sold it .

The stock is up over 20% around $1.23, volume is above 1.2M shares, turnover is near 46%, and the day range has expanded beyond 30% (source type: live market data). Those are not normal conditions for a quiet penny stock. Price discovery phases usually come when new information forces participants to reassess assumptions. Over the past two weeks, RIME has delivered a steady flow of concrete updates: SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M, $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts, and multiple major contract expansions including the Apollo Tyres announcement on Jan 6, 2026 (source type: company press releases). I am not trying to predict where this settles. I am watching how the market digests information now that liquidity and attention are both elevated. When you think a stock has entered price discovery mode, do you focus more on intraday structure or on how it behaves over the next few sessions? Do your own digging.",

The stock is up over 20 % around $ 1.23 volume is above 1.2M shares turnover is near 46 % and the day range has expanded beyond 30 % source type live market data . Those are not_normal conditions for a quiet penny stock . Price discovery phases usually come when new information forces participants to reassess assumptions . Over the past two weeks RIME has delivered a steady flow of concrete updates SemiCab ARR up 220 % from $ 2.5M to over $ 8M $ 15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and multiple major contract expansions including the Apollo Tyres announcement on Jan 6 2026 source type company press releases . I am not_trying to predict where this settles . I am watching how the market digests information now that liquidity and attention are both elevated . When you think a stock has entered price discovery mode do you focus more on intraday structure or on how it behaves over the next few sessions Do your own digging ."

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening despite decades of consistent subscriptiondriven growth and high customer retention . The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations . The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI but it will remain durable . Background FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors asset managers wealth firms and corporates . Its product is embedded in client workflows which makes switching painful and churn low . For this reason retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure cutting headcount or seeing AUM decline . FactSet ’ s revenue doesn ’ t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity . Most revenue is subscriptionbased which gives the business strong visibility and predictability . That model has worked for a long time . FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades . Recent Earnings In its most recent fiscal year ended August 31 2025 FactSet reported • Revenue of $ 2.32B up about 5 % year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value ASV growth of 5.7 % • Net income of $ 597M up 11 % • GAAP EPS of $ 15.55 up nearly 12 % • Continued strong free cash flow alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6 % organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $ 2.42–2.45B . Why Stock is Low Margins have come under pressure mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment . FactSet however isn ’ t spending defensively — it ’ s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data . Why that Doesn ’ t Matter A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data . That matters in an AIdriven environment . Many competitors rely more heavily on thirdparty data which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top . FactSet ’ s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for . Position"

      "title": "Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI platform at CES 2026, claims 4x fewer GPUs needed vs Blackwell and 10x lower inference token costs",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some guidance and opinions. I’m a 47 year old small business owner in Pennsylvania. I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025. He’s now 1.5 years old, and I plan to contribute roughly $10,000 per year going forward. I automatically put $100 in each week plus Christmas/birthday money goes in I’ve been trying to do my due diligence, but honestly there’s so much information out there that I’m getting confused, and I’m not confident I’m approaching this the right way. So far he has 6 shares of NVDA, 59 shares of FSELX, 29 shares of FSPGX, 300 shares of HGRAF & 22 shares of KGC. This is meant to be a long-term growth account (college, early adulthood, etc.). I’m open to a “set and forget” approach if that’s the smartest move. I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly second-guessing myself. Should I just VOO or VTI and chill? Thanks in advance! I really appreciate the help!",

I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025 . He ’ s now 1.5 years old and I plan to contribute roughly $ 10000 per year going forward . I automatically put $ 100 in each week plus Christmasbirthday money goes in I ’ ve been trying to do my due diligence but honestly there ’ s so much information out there that I ’ m getting confused and I ’ m not_confident I ’ m approaching this the right way . So far he has 6 shares of NVDA 59 shares of FSELX 29 shares of FSPGX 300 shares of HGRAF 22 shares of KGC . This is meant to be a longterm growth account college early adulthood etc .. I ’ m open to a “ set and forget ” approach if that ’ s the smartest move . I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly secondguessing myself . Should I just VOO or VTI and chill Thanks in advance I really appreciate the help"

The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far. I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not traditional.

      "selftext": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium & Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this: Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing. Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way. ￼ This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security. ￼ You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real. ￼ All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes. ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed. That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress. Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up. Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

      "selftext_processed": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security specifically to Uranium Rare Earths . I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days . Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand . Check this Uranium isn ’ t ripping because of headlines . It ’ s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action . For years the narrative was “ renewables can do it ” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible . That was suppression . Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression . Inventories got drained . Mines stayed closed . Licensing stayed slow . Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing . Now you ’ re seeing the change . Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing deployment and implementation of nuclear energy policies . That hearing isn ’ t symbolic it ’ s strategic . Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can ’ t meet AI and industrial demand any other way . ￼ This isn ’ t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point . This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog . That ’ s the kind of governmentlevel pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security . ￼ You can see markets already moving on this . NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn ’ t just talk congressional heat makes it more real . ￼ All the antinuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue . AI energy demand exposed the grid ’ s limitations and the same committee that has talked about AI ’ s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes . ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression . When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year that signals policy momentum not_posturing . Politicians aren ’ t just parroting soundbites they ’ re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed . That ’ s why uranium is behaving the way it is . This isn ’ t a retail meme rally . This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints . The market was suppressed . Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress . Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it . If they were just talking prices wouldn ’ t care . But this is action . And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up . Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history outside of bitcoin and you all are sleeping .

      "selftext": "Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks). It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA). Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs. Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead. I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors? I'm interested mostly in purchasing rather than shorting, but would enjoy takes on both long term and short term gains.",

We think we’re gonna keep her /s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time. From time to time, I’m in the living room with her watching it. It is…a good show tbh. Great dialogue. I digress. In on episode, Lorelai’s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant. $75,000. A great windfall for sure. But it got me thinking-how could I do something similar for my daughter? What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this. I obviously don’t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai. I, after all, am not a Yale alumnus (lowly state school offspring here) and am not known for making the best picks in the market. I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA. Anyways, how could I go about doing this for my daughter? Some sort of brokerage account for children? Thanks in advance.",

We think we ’ re gon na keep her s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time . From time to time I ’ m in the living room with her watching it . It is…a good show tbh . Great dialogue . I digress . In on episode Lorelai ’ s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant . $ 75000 . A great windfall for sure . But it got me thinkinghow could I do something similar for my daughter What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this . I obviously don ’ t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai . I after all am not_a Yale alumnus lowly state school offspring here and am not_known for making the best picks in the market . I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA . Anyways how could I go about doing this for my daughter Some sort of brokerage account for children Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies. With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio. Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX’s long term growth and stock performance?",

      "title": "SEZL is the BEST setup for 2026: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \\~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \\~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger: # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25). Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY. I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger. **ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:** The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** EDIT: position",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Sezzle SEZL is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026 . 15 Forward PE for 2026 w earnings growing 30 % . Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . NOTE the drop in Sezzle ’ s SEZL Q2 2025 TTM Trailing Twelve Month EPS drop is primarily due to a onetime significant tax benefit in Q2 2024 rolling off the twelvemonth calculation . Operating Income actually grew by 116 % yearoveryear from $ 16.7M in Q2 ‘ 24 to $ 36.1M in Q2 ‘ 25 . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile . At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger . ALSO CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . EDIT position"

      "selftext": "2025 was a very fruitful year for me. All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, the return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some friends in the investment community, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO. Although there were some fluctuations, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become new growth points next year. There is a good chance that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia. I am still closely monitoring the situation and waiting for the right opportunity.",

      "selftext": "One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias. A lot of SemiCab's traction has been in India, and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand. I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like \"nice, but does it work in the U.S.?\" even when the economics are already meaningful. The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release). Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). If that run-rate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography, the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex. Do your own research.",

      "selftext_processed": "One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias . A lot of SemiCabs traction has been in India and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand . I see this all the time with microcaps international wins get treated like nice but does it work in the U.S. even when the economics are already meaningful . The Dec 22 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss . The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100 % to 600 % source type company press release . The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $ 6M described as the largest in SemiCab history and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183 . The release also notes Asian Paints has over $ 4B in annual sales which gives context on customer size source type company press release . Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220 % from $ 2.5M in January to over $ 8M by December and cited a forwardlooking ARR of $ 15M based on current contracts and expansions source type company press release . If that runrate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex . Do your own research ."

      "title": "Trump hands Oil rebuild to US Giants",
      "selftext": "{this is a short term play, im not \"investing\" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years} During the press conference yesterday Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure” *Source:* [Youtube]( Timestamp: 37:25 **1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history** In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant: * ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed. * ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized. * Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational. *Result*? Production fell from \\~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd. **2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like** This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention. **3) Who makes money first?** * **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk. * **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets. * **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty. **Where I put my money** *Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes *Phase 2*: Chevron *Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil **Doubts:** Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done. Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early. About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories. Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours. ⸻ **TL;DR** Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",

      "selftext_processed": "this is a short term play im not_investing in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years During the press conference yesterday Trump said “ We are going to be running it Venezuela with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure ” Source Youtube Timestamp 3725 1 For those who werent around in 2007 quick history In 2007 Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSAcontrolled joint ventures . PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company . Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave . For the US this meant ExxonMobil refused . Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated . Years of arbitration followed . ConocoPhillips refused . Same outcome . Large projects seized . Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational . Result Production fell from 3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd . 2 What a “ rebuild ” actually looks like This is not_about new megaprojects . It starts with fixing what already exists . Workovers on shutin wells . Pipeline repairs and leak control . Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders . Restoring export terminals . Venezuelan crude is extraheavy . You can not produce it without services chemicals and constant intervention . 3 Who makes money first Phase 1 Oilfield services . Short contracts . Fast cash flow . Low political risk . Phase 2 Operators with existing licenses and assets . Phase 3 Majors that demand longterm legal certainty . Where I put my money Phase 1 Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes Phase 2 Chevron Phase 3 ConocoPhillips ExxonMobil Doubts Isnt this all a bit premature Yes absolutely but the stock market doesnt let you wait until its all said and done . Isnt it late already Maybe all these companies are already up ±210 % premarket . But Id say its still early . About Phase 3 players I ’ m unsure how they will react . They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild . I guess they ’ d be repaid by grants for rebuilding . But I ’ m unsure . The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd . Maybe one of you guys has better theories . Do with this as you will . Im in and shared my view . happy to see yours . ⸻ TLDR Trump said “ We are going to be running it Venezuela with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure ” . A rebuild starts with repairs not_new oil dreams . Oilfield services get paid first Chevron benefits next . Exxon and Conoco are optional upside not_the core play . Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but Im in . My bet is on Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes and Chevron for now ."

      "selftext": "Lots of people are talking about oil companies and oil infrastructure companies like CVX, XOM, COP and HAL. We saw some relatively large moves on Friday from these companies potentially foreshadowing the beginning of the Venezuelan Op over the weekend. Potentially more movements to come as the market prices in more US involvement in their oil industry. One trade that is not so obvious and I’m not sure has been considered is Venezuelan currency. With the oil fields opening up and US investment moving in there is going to be a huge increase in the velocity of money. Wages need to be paid, materials need to be purchased etc. How do you think this will be paid for? Bolivar, USD, Stable Coins, Crypto, Ornamental Gourds, Other? You could kind of make a case for any of them",

      "selftext_processed": "Lots of people are talking about oil companies and oil infrastructure companies like CVX XOM COP and HAL . We saw some relatively large moves on Friday from these companies potentially foreshadowing the beginning of the Venezuelan Op over the weekend . Potentially more movements to come as the market prices in more US involvement in their oil industry . One trade that is not_so obvious and I ’ m not_sure has been considered is Venezuelan currency . With the oil fields opening up and US investment moving in there is going to be a huge increase in the velocity of money . Wages need to be paid materials need to be purchased etc . How do you think this will be paid for Bolivar USD Stable Coins Crypto Ornamental Gourds Other You could kind of make a case for any of them"

      "selftext": "The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per) During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?” Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen",

      "title": "The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals).",
      "selftext": "My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally. That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains. My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested. I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era…. The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities. Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market. History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price. That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials. I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure. That’s the bet. TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned. Edit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "My investment thesis is straightforward over the next decade markets will increasingly reward secure politically aligned supply chains not_simply the lowestcost producers . Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy and when that happens pricing capital flows and valuations change structurally . That ’ s why I ’ m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Westernaligned supply chains . My core holdings are Energy Fuels UUUU Cameco CCJ Centrus Energy LEU MP Materials MP and Lynas LYSDY . $ 300k USD invested . I chose these USUS allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities can not easily replace . Together they cover uranium mining nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment and rare earth production and processing outside of China . China controls the majority of these rare earths and following Venezeula supply restrictions are only going to get worse . We ’ re in the hoarding era… . The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story but I think that framing misses the larger signal . Whether oil supply increases or not_is secondary . The more important takeaway is geopolitical the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved . That reinforces a world where energy materials and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than freemarket commodities . Importantly Venezuela does not_pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths . These markets are nothing_like oil . Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through longterm contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance . Rare earths require not_just mining but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop . There is no_mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market . History supports this view . During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run prices did not_rise because of speculative demand alone . They rose because utilities realized they were undercontracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure longterm supply . Once utilities began competing for material prices moved violently and quickly and equities rerated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated . Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was . I expect a very similar situation to take place between 20262028 . After Venezuela the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Skyrocket . Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren ’ t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises . When utilities and governments fear supply disruption they don ’ t negotiate for the best price they secure supply at almost any price . That historical lesson matters today . Nuclear power is expanding globally enrichment capacity is constrained and nonChina rare earth supply remains limited . At the same time geopolitical risk is rising not_falling . If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be riskoff across all assets . But the secondorder effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy subsidies and longterm contracts favoring Westernaligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials . I ’ m not_positioned for a shortterm commodity spike . I ’ m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost just as they did in prior cycles . In those environments uranium and rare earth equities don ’ t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure . That ’ s the bet . TLDR Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets history shows these markets don ’ t reprice gradually they reprice violently when supply security is questioned .

      "selftext": "Edited / reaubmitted to show 20k position. I reported a while back that Deutz is the play. Here is my updated analysis for you to lose granny's inheritance on. **DEUTZ** is the boring German grandpa engine stock that woke up one morning and realised it now owns batteries, drone drives and backup power, but the market still values it like it only sells tractor parts🚜. This grandpa is quietly wiring itself into everything from electrified construction kit to military drone drives and decentralized generators, which means it gets paid whether the world is building roads or preparing for the next crisis. At the same time the German government is funnelling fresh NATO linked defence 🛰️ commitments into broader infrastructure and energy security projects🏗️ so a supplier of engines, gensets and electric drives🪫🔋 sits right in that money river. You are basically buying a slow talking Cologne uncle who just happens to own pick and shovel positions in defense, infrastructure and electrification while everyone else is still staring at shiny pure play defense charts. When the market finally realises this grandpa is not dying but compounding cash flows from multiple policy tailwinds the rerate writes itself.",

DEUTZ is the boring German grandpa engine stock that woke up one morning and realised it now owns batteries drone drives and backup power but the market still values it like it only sells tractor parts🚜 . This grandpa is quietly wiring itself into everything from electrified construction kit to military drone drives and decentralized generators which means it gets paid whether the world is building roads or preparing for the next crisis . At the same time the German government is funnelling fresh NATO linked defence 🛰️ commitments into broader infrastructure and energy security projects🏗️ so a supplier of engines gensets and electric drives🪫🔋 sits right in that money river . You are basically buying a slow talking Cologne uncle who just happens to own pick and shovel positions in defense infrastructure and electrification while everyone else is still staring at shiny pure play defense charts . When the market finally realises this grandpa is not_dying but compounding cash flows from multiple policy tailwinds the rerate writes itself ."

      "title": "BYD +5% after becoming world’s top EV seller with 2.26M units as Tesla deliveries fall 8.6% in 2025",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor. But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game. >The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week. >BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history. >BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market. >In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1. >Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025. >Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers. >Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites. >The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year. >To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features. >Aggressive competition >BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets. >Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars. >BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025. >While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share. >From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%. >Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies. >Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end",

      "selftext_processed": "Source In 2011 Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor . But some 14 years later BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game . The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world ’ s largest seller of EVs according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week . BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs up nearly 28 % from 2024 . Meanwhile Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales Deliveries fell 8.6 % to only 1.6 million recording the biggest annual drop in the company ’ s history . BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not_available for purchase in America while China is Tesla ’ s secondlargest market . In the fourth quarter Tesla ’ s sales came in at about 418000 down 15.6 % from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $ 7500 tax credit expired on October 1 . Unlike other automakers Tesla does not_report its sales by market providing only global figures but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue according to company reports . Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025 . Tesla ’ s deliveries had grown nearly 50 % a year at one point . But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 posting a modest 1 % decline . Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers such a BYD and legacy global automakers as well as backlash against Musk ’ s political activities which angered many potential American and European buyers . Early in the year when Musk was leading the Trump administration ’ s Department of Government Efficiency there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites . The rush to take advantage of the soontoexpire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter . But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year . To try to counter the loss of the tax credit Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars but those versions while costing about $ 5000 less than their “ premium ” equivalents also won ’ t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features . Aggressive competition BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market . The intense __ in China has prompted the Shenzhenbased company to expand further overseas though its lowprice strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets . Growth in BYD ’ s overall sales including EVs and hybrids slowed to its weakest pace in five years with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company ’ s struggles in China the world ’ s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars . BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025 . While China ’ s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers according to HSBC ’ s research . Rivals like Geely China ’ s secondlargest EV maker fastrising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi which debuted its first EV only in 2024 have gradually eroded BYD ’ s domestic market share . From a peak of 35 % in 2023 BYD ’ s market share fell to 29 % in the first 11 months of 2025 according to China Passenger Car Association . In the same period last year its sales declined more than 5 % while Geely ’ s surged nearly 90 % . Wang Chuanfu BYD ’ s founder and CEO attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD ’ s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting according to staterun media . But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies . Shares of Tesla TSLA rose 1.2 % in early trading Friday . Shares closed 2025 up 18.6 % for the year as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk ’ s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “ army ” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon . But so far the rollout of Tesla ’ s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises limited to two metropolitan areas Austin Texas and San Francisco rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year ’ s end"
