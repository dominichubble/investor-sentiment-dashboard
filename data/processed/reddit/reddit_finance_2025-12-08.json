      "selftext": "What if luxury isn’t about logos anymore, but overengineered jackets that repel water and envy? In China—the world’s biggest luxury market—Arc’teryx has exploded as the new status symbol for affluent urbanites who want gear that works. It’s a pivot from ornamental bling (think LV trunks) to “utility-maximizing” flexes, powered by China’s materials-science dominance. In this piece, I break down: • Why frozen-waterfall tech is the hottest thing in humid Shanghai. • How local brands like Laopu Gold are already outpacing Gucci domestically. • The “competence flex”: China’s edge in engineering + cultural export = global moat erosion for European houses. Is “technical luxury” inevitable? Or will heritage hold? Read on and weigh in below—what’s your take on China’s luxury takeover?",

      "title": "DD: Housing May Be the 2026 Trade",
      "selftext": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared? I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House: 1. Road to Housing Act - somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren. It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA. Now the house needs to decide if it’s going to add it on their end. Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good. Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2. FOMC meeting. With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices. If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes, things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not stick thing. I don’t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it. Now, there’s a wrinkle here. We don’t have enough construction workers. So from my POV we have two solutions: 1. Lift the cap on H2B workers - which may be done temporarily via executive order, particularly if a housing emergency is declared. 2. Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses. I think Road To Housing is the key element here. It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing, small houses, and cheaper housing. It couldn’t move forward without the government reopening. The government is open and we may get our rate cut. It passed the senate, and the White House wants the house to add it. I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it’s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms. Stocks I bought (see screenshots): Builders and materials: ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured: CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving: RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren’t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck. Manufactured could be huge here, but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes. The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages, 40/50 yr mortgage ideas get put in action. If Hassett replaces JP we’ll probably get the lower rates. Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff, Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago: I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn’t have the manufactured homes builders. I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off. Not financial advice.",

      "selftext_processed": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House 1 . Road to Housing Act somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren . It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA . Now the house needs to decide if it ’ s going to add it on their end . Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good . Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2 . FOMC meeting . With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices . If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not_stick thing . I don ’ t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it . Now there ’ s a wrinkle here . We don ’ t have enough construction workers . So from my POV we have two solutions 1 . Lift the cap on H2B workers which may be done temporarily via executive order particularly if a housing emergency is declared . 2 . Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses . I think Road To Housing is the key element here . It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing small houses and cheaper housing . It couldn ’ t move forward without the government reopening . The government is open and we may get our rate cut . It passed the senate and the White House wants the house to add it . I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it ’ s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms . Stocks I bought see screenshots Builders and materials ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren ’ t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck . Manufactured could be huge here but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes . The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages 4050 yr mortgage ideas get put in action . If Hassett replaces JP we ’ ll probably get the lower rates . Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn ’ t have the manufactured homes builders . I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off . Not_financial advice ."

      "title": "$112K gift, post tax. What to do with it?",
      "selftext": "I was gifted $112K after taxes and decided to \"blow\" 10% of it. I've spent it on skincare ($2500 on C02 fractional laser on face and neck.I know it sounds mad but the results are stunning) as well as Christmas gifts, travelling home to Europe to see family and about $500 in good clothing). I donated a lot of other good clothes to charities that don't make profits/women's charities that clothe women for back-to-work. I still have 5k left. Now I have 100K and want to invest. Any advice? Also, just am FYI, blowing 10% might seem imsane but we are debt free (am 55/f married to 55/m). Mortgage paid off, paying tuition and housing for 3 kids in college, all cash) and 5 cars bought in cash. I've been working full-time since I was 17, including through university but took 3 years off to have 3 kids then worked from home part-time until all were in middle school, then worked full-time in education to suit their schedules. Didn't make bank doing it but my husband makes good money including pension and healthcare (very grateful for him!) and I was certainly able to contribute financially. Just to add, I scrubbed floors and dishes toale rent when I first moved here so very much appreciate the value of a dollar. We have a lot of money already invested in Europe where we are from and it makes us a lot of money annually but this new money is sort of for me, to do with what I want. But am not wasteful so I know I need to invest the 90%. We live Stateside by the way. My husband manages our investments abroad but feels I should do my own thing with this money (the gift came from his side, not mine so my gratitude is endless). He agrees with my \"blow\" money but definitely advocates me investing for myself. Our European money is a legally binding joint account, we're in it together. I opened a SoFi account but won't even get 4%. Should I invest then with someplace like Merrill Lynch or Schwab? How do I pick shares/stocks or should I let a broker chose? Every day this money is ony checking account (very recent, but still!) is money not working for me. As I said, I'm endlessly grateful for this gift but want to honour the gifter (a very elderly but astute investor herself) by making this money make even more money. I'm not particularly investment savvy.",

Ive spent it on skincare $ 2500 on C02 fractional laser on face and neck.I know it sounds mad but the results are stunning as well as Christmas gifts travelling home to Europe to see family and about $ 500 in good clothing . I donated a lot of other good clothes to charities that dont make profitswomens charities that clothe women for backtowork . I still have 5k left . Now I have 100K and want to invest . Any advice Also just am FYI blowing 10 % might seem imsane but we are debt free am 55f married to 55m . Mortgage paid off paying tuition and housing for 3 kids in college all cash and 5 cars bought in cash . Ive been working fulltime since I was 17 including through university but took 3 years off to have 3 kids then worked from home parttime until all were in middle school then worked fulltime in education to suit their schedules . Didnt make bank doing it but my husband makes good money including pension and healthcare very grateful for him and I was certainly able to contribute financially . Just to add I scrubbed floors and dishes toale rent when I first moved here so very much appreciate the value of a dollar . We have a lot of money already invested in Europe where we are from and it makes us a lot of money annually but this new money is sort of for me to do with what I want . But am not_wasteful so I know I need to invest the 90 % . We live Stateside by the way . My husband manages our investments abroad but feels I should do my own thing with this money the gift came from his side not_mine so my gratitude is endless . He agrees with my blow money but definitely advocates me investing for myself . Our European money is a legally binding joint account were in it together . I opened a SoFi account but wont even get 4 % . Should I invest then with someplace like Merrill Lynch or Schwab How do I pick sharesstocks or should I let a broker chose Every day this money is ony checking account very recent but still is money not_working for me . As I said Im endlessly grateful for this gift but want to honour the gifter a very elderly but astute investor herself by making this money make even more money . Im not_particularly investment savvy ."

      "selftext": "[I created a realistic DCF model using GME's last four quarters.]( Now that GME is net profitable, and the transformation is taking place, it seems useful to project future cashflows based on the current operations from this past year. I created three different scenarios to highlight the different possibilities: * **Bear case $13.36/share**: declining sales, weak traffic, and continued capex cuts for cash preservation. This lower valuation shows GME's resilience through a difficult market. * **Neutral case $18.04/share**: stabilized sales, margins return to historical averages \\~3%, routine store upkeep and slight NWC outflow due to growing inventory from sales. This neutral valuation shows GME's fair price if nothing else really changes. * **Bull case $32.67/share**: Stronger revenue growth, improved operation leverage EBIT margins to 5-6% (historically achievable), more online investments and profitable initiatives (Power Packs), NWC outflows shrinking as inventory turns improve. This shows the upside if GME invests their cash and grows their operations into profitable endeavors. Even in a brutal Bear Case, where revenue slips, margins compress, and working capital works against them, the model still supports a valuation around \\~$13/share. That’s the “everything goes wrong, no turnaround, just pure survival mode” scenario. And GME still doesn’t implode. In the Neutral Case, where the business stabilizes, margins revert to historical norms, and nothing extraordinary happens, the valuation lines up right around \\~$18/share, essentially fairly valued based on what the company is today. But in the Bull Case, where GME executes a modest but realistic operational improvement, better merchandise cycles, cleaner inventory turns, and mid-single-digit EBIT margins, the implied valuation pushes toward \\~$33/share. What’s interesting is that you don’t need hyper growth or moon numbers for that bull scenario. You just need competent execution and reasonable retail economics. The bull case is well within reach if RC can continue focusing on operational improvement. Edit: Updated outstanding shares from 426.5M to 447.91M Edit: Updated D&A rev % on neutral case",

      "selftext_processed": "I created a realistic DCF model using GMEs last four quarters . Now that GME is net profitable and the transformation is taking place it seems useful to project future cashflows based on the current operations from this past year . I created three different scenarios to highlight the different possibilities Bear case $ 13.36share declining sales weak traffic and continued capex cuts for cash preservation . This lower valuation shows GMEs resilience through a difficult market . Neutral case $ 18.04share stabilized sales margins return to historical averages 3 % routine store upkeep and slight NWC outflow due to growing inventory from sales . This neutral valuation shows GMEs fair price if nothing_else really changes . Bull case $ 32.67share Stronger revenue growth improved operation leverage EBIT margins to 56 % historically achievable more online investments and profitable initiatives Power Packs NWC outflows shrinking as inventory turns improve . This shows the upside if GME invests their cash and grows their operations into profitable endeavors . Even in a brutal Bear Case where revenue slips margins compress and working capital works against them the model still supports a valuation around $ 13share . That ’ s the “ everything goes wrong no_turnaround just pure survival mode ” scenario . And GME still doesn ’ t implode . In the Neutral Case where the business stabilizes margins revert to historical norms and nothing_extraordinary happens the valuation lines up right around $ 18share essentially fairly valued based on what the company is today . But in the Bull Case where GME executes a modest but realistic operational improvement better merchandise cycles cleaner inventory turns and midsingledigit EBIT margins the implied valuation pushes toward $ 33share . What ’ s interesting is that you don ’ t need hyper growth or moon numbers for that bull scenario . You just need competent execution and reasonable retail economics . The bull case is well within reach if RC can continue focusing on operational improvement . Edit Updated outstanding shares from 426.5M to 447.91M Edit Updated DA rev % on neutral case"

      "selftext": "Hi all - I bought 160 shares of Palantir in late 2024 in a smaller account. I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested, but I should’ve bought more. Some were purchased at $31 and some were purchased at $43. I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts, a smaller, diversified portfolio, as he has done really well in the stock market. I’ve was pregnant this past year and not looking at my accounts as I didn’t want to make any rash decisions (pregnancy hormones). He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir’s rapid growth was unsustainable. I told him he could sell 10 shares, but I’d really prefer him not to. In June 2025 I told him, I hope you didn’t sell any palantir, and he replied “you’re good.” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares, 60 at $121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $158.65 in August 2025. He didn’t tell me about this, and I didn’t see the emails or check my account so I didn’t find out until last week. Usually I manage my account weekly. Now I only have 20 shares left. In my dads defense, he has made me a lot of money on stocks, so while I am angry at him, he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading. My stock advisor only manages big funds and not individual stocks, so he doesn’t place any trades for me. I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir, at least 30 shares, as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket. I know its trading at $181 but have no problem putting a couple thousand into it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all I bought 160 shares of Palantir in late 2024 in a smaller account . I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested but I should ’ ve bought more . Some were purchased at $ 31 and some were purchased at $ 43 . I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts a smaller diversified portfolio as he has done really well in the stock market . I ’ ve was pregnant this past year and not_looking at my accounts as I didn ’ t want to make any rash decisions pregnancy hormones . He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir ’ s rapid growth was unsustainable . I told him he could sell 10 shares but I ’ d really prefer him not_to . In June 2025 I told him I hope you didn ’ t sell any palantir and he replied “ you ’ re good. ” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares 60 at $ 121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $ 158.65 in August 2025 . He didn ’ t tell me about this and I didn ’ t see the emails or check my account so I didn ’ t find out until last week . Usually I manage my account weekly . Now I only have 20 shares left . In my dads defense he has made me a lot of money on stocks so while I am angry at him he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading . My stock advisor only manages big funds and not_individual stocks so he doesn ’ t place any trades for me . I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir at least 30 shares as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket . I know its trading at $ 181 but have no_problem putting a couple thousand into it ."

Estimating 8% annual return for my given portfolio (conservative estimate) do you think this is feasible, Am I going too risky based on assets choice? Any advice/comments greatly appreciated",

      "selftext": "I posted this on Friday predicting SP inclusion, but the mods deleted it. Anyway… I’ve been studying/trading Carvana for many years. The key to survival has been understanding that the CVNA CEO and his father (who owns nearly 40% of the diluted share count an sits at #42 in the Forbes list) are evil, but extremely clever. They have manipulated both the share price as well as the company’s financials by controlling the float and establishing 4 quarters of profitability via related party transactions. Their end goal was always SP inclusion, which now creates continuous liquidity to turn back on the 10b5-1 trading plan and unload on passive buyers. Due to the conditions that enabled the above, this ain’t a gap up, it’s a supply crisis. Institutions currently own 90-95% of the tradeable float. The actual loose float available is only 10-15 million shares. Tomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply: - Short interest is still ~12M shares. Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover. - MM were selling calls all week on the rumor. With the AH gap to $440, thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM. MM need to buy 2.5M - 3M shares to stay delta neutral. - The SP500 index funds need to buy roughly 16 million shares (approx. $7B) by Dec 19. They can't buy yet, so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them. The level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch. Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18. Buying demand far outweighs supply. It’s hard to say how exactly this plays out, but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique. If I had to guess, CVNA gaps up 15%+ and has the potential to rip higher. I’m expecting a high in the 470-500 range. Absurd, I know, but this is the grand finale of one of the greatest marker manipulations in history. It’ll be fun to watch tomorrow.",

What is thoughts on this somewhat simple portfolio in taxable: * 30% VOO - broad market bucket * 30% SCHG - tilt for growth US large cap * 15% AVDV - tilt for growth international small cap * 15% IDMO - tilt for growth international developed. * 10% BND - this already covers 3 years of expenses And a separate HYSA and cash for another 3 years (same percentage of BND but thats outside of the brokerage). So between BND and HYSA I have 6 years of expenses covered for bad bear runs before tapping growth stocks. Safe withdrawals - I would do safe withdrawals from the tilt growth, every 3 months (1/4 of the yearly expenses), depending on which performed the strongest that quarter. The SWR for expenses (before fun money) is 3.75%. And if I use dividends to cover expenses, the actual selling of stock withdrawal rate is roughly 2.7% to 3% SWR. Normally I would withdraw that quarter from whichever tilt does better, and if that quarter is a bear dip, I would withdraw from the BND (unless VOO had better return) for that 1/4 of the year expenses (like a quarterly paycheck). Most of the dividends from above are qualified mostly I believe, and stocks would be sold under long term cap gains, so married filing jointly, I would be basically at 0% tax rate (with the exception for the fraction of the dividend portion that is ordinary/short term gains). Rebalance - Over the years those stocks above have held nav and grown. So when the market dips, (every 3 months or 6 months) I would sell the least impacted (it would still be at a gain, so not tax loss harvesting) and put that into the needed ticker to rebalance. So if that year I sold mostly from IDMO and AVDV as they did well...then when there is a dip, if VOO for example was only -3% dip vs IDMO -10% vs AVDV -10% (keep in mind its still a gain of the tax lot itself) ... then I would sell some of VOO to buy IDMO and AVDV to get then back up to the portfolio percentages above. So when the market swings back up, they would just get back their gains. This is all in the taxable brokerage. I also have 401k that I will SOSEPP and do roth conversions (since in retirement I would already be in the lowest tax bracket for joint filing). And in 11-14 years would start getting SS. The SS alone would more than cover expenses (using todays numbers with age 62 projected retirement). I can't predict the future surprise costs, so I technically may not need to use SOSEPP /IRA in early retirement....but I will do the SOSEPP for 7 years. This would eat up the IRA mostly as I withdraw from it AND do roth conversions. But its very possible I might not have to touch the taxable brokerage above at all (pure growth with no withdrawals whatsoever except fun/leisure which is probably less than 1% SWR if that. By 59, I could just stop the SOSEPP as the taxable would have grown possible substantially unless a terrible bear run (I moved abroad) and do roth conversions to fully move it over to Roth. Assuming I actually spend from the taxable brokerage (original portfolio at the top). 1 - do those buckets sound okay (as I put emphasis on the tilt growth) with VOO, SCHG, AVDV and IDMO? 2 - does it make sense to spend from the growth tilts (voo less priority) and just rebalance on market dips as they eventually do go back up. 3 - the BND at face value at 10% is low in retirement, but combined with a seperate HYSA, I would have a net total of 6 years of expenses in a bear market. I could access SS as early as 11 years from now (51 currently). Does this make sense? or maybe the BND should go much higher, but I lose out on gains from VOO for example. I still want my overall portfolio to grow in my 50s (so I can enjoy life when not a bad bear market) and then in my mid 60's (once SS comes in) could move money to bonds to 'lock in gains'. If I haven't passed away by then, I don't see myself taking a whole lot of trips in the late 60s and focus more on just quality of life.",

      "selftext_processed": "So quick summary retirement next year at age 52 moving abroad so expenses mapped out for living and medical etc .. What is thoughts on this somewhat simple portfolio in taxable 30 % VOO broad market bucket 30 % SCHG tilt for growth US large cap 15 % AVDV tilt for growth international small cap 15 % IDMO tilt for growth international developed . 10 % BND this already covers 3 years of expenses And a separate HYSA and cash for another 3 years same percentage of BND but thats outside of the brokerage . So between BND and HYSA I have 6 years of expenses covered for bad bear runs before tapping growth stocks . Safe withdrawals I would do safe withdrawals from the tilt growth every 3 months 14 of the yearly expenses depending on which performed the strongest that quarter . The SWR for expenses before fun money is 3.75 % . And if I use dividends to cover expenses the actual selling of stock withdrawal rate is roughly 2.7 % to 3 % SWR . Normally I would withdraw that quarter from whichever tilt does better and if that quarter is a bear dip I would withdraw from the BND unless VOO had better return for that 14 of the year expenses like a quarterly paycheck . Most of the dividends from above are qualified mostly I believe and stocks would be sold under long term cap gains so married filing jointly I would be basically at 0 % tax rate with the exception for the fraction of the dividend portion that is ordinaryshort term gains . Rebalance Over the years those stocks above have held nav and grown . So when the market dips every 3 months or 6 months I would sell the least impacted it would still be at a gain so not_tax loss harvesting and put that into the needed ticker to rebalance . So if that year I sold mostly from IDMO and AVDV as they did well ... then when there is a dip if VOO for example was only 3 % dip vs IDMO 10 % vs AVDV 10 % keep in mind its still a gain of the tax lot itself ... then I would sell some of VOO to buy IDMO and AVDV to get then back up to the portfolio percentages above . So when the market swings back up they would just get back their gains . This is all in the taxable brokerage . I also have 401k that I will SOSEPP and do roth conversions since in retirement I would already be in the lowest tax bracket for joint filing . And in 1114 years would start getting SS . The SS alone would more than cover expenses using todays numbers with age 62 projected retirement . I cant predict the future surprise costs so I technically may not_need to use SOSEPP IRA in early retirement .... but I will do the SOSEPP for 7 years . This would eat up the IRA mostly as I withdraw from it AND do roth conversions . But its very possible I might not_have to touch the taxable brokerage above at all pure growth with no_withdrawals whatsoever except funleisure which is probably less than 1 % SWR if that . By 59 I could just stop the SOSEPP as the taxable would have grown possible substantially unless a terrible bear run I moved abroad and do roth conversions to fully move it over to Roth . Assuming I actually spend from the taxable brokerage original portfolio at the top . 1 do those buckets sound okay as I put emphasis on the tilt growth with VOO SCHG AVDV and IDMO 2 does it make sense to spend from the growth tilts voo less priority and just rebalance on market dips as they eventually do go back up . 3 the BND at face value at 10 % is low in retirement but combined with a seperate HYSA I would have a net total of 6 years of expenses in a bear market . I could access SS as early as 11 years from now 51 currently . Does this make sense or maybe the BND should go much higher but I lose out on gains from VOO for example . I still want my overall portfolio to grow in my 50s so I can enjoy life when not_a bad bear market and then in my mid 60s once SS comes in could move money to bonds to lock in gains . If I havent passed away by then I dont see myself taking a whole lot of trips in the late 60s and focus more on just quality of life ."

      "selftext": "Buying VOO and shorting a few stocks is not for me. As the Mag 7 combined are now ~ 35% of S&P500, VOO has become a less diversified investment. As a principle, I don’t like concentration. TSLA ’s valuation in particular is an outlier. Buying VOO and shorting TSLA (or any other) requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. What if I just don’t own it? I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of S&P493 ( it excludes the Mag 7). Fees are 0.35% so quite more than VOO 0.03% but lower than direct indexing, has no minimum and no headache of transferring assets to another brokerage. It rebalances quarterly. I see one drawback, it’s new and relatively small (67M in assets! ) The bid & ask spread yesterday was a few cents (17 bps). It’s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stock(s).",

I plan to continue this strategy for the rest of my life. Am I behind on where I should be for my age? Should I be investing more? Do you agree with my holding? Should I be more diversified? Will this strategy give me enough for retirement? Any and all thoughts are welcome. Thank you! Edit: also forgot to mention I am a home owner. My brother and I I own a multi family home that we paid 250k for and we purchased about 2 years ago. Still owe 240k on the mortgage. And I also fully own a car that is a 2015 Mazda Cx5.

I also have about 50k in a 401k account that is invested in an allocated fund . I invest 15 % of my paycheck into my 401k which comes to about $ 620 biweekly . I also invest $ 300 a week to my Robinhood account which is evenly distributed to each of my holdings . I am curious to know any and all thoughts you all have on my investing direction . I plan to continue this strategy for the rest of my life . Am I behind on where I should be for my age Should I be investing more Do you agree with my holding Should I be more diversified Will this strategy give me enough for retirement Any and all thoughts are welcome . Thank you Edit also forgot to mention I am a home owner . My brother and I I own a multi family home that we paid 250k for and we purchased about 2 years ago . Still owe 240k on the mortgage . And I also fully own a car that is a 2015 Mazda Cx5 . I have 2k in my bank account for an emergency fund ."

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

This screen gave me 118 stocks (including the Class B shares for GOOG/L).

A lot of moving parts in a short window especially with growth slowing in some regions and inflation still uneven . Should be an interesting few weeks for currencies bonds and equities . Source"

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was *great* and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

      "selftext": "I was born in 1998. My generation hasn’t experienced a serious market drawdown in our adult lifetime. Every asset class has gone up consistently, fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing (QE) that began in 2008. I can’t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be, especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never lived through one. We just dont know what real f*cking market fear is. The new “truth” seems to be that a 10% annual return in the stock market is guaranteed, and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the S&P 500 earnings yield is for fools. I feel like freaking Gandalf, sitting in Minas Tirith, reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed, that no one believes could return. Except in this case, it’s “stocks can actually fall for long periods”. There was a time when stocks were considered risky, and people understood that. Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they’re savings accounts: “10% returns, locked in.” And since we’ve never seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear, I can’t even imagine how badly people will panic. Just a few weeks ago, people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the S&P was still at 5000. God, when I look at my friends and our generation, I can’t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson. There’s an ATH of fools running around thinking they’re f*cking George Soros on Main Street. We need a 1929 event, and we need it now. I don’t care if I have to live in a tent",

Every asset class has gone up consistently fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing QE that began in 2008 . I can ’ t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never_lived through one . We just dont know what real fcking market fear is . The new “ truth ” seems to be that a 10 % annual return in the stock market is guaranteed and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the SP 500 earnings yield is for fools . I feel like freaking Gandalf sitting in Minas Tirith reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed that no_one believes could return . Except in this case it ’ s “ stocks can actually fall for long periods ” . There was a time when stocks were considered risky and people understood that . Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they ’ re savings accounts “ 10 % returns locked in. ” And since we ’ ve never_seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear I can ’ t even imagine how badly people will panic . Just a few weeks ago people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the SP was still at 5000 . God when I look at my friends and our generation I can ’ t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson . There ’ s an ATH of fools running around thinking they ’ re fcking George Soros on Main Street . We need a 1929 event and we need it now . I don ’ t care if I have to live in a tent"

Now, Paramount is said to be considering taking its offer straight to WBD shareholders instead of negotiating solely with management. The logic seems to be that a Paramount deal could have a smoother path through U.S. regulators compared to a full Netflix acquisition. Sources say Paramount was the only bidder willing to go after all of WBD’s assets together the studio, streaming business, and TV networks while Netflix and Comcast were mainly focused on Warner Bros. and HBO Max. At this point it looks like a mix of regulatory risk, deal structure, and shareholder pressure could end up deciding where these assets land. Source:",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m planning to start investing more consistently and could use some perspective from people with more experience. My plan is to invest around €500 every few months, with a long-term horizon (10+ years). I’m not looking for quick gains, mainly preservation of value with a reasonable long-term return. I’ve been considering a few options: Physical gold, but many people say it’s not the best idea right now since it’s at an all-time high. An S&P 500 ETF, but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “too high” to enter. Some Asian/emerging markets ETFs, but opinions on those are mixed as well. So now I’m a bit stuck, it feels like everything is “not a good idea right now,” which doesn’t make sense if I want to invest regularly. Given today’s market conditions, what would you consider a sensible long-term investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not trying to time the market? All advice and perspectives are welcome.",

My plan is to invest around €500 every few months with a longterm horizon 10 years . I ’ m not_looking for quick gains mainly preservation of value with a reasonable longterm return . I ’ ve been considering a few options Physical gold but many people say it ’ s not_the best idea right now since it ’ s at an alltime high . An SP 500 ETF but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “ too high ” to enter . Some Asianemerging markets ETFs but opinions on those are mixed as well . So now I ’ m a bit stuck it feels like everything is “ not a good idea right now ” which doesn ’ t make sense if I want to invest regularly . Given today ’ s market conditions what would you consider a sensible longterm investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not_trying to time the market All advice and perspectives are welcome ."

      "selftext": "In everyday speech, we hear: \"I invested in an apartment,\" \"I invested in a stock,\" \"I invested in gold,\" \"I invested in the dollar.\" But we never hear: \"I invested in the market\" or \"I invested in a greater fool.\" This is because saying \"I invested in X\" implies that X itself can give you something, not the market. Yet today, when people say \"I invested in Bitcoin,\" they use exactly the same sentence as for an apartment, a stock, gold, or the dollar. But in the case of Bitcoin, that sentence is logically impossible. Why? If tomorrow no one on the market wants to buy your Bitcoin anymore, you get absolutely nothing from it. No shelter, no decorative or anti-corrosive material, no cash-flow, no liquidation proceeds, nothing. If there is no next buyer, Bitcoin gives you nothing and you cannot recover anything you put in. This means that only the market can give you something. So the sentence \"I invested in Bitcoin\" is not just inaccurate, it is logically impossible. The only accurate statements are: \"I invested in the next buyer,\" \"I invested in a greater fool,\" or \"I invested in the market.\" Bitcoin advocates usually respond: \"Well, the dollar works exactly the same way! The dollar has no backing, it is only worth something because people believe in it and others want it on the market!\" That sounds correct, but it is not. The dollar is created through credit, that is, debt. That is why dollar debtors (not the market) ultimately provide the return to dollar holders. Here is how it works in real life. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces, for example, a car. You buy the car and pay with dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives the dollars back, it simply deletes them, cancels them from its balance sheet, and they disappear. They are no longer on the market. You got a car, the dollar did its job, and then it vanished. The return came from the company that owed the bank, not from some new buyer of dollars. Here is another example. You pay taxes to the government in dollars. The government uses those dollars to redeem its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are then erased from the Fed’s balance sheet and again are no longer on the market. You received a service, you were able to fulfill your tax obligation, and you do not go to jail. Again, the return (the benefit to you) did not come from the next buyer of dollars but from the extinguishing of debt. With the dollar, there is always a debtor at the end of the chain who must work, produce, or approve tax payments so that the debt is repaid and the dollar disappears. That is why saying \"I invested in the dollar\" is completely accurate and logical. With Bitcoin, there is no such debtor. There is no repayment. There is no extinguishing. Bitcoin is not created through debt and it does not disappear through debt. That is why the difference is enormous. When you say \"I invested in an apartment,\" \"I invested in a stock,\" or \"I invested in the dollar,\" you are telling the truth. When you say \"I invested in Bitcoin,\" you are saying something untrue, something that is logically impossible. Bitcoin cannot be called an investment at all. You can only give money to someone on the market, and be recorded in the Bitcoin database. You are not investing in Bitcoin; you are investing in someone else’s optimism, in someone else’s gullibility, in the hope that the next link in the chain will appear and give you something. You are investing in the greater fool game. And Bitcoin is only a distributed log or scoreboard that tracks this game, not something one invests in.",

      "selftext_processed": "In everyday speech we hear I invested in an apartment I invested in a stock I invested in gold I invested in the dollar . But we never_hear I invested in the market or I invested in a greater fool . This is because saying I invested in X implies that X itself can give you something not_the market . Yet today when people say I invested in Bitcoin they use exactly the same sentence as for an apartment a stock gold or the dollar . But in the case of Bitcoin that sentence is logically impossible . Why If tomorrow no_one on the market wants to buy your Bitcoin anymore you get absolutely nothing_from it . No_shelter no_decorative or anticorrosive material no_cashflow no_liquidation proceeds nothing_If there is no_next buyer Bitcoin gives you nothing_and you can not recover anything you put in . This means that only the market can give you something . So the sentence I invested in Bitcoin is not_just inaccurate it is logically impossible . The only accurate statements are I invested in the next buyer I invested in a greater fool or I invested in the market . Bitcoin advocates usually respond Well the dollar works exactly the same way The dollar has no_backing it is only worth something because people believe in it and others want it on the market That sounds correct but it is not_The dollar is created through credit that is debt . That is why dollar debtors not the market ultimately provide the return to dollar holders . Here is how it works in real life . A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of thin air . The company uses those dollars to pay workers and machines and produces for example a car . You buy the car and pay with dollars . The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan . When the bank receives the dollars back it simply deletes them cancels them from its balance sheet and they disappear . They are no_longer on the market . You got a car the dollar did its job and then it vanished . The return came from the company that owed the bank not_from some new buyer of dollars . Here is another example . You pay taxes to the government in dollars . The government uses those dollars to redeem its bonds held by the Federal Reserve . Those dollars are then erased from the Fed ’ s balance sheet and again are no_longer on the market . You received a service you were able to fulfill your tax obligation and you do not_go to jail . Again the return the benefit to you did not_come from the next buyer of dollars but from the extinguishing of debt . With the dollar there is always a debtor at the end of the chain who must work produce or approve tax payments so that the debt is repaid and the dollar disappears . That is why saying I invested in the dollar is completely accurate and logical . With Bitcoin there is no_such debtor . There is no_repayment . There is no_extinguishing . Bitcoin is not_created through debt and it does not_disappear through debt . That is why the difference is enormous . When you say I invested in an apartment I invested in a stock or I invested in the dollar you are telling the truth . When you say I invested in Bitcoin you are saying something untrue something that is logically impossible . Bitcoin can not be called an investment at all . You can only give money to someone on the market and be recorded in the Bitcoin database . You are not_investing in Bitcoin you are investing in someone else ’ s optimism in someone else ’ s gullibility in the hope that the next link in the chain will appear and give you something . You are investing in the greater fool game . And Bitcoin is only a distributed log or scoreboard that tracks this game not_something one invests in ."

My brain considers investing as an almost 10% guarantee over a 40 year timespan when I retire, with volatility being ironed out by time in the market, but when you apply that to any of the top individual companies, that 10% annual return gives valuations that my brain can’t comprehend and interprets as ludicrous. Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft (or some other company that might take over in the future) or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time? Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size? I believe the stock market will grow more, but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions, it all seems impossible!",

Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft or some other company that might take over in the future or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size I believe the stock market will grow more but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions it all seems impossible"

      "selftext": "Not investment advice to buy. I own shares. Seems like a classic value unlocking play. Why interesting and boring? Well first of all it’s a conglomerate, hence probably wont explode and isn’t for day trading. Interesting? I’ll explain below. They already spun off the materials business back in Oct 2025. Since then the spinoff went up 3% but Honeywell went down 6%. The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace. Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company. Also nobody talks about the quantum stake. They own 54% of Quantinuum. Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price. Quantum computing might be the next AI play? Maybe? Quantinuum might IPO in 2027. Price targets 230-260 USD. Now at 191. The fundementals seem fair here. Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5% dividend. Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow. Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play. Anyone else buying?",

      "selftext": "I’ve twice previously posted on Verticals valuation; this time I want to focus on their quality. If you go to the investors section of Verticals website, you’ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions. I’m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles. Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency. The European equivalent of the FAA. Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords. This following a long career at MI5 (UK equivalent of FBI) where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General. Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025. He was previously the CEO of ATP, Denmark’s national pension plan. These three people have a couple of things in common. First and chief among them is integrity. These are people whose lives are built upon it. The second is that they are not short of options, and yet Dómhnal Slattery, an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board. One final thought, how would the market react if the former head of the FAA, the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers? Massive thanks to Prof G for the “Heads Up”. Adam",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve twice previously posted on Verticals valuation this time I want to focus on their quality . If you go to the investors section of Verticals website you ’ ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions . I ’ m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles . Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency . The European equivalent of the FAA . Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords . This following a long career at MI5 UK equivalent of FBI where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General . Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025 . He was previously the CEO of ATP Denmark ’ s national pension plan . These three people have a couple of things in common . First and chief among them is integrity . These are people whose lives are built upon it . The second is that they are not_short of options and yet Dómhnal Slattery an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years ’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board . One final thought how would the market react if the former head of the FAA the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers Massive thanks to Prof G for the “ Heads Up ” .

      "selftext": "This is the second installment of my effort to summarize some stock ideas from the week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine. Do your own due diligence and research. **WY** Weyerhaeuser is a play on lumber prices and the economic cycle. It is down 24% for the year and 33% from the high but this seems to be a trough for both lumber and for WY. If you believe that the current interest cutting cycle of the Fed will spur housing construction over the next 12-24 months, this is a good time to buy. Some down side protection from WY’s 4% dividend yield and significant analyst support, and the fact that WY doesn’t get much credit for the other profitable and growing parts of its business. Article is written by Andrew Bary who is one of Barron’s better stock pickers IMO. **CASY** Casey’s is the #3 convenience store chain in the US, and considered best in class in their distribution network in the Midwest. The impetus for the recommendation is that convenience stores do better during economic tough times, CASY is a superior operator, and is in growth mode with a plan to enter the Texas market with 1000 stores and increase their store count by a third. Not a cheap stock, it trades at a 30x PE and is near an all time high. **FISV** Fiserv is a service provider to the financial industry and has had a terrible year, halving its earnings forecast earlier this year citing deteriorating conditions in Argentina as a reason for its problems. It trades for a reasonable P/E of 10. Heavy insider buying is the reason Barron’s has highlighted FISV. A companion piece on the 10 worst performing S&P500 stocks in 2025 includes FISV (and names Chipotle (CMG) as the best bounce-back candidate). **AAPL** Two items about Apple this week. First, Apple may be the ultimate winner of the AI game because it has not had to spend any capital on its development. If you believe that AI will eventually be a commodity, then Apple may have made the smartest play by using other companies and hyperscalers (rumored to be Google Gemini) to be its supplier rather than investing hundreds of billions into its development. Second, Apple has a hit with the iPhone 17 but it also is currently killing it in growing services revenue, an analyst says. $300 price target.",

WY Weyerhaeuser is a play on lumber prices and the economic cycle . It is down 24 % for the year and 33 % from the high but this seems to be a trough for both lumber and for WY . If you believe that the current interest cutting cycle of the Fed will spur housing construction over the next 1224 months this is a good time to buy . Some down side protection from WY ’ s 4 % dividend yield and significant analyst support and the fact that WY doesn ’ t get much credit for the other profitable and growing parts of its business . Article is written by Andrew Bary who is one of Barron ’ s better stock pickers IMO . CASY Casey ’ s is the 3 convenience store chain in the US and considered best in class in their distribution network in the Midwest . The impetus for the recommendation is that convenience stores do better during economic tough times CASY is a superior operator and is in growth mode with a plan to enter the Texas market with 1000 stores and increase their store count by a third . Not_a cheap stock it trades at a 30x PE and is near an all time high . FISV Fiserv is a service provider to the financial industry and has had a terrible year halving its earnings forecast earlier this year citing deteriorating conditions in Argentina as a reason for its problems . It trades for a reasonable PE of 10 . Heavy insider buying is the reason Barron ’ s has highlighted FISV . A companion piece on the 10 worst performing SP500 stocks in 2025 includes FISV and names Chipotle CMG as the best bounceback candidate . AAPL Two items about Apple this week . First Apple may be the ultimate winner of the AI game because it has not_had to spend any capital on its development . If you believe that AI will eventually be a commodity then Apple may have made the smartest play by using other companies and hyperscalers rumored to be Google Gemini to be its supplier rather than investing hundreds of billions into its development . Second Apple has a hit with the iPhone 17 but it also is currently killing it in growing services revenue an analyst says . $ 300 price target ."

I have made around 4k over 2025 by doing it and learning more with it. My question is would it be smarter for me to just be investing my money into a roth ira at this age and letting it build over time or just keep doing what i’m doing and push for an earlier retirement through a taxable account, i contribute about 10-12k a year into my taxable account and the amount i’ll invest each year will go up as I get older",

And more importantly I have to say history is not an indicator of the future and as many people have been saying for the past few years, we are due for a pullback.. That pullback may come today or in 5 years. No one knows. The skeptic in me believes while maybe the trend can continue, you never know who will continue their growth, who will falter, who will be the next big thing, who will ink big deals, who will run out of money, who's tech will become superior/inferior, etc. All that to say maybe a tech etf will be safer than choosing the wrong stocks. And s&p is safer than those. But let's take a look at some of those etf's and the mag7: Smh = 48.87% Soxx = 42.70% Dtcr = 28.69% Mag 7 =24.87% Voo = 17.31% Spy = 17.28% 32 nvda 15 Microsoft 4 Amazon 69 Google 12 Meta 20 tsla What conclusions do you draw from this?",

That pullback may come today or in 5 years . No_one knows . The skeptic in me believes while maybe the trend can continue you never_know who will continue their growth who will falter who will be the next big thing who will ink big deals who will run out of money whos tech will become superiorinferior etc .

      "title": "Robinhood froze my ~$160k account 18+ months ago after misreading a police email",
      "selftext": "I’m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don’t want it tied back to my main. About a year and a half ago my ex, who was very abusive, filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her. I’m in Texas, so the cops went all in. They arrested me, searched my house, took all my electronics and paperwork, and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them. The only “drugs” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college, and I had receipts for everything. Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no THC. I was never charged with anything. They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture, so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it. That case is now over. All my property has been returned and there are no charges and no open criminal cases against me. During the investigation, one cop sent a generic “this person is under investigation” email to all my banks and to Robinhood. It was not a court order, not a levy, nothing that said “freeze this account.” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it. Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account. The account is around 160k, mostly in three big stocks I’ve held since the COVID crash. Since then, the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no hold, no lien, no legal freeze, and that they don’t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all. They’ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn’t. Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now. Every time I contact support, I get the same copy-paste answer about “our team is reviewing this, we can’t give a timeline.” I’ve filed complaints with regulators. The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he’s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never any freeze or lien, but he doesn’t really know Robinhood/FINRA stuff and I don’t have money for a second lawyer. Meanwhile I’m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked. Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there’s no court order, no lien, and no seizure according to the city attorney and police, or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win? What legal steps, if any, actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “under review” response? For the hearing on the 15th, I don’t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never any freeze or lien and nothing on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds. I’ve also wondered if it’s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “release” email when the police are saying there was never a freeze in the first place. If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit, I’d like to know whether there’s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it’s caused, or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened. And I’d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of Robinhood/FINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they’re doing.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don ’ t want it tied back to my main . About a year and a half ago my ex who was very abusive filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her . I ’ m in Texas so the cops went all in . They arrested me searched my house took all my electronics and paperwork and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them . The only “ drugs ” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college and I had receipts for everything . Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no_THC . I was never_charged with anything . They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it . That case is now over . All my property has been returned and there are no_charges and no_open criminal cases against me . During the investigation one cop sent a generic “ this person is under investigation ” email to all my banks and to Robinhood . It was not_a court order not_a levy nothing_that said “ freeze this account. ” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it . Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account . The account is around 160k mostly in three big stocks I ’ ve held since the COVID crash . Since then the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no_hold no_lien no_legal freeze and that they don ’ t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all . They ’ ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn ’ t . Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now . Every time I contact support I get the same copypaste answer about “ our team is reviewing this we can ’ t give a timeline. ” I ’ ve filed complaints with regulators . The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he ’ s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never_any freeze or lien but he doesn ’ t really know RobinhoodFINRA stuff and I don ’ t have money for a second lawyer . Meanwhile I ’ m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked . Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there ’ s no_court order no_lien and no_seizure according to the city attorney and police or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win What legal steps if any actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “ under review ” response For the hearing on the 15th I don ’ t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never_any freeze or lien and nothing_on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds . I ’ ve also wondered if it ’ s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “ release ” email when the police are saying there was never_a freeze in the first place . If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit I ’ d like to know whether there ’ s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it ’ s caused or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened . And I ’ d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of RobinhoodFINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they ’ re doing ."

My goal is to keep this amount until I build a savings buffer that I personally feel comfortable with, and then increase my monthly contributions. For context, I already have an emergency fund equal to 6 months of my salary. My current portfolio allocation is: • 85% VWCE • 15% IBIT I want to keep at least 5% IBIT long-term, and I want VWCE to remain my core holding. However, since I’m still young, I’m considering adding a technology ETF or possibly a semiconductor ETF for higher growth potential. If you have a better strategy in mind that fits my profile, feel free to suggest it. Additional info: • My country has no capital gains tax on stocks/ETFs. • I’m currently investing through Trading212, but I plan to move to IBKR once my portfolio reaches a certain size. All opinions and advice are welcome.",

      "selftext": "I have spent the last year working on tools that helps investors do research quickly and understand their own portfolios. Here's some observations on what people say they'll do and what they actually do when the markets get choppy or goes sideways. 1. **The \"I'll buy the dip\" crowd that never does** Everyone has a plan until the markets drop 10%. Then suddenly that cash on the sidelines stay on the sidelines. Even worse is that some sell at the bottom and convince that they will get back in when everything stabilize. They rarely do. The investors who actually benefit from volatility are the ones who automate their buying or have rules they stick to **2. Checking Portfolios way too often** There is some good research on this already and some of you may already aware of it, but watching it in practice is something else. The folks who check daily usually tend to make more changes. More changes usually means worse returns. The one's who check monthly or quarterly tend to be better at riding out the noise and end up better off. **3. Confusing narrative with strategy** \"AI is the future\" is NOT a portfolio strategy. Neither is \"The dollar is collapsing\" or \"real estate always goes up\" or something is a bubble etc. The investors that actually do well tend to have actual rules for allocation, percentages, a thesis, exit strategy etc. The ones chasing themes tend to buy high, panic sell at lows and end up worse than they'd just held a boring index fund. None of this is new, but seeing it play out at our analysis repeatedly made it real in a way that reading about it never did. What behavioral traps have you caught yourself falling into ?",

Even worse is that some sell at the bottom and convince that they will get back in when everything stabilize . They rarely do . The investors who actually benefit from volatility are the ones who automate their buying or have rules they stick to 2 . Checking Portfolios way too often There is some good research on this already and some of you may already aware of it but watching it in practice is something else . The folks who check daily usually tend to make more changes . More changes usually means worse returns . The ones who check monthly or quarterly tend to be better at riding out the noise and end up better off . 3 . Confusing narrative with strategy AI is the future is NOT_a portfolio strategy . Neither_is The dollar is collapsing or real estate always goes up or something is a bubble etc . The investors that actually do well tend to have actual rules for allocation percentages a thesis exit strategy etc . The ones chasing themes tend to buy high panic sell at lows and end up worse than theyd just held a boring index fund . None of this is new but seeing it play out at our analysis repeatedly made it real in a way that reading about it never_did . What behavioral traps have you caught yourself falling into"

      "selftext": "I’ve been taking time off work and during the break I’ve been trying to understand money and investing a bit more deeply, beyond the usual “buy stocks, buy index funds” talking points. Something I keep coming back to is the way interest rates and markets interact. We’re living in a time where interest rates are generally quite low (with some spikes here and there recently), and inflation is mostly kept under control. But if you look back a few decades, high interest rates (double digits) weren’t unusual at all. It made me wonder: are low rates simply the new normal because of how modern economies are structured? Or is this just another phase in a longer cycle? And when interest rates stay low, the money tends to flow into equities and indexes like the S&P 500. Over long stretches, the S&P has massively outperformed other investment avenues from GIC/Precious Metals/Bank Savings, depending on the timeframe you choose. I’m trying to understand if that’s purely because of real economic growth and innovation, or if low rates artificially push valuations up. I’m definitely not saying the S&P is a Ponzi (it clearly represents real companies), but the way it keeps going up almost nonstop made me wonder if there’s a point where the growth stalls, like for ex, what happened to Japan’s Nikkei after its massive boom. So my question is basically: Is the long-term rise of the S&P 500 mostly driven by productivity and innovation, or by monetary policy and liquidity? And if the latter, what happens when liquidity can’t expand forever? Could we ever see a long sideways/down market like Japan, or are the situations too different to compare? I’m just trying to understand how money actually works in the big picture, so any explanation or reading material would be appreciated.",

      "selftext": "Say the Warner Bros deal actually closes, Netflix would effectively win the streaming wars along with YouTube. But winning the streaming wars & doing a transformative M&A deal doesn't mean the stock will go up. Using two examples: Disney acquired Fox for $71 billion & Comcast acquired Sky for $39 billion. Both acquisitions made Disney+ & Peacock more competitive, but both stocks have failed to provide shareholder value over the past 5 years. Disney is down 32% Comcast is down 47% I 100% agree that both companies did strengthen their streaming platforms (Disney+ and Peacock), but none of that translated into shareholder value. Scale improved. Market share improved. Financial performance did not. Megadeals can help the platform, but there is no track record in recent history that it helps the stock. Netflix is facing a similar dynamic. Expect 12 - 18 months of purgatory as they close the deal through regulatory scrutiny. The DoJ striking this deal down could actually help Netflix stock. Debt load will increase dramatically and cash flow will be used to cover interest + debt payments Even if Netflix “wins the deal,” the stock could be stuck in the same 5-year malaise Disney and Comcast experienced after their megamergers. The market rewards operating leverage which is why Netflix outperformed Disney/Comcast in the past 5 years, not media conglomerate complexity. Curious what others think: Does Netflix escape the Disney/Comcast trap or are we about to watch the same movie again?",

But winning the streaming wars doing a transformative MA deal doesnt mean the stock will go up . Using two examples Disney acquired Fox for $ 71 billion Comcast acquired Sky for $ 39 billion . Both acquisitions made Disney Peacock more competitive but both stocks have failed to provide shareholder value over the past 5 years . Disney is down 32 % Comcast is down 47 % I 100 % agree that both companies did strengthen their streaming platforms Disney and Peacock but none of that translated into shareholder value . Scale improved . Market share improved . Financial performance did not_Megadeals can help the platform but there is no_track record in recent history that it helps the stock . Netflix is facing a similar dynamic . Expect 12 18 months of purgatory as they close the deal through regulatory scrutiny . The DoJ striking this deal down could actually help Netflix stock . Debt load will increase dramatically and cash flow will be used to cover interest debt payments Even if Netflix “ wins the deal ” the stock could be stuck in the same 5year malaise Disney and Comcast experienced after their megamergers . The market rewards operating leverage which is why Netflix outperformed DisneyComcast in the past 5 years not_media conglomerate complexity . Curious what others think Does Netflix escape the DisneyComcast trap or are we about to watch the same movie again"

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway had a pretty interesting run this year, especially around the time Warren Buffett announced he would step down as CEO at the end of the year. Before that surprise in early May, BRK.B was actually beating the S&P 500 by a wide margin outperformance of over 22 percentage points in 2025. That changed quickly after the announcement. Over the next three months, the stock slid nearly 15% to a low around $459 in early August. Since then, it’s bounced back about 10% and now sits near $504, putting it up roughly 11% for the year. The problem is the broader market hasn’t slowed down. The S&P 500 is up almost 38% since its April low and nearly 17% year-to-date, closing just a few points below its all-time high. Even with Berkshire’s rebound, it hasn’t been able to catch up with that pace. Feels like a year where the market is rewarding risk and momentum more than steady, conservative names. Curious how others see Berkshire here long-term hold as usual, or starting to fall behind in this kind of market? Source:",

I know The medallion fund was 66% a year, however they still had the restrains of having a large amount of money to move around. So if they were trading individual accounts it probably could have been 100% a year or more potentially. So I want to see if anyone has any idea. I'm thinking 70-120% range",

So if they were trading individual accounts it probably could have been 100 % a year or more potentially . So I want to see if anyone has any idea . Im thinking 70120 % range"

      "selftext": "In the history of human economic relations, wealth and power have always had only two sources: a) you hold a resource others depend on; b) you hold an instrument of someone's obligation (others owe you) Whoever holds the key to someone else’s dependence is free. Whoever depends on others is a slave. Quite simple. If you hold oil, grain, or electricity, people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles, feed themselves, or heat their homes and factories. Without that resource, their normal functioning stops. If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not enough housing, individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price, often handing over a large part of their income for decades. Without access to an apartment, they cannot normally live and work in that city. If you hold supermarket gift cards, airline \"miles,\" casino chips, or shares in a company, the issuers owe you goods, services, cash, dividends, or liquidation proceeds. If you hold dollars or euros, bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory, and the state will be unable to pay its bonds. This is because that money is created through bank loans. Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house. Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory. Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy. That is why millions of people work, sell, and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans. You, who hold that money, don't have to do anything. Others work for you. In all these examples, you possess leverage over others: people must come to you, beg you, work for you, or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations. Bitcoin gives you none of that. It gives you neither a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends (as with energy, housing, or dollars). There is no issuer who owes you anything (as with stocks, casino chips, or gift cards). In short, Bitcoin does not give you control over others. Instead, it gives you control over a number in a shared database. To obtain that \"number,\" you had to give up things that gave you real power: other people's obligations, other people's dependence, other people's fear of being left without what you control. The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin, you traded leverage for emptiness. You no longer have anything that others depend on. All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number. In other words: before, others had to come to you; now you have to beg them. Before, you held an instrument that was someone else's obligation or the key to their functioning. Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no one to anything. You gave up power and received pure dependence. That is why all the talk of \"digital gold,\" \"sovereignty,\" and \"financial freedom\" is just a marketing trick. True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you, when you hold something without which they cannot function or something that obliges them to do something for you. With Bitcoin it is the opposite: you are the one who depends on other people's acceptance, on other people's will. That is not liberation; it is a voluntary entry into slavery.",

Whoever depends on others is a slave . Quite simple . If you hold oil grain or electricity people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles feed themselves or heat their homes and factories . Without that resource their normal functioning stops . If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not_enough housing individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price often handing over a large part of their income for decades . Without access to an apartment they can not normally live and work in that city . If you hold supermarket gift cards airline miles casino chips or shares in a company the issuers owe you goods services cash dividends or liquidation proceeds . If you hold dollars or euros bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory and the state will be unable to pay its bonds . This is because that money is created through bank loans . Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house . Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory . Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy . That is why millions of people work sell and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans . You who hold that money dont have to do anything . Others work for you . In all these examples you possess leverage over others people must come to you beg you work for you or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations . Bitcoin gives you none of that . It gives you neither_a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends as with energy housing or dollars . There is no_issuer who owes you anything as with stocks casino chips or gift cards . In short Bitcoin does not_give you control over others . Instead it gives you control over a number in a shared database . To obtain that number you had to give up things that gave you real power other peoples obligations other peoples dependence other peoples fear of being left without what you control . The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin you traded leverage for emptiness . You no_longer have anything that others depend on . All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number . In other words before others had to come to you now you have to beg them . Before you held an instrument that was someone elses obligation or the key to their functioning . Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no_one to anything . You gave up power and received pure dependence . That is why all the talk of digital gold sovereignty and financial freedom is just a marketing trick . True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you when you hold something without which they can not function or something that obliges them to do something for you . With Bitcoin it is the opposite you are the one who depends on other peoples acceptance on other peoples will . That is not_liberation it is a voluntary entry into slavery ."

Out of the 12 voting members on the FOMC, five have openly pushed back against further easing, while three members of the Board of Governors are in favor of cutting rates. Markets are still largely expecting a cut, but this level of internal disagreement raises big questions about what Jerome Powell might signal going forward.

As I was 100% convinced it would go down, I wanted to figure how to establish a bearish position. Unfortunately, as a long-only investor, I had no experience in doing this, so I thought asked this subreddit how best to achieve this exposure. * Most of the posters called me crazy. * Some agreed with my thesis but advised me not to pursue this: they were right. * Some thought MSTR would continue to moon. * Some suggested inverse ETFs. * Some suggested puts. Ultimately, I decided to sit this out. However, so that I could be prepared the next time an opportunity presented itself, I decided to follow the outcomes of various strategies I would have considered. As you probably know, being bearish on a stock not only requires that you are directionally correct, but that you are on point with the timing as well because you otherwise get gaped by exorbitant interest (with shorts), volatility decay (with inverse ETFs), or theta decay (with options). To make sure I didn't cherry pick the perfect time points, I chose **exactly one year** (12/7/24 to 12/6/25) for each of these securities. For the put options, I chose one- and two-year January dated expirations with round numbers (all initial prices adjusted for reverse splits). Note that the specific options denoted in asterisk have extremely low volumes: |Ticker|Strategy|Position|Initial|Current|% Change| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |[MSTR](|Underlying Stock|Long|395.01|178.99|(-54.69%)| |[MSTZ](|2x Inverse ETF|Short|19.06|13.02|(-31.69%)| |[SMST](|2x Inverse ETF|Short|113.00|71.24|(-36.96%)| |[MSTR260116P00300000](|Jan 2026 300p|Short|104.02|121.27|\\+16.58%| |[MSTR260116P00250000\\*](|Jan 2026 250p|Short|74.30|72.81|(-2.01%)| |[MSTR260116P00200000](|Jan 2026 200p|Short|49.65|30.71|(-38.15%)| |[MSTR270115P00300000](|Jan 2027 300p|Short|132.00|144.05|\\+9.13%| |[MSTR270115P00250000\\*](|Jan 2027 250p|Short|98.80|100.00|\\+1.21%| |[MSTR270115P00200000\\*](|Jan 2027 200p|Short|69.09|67.20|(-2.74%)| As you can see, I was **spectacularly right** that the price of MSTR would plummet. MSTR bagholders have had a miserable time (-55%). However, I would have also lost about 1/3 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST, as they naturally \"sell low\" and \"buy high\" (the basis of their volatility decay). Note that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options, the less initially OTM put options (300p) would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red. **\"Why don't you short it?\"** In the end, it pretty much never makes sense to short a stock, even one that is completely garbage. You get an average of 11% per year with much less risk just for indexing (which requires no conviction), >20% in recent years. If you really have the ability to generate alpha--as one must suppose to justify a short position--you can presumably get much higher than >20% annual returns.",

However I would have also lost about 13 of my principle with inverse ETFs MSTZ or SMST as they naturally sell low and buy high the basis of their volatility decay . Note that even though MSTR has fallen below the strike price for all the options the less initially OTM put options 300p would have been positive whereas the 200p would have been in the red . Why dont you short it In the end it pretty much never_makes sense to short a stock even one that is completely garbage . You get an average of 11 % per year with much less risk just for indexing which requires no_conviction 20 % in recent years . If you really have the ability to generate alphaas one must suppose to justify a short positionyou can presumably get much higher than 20 % annual returns ."

At its core, return stacking is the idea of layering one investment return on top of another to achieve more than $1.00 of exposure for every $1.00 invested. This is typically done to maintain core portfolio exposure (like stocks and bonds) while simultaneously introducing new, diversifying return streams (like managed futures or other alternative strategies).",

      "selftext": "I’m trying to understand why the market caught me by surprise today regarding my trade. I’ve only been trading since late March this year and I’m not consistently profitable yet. My strategy is basically options trading and determining the support and resistance levels for tickers. Robinhood has been the ticker I’ve been going in and out of since I started this strategy back in September. Anyways on DEC 3rd I bought a few contracts of HOOD 137 call EXP 12/12. Robinhood has been very reactive on rate cut probabilities. With the PCE data coming out today and high probability that the number would come in lower than expected I thought it would be a safe call to hold until Friday and see if the stock climbs higher. It did the opposite of that and before any data was even released. As it dipped this morning my decision was to hold until after the release of the PCE. My assumption was that the Market was reacting out of fear not data. It climbed a little after the PCE was released but eventually settled to 131.80. I was right about the data but was wrong about the Markets reaction.",

I ’ ve only been trading since late March this year and I ’ m not_consistently profitable yet . My strategy is basically options trading and determining the support and resistance levels for tickers . Robinhood has been the ticker I ’ ve been going in and out of since I started this strategy back in September . Anyways on DEC 3rd I bought a few contracts of HOOD 137 call EXP 1212 . Robinhood has been very reactive on rate cut probabilities . With the PCE data coming out today and high probability that the number would come in lower than expected I thought it would be a safe call to hold until Friday and see if the stock climbs higher . It did the opposite of that and before any data was even released . As it dipped this morning my decision was to hold until after the release of the PCE . My assumption was that the Market was reacting out of fear not_data . It climbed a little after the PCE was released but eventually settled to 131.80 . I was right about the data but was wrong about the Markets reaction ."

      "selftext": "I used to think trading fees were just part of trading,like you pay them and move on. But lately I’ve been noticing how much they mess with my decisions. I lookout for larger profit margin before each trade A few days ago I tried a small experiment on Bitget 0 fee stock race. I did some trades using tokenized stocks (E.G. NVDA/AMZN tokenized stocks). I wasn’t doing it because I think it’s the future or anything. I just wanted to see how it is. And honestly it felt different in a way I didn’t expect. When there’s a cost on every move, I do this thing where I start negotiating with myself. I hesitate on entries, then I end up late. Or I hold a loser longer because I’m thinking “I already paid to get in” which is dumb but my brain does it anyway. Sometimes I even size bigger than I should, not because the setup is better, but because it feels like I have to “make it worth it.” With this test, I noticed my behavior calmed down. First, I stopped doing that internal debate. It was just, do I like the setup or not. Second, my sizing got more normal. I could scale in or cut without feeling like every adjustment was a tax. I didn’t feel forced into making fewer, bigger decisions. Third, I chased less. I thought removing friction would make me click more, but it was kind of the opposite. Because I could act anytime, I didn’t feel pressure to act right now. I’m not saying this makes anyone profitable or that fees are the root of all evil. But I do think “cost to act” is a real factor in trading psychology, and most people don’t track it. They track their entries and exits, but not the way friction pushes them into weird choices. Anyway I’m going to keep running this for the Phase 3 window as a personal test and see what it does to my stats. If the only thing that changed is friction and my results improve, that’s going to be a little uncomfortable to admit. Curious if anyone else noticed this when switching to lower fee setups, even just going from one broker to another. Did you end up trading more, or did you just trade smarter?",

      "selftext": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never touch it, even more specifically the S&P 500 as it has outperformed 90% of all individual stocks in about 85% of all hedge funds and 75% of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor. This is why the S&P 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes, period. While all of this may be true, there is something that still needs to be considered: When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007, it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing is wrong and just keep passively investing. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive, however, there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous. The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max, the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50% or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50% decline, The US dollar will devalue dramatically. In this current predicament, I would not say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging. If you were to buy in 2007 or pre- Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25-year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the S&P 500. And for the Great depression, it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even. So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 20-40 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years. This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on. According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader, it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not 9 months, but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds, not US bonds for reasons I can discuss later, as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession. So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions. After a substantial decline my goal is buy at -20%, then -35% then near -50% is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession. Please do not be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term. PS. My average annualized percent gain is 50%. Try getting that in an index fund",

So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions . After a substantial decline my goal is buy at 20 % then 35 % then near 50 % is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession . Please do not_be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term . PS . My average annualized percent gain is 50 % . Try getting that in an index fund"

It's not a small company by any means - and wouldn't benefit any less then companies like OPEN that got so much attention earlier. So is there some big thing that I am missing? In terms of risk/reward it seems like a safe play and the upside could be huge if the 50B revenue can actually be achieved in the future. URI and XPO has blown up before. I got 335 shares on a cost basis of around 18,7 - but am I stupid for thinking that this will probably be worth a couple of times more within the coming years?",

Short interest is extremely high 55 % borrow fees are expensive and institutional plus insider ownership lock up most of the float . This creates a tight share supply meaning buying pressure can move the stock quickly and force shorts to cover at higher prices . The company has major catalysts pending including large Puerto Rico contracts LNG agreements and progress with its Brazil and San Juan energy projects . Klondike data center power and Zero hydrogenclean energy provide long term growth optionality not_yet priced in . Analysts expect strong revenue growth improved profitability and price targets far above the current level . Hedge funds added long positions in Q3 signaling confidence in the company ’ s direction . Debt is the main risk but NFE is restructuring it selling non core assets and shifting toward asset level financing that reduces company wide exposure . Most debt is backed by operating revenue producing infrastructure giving it real asset support ."

      "selftext": "Man, I still can’t wrap my head around the fact that we’re like twenty something days away from 2026. This year just flew by and honestly, it was kinda wild in a good way. Hands down, my favorite move of the year was piling into NVDA back in March/April when the market vibe was super doom and gloom. Everyone was like, “chips are way too high, risky as hell,” and I was sitting there thinking, “Nah dude this is the moment,” so I slammed that buy button hard. And… you saw how that played out. AI popped off everywhere, and NVDA just took off like a freakin’ rocket Low key, the gains scared me for a minute. Probably the closest I’ve ever gotten to “holy shit profit” on a long-term play seriously. Of course balance in the universe I dumped LLY way too early. Thought it was overextended, figured a pullback was coming and then the damn thing just kept moon-walking upward. Every time I see news about it: “So I basically sold a money printer cool cool cool Anyway, I’m already cooking up my 2026 plans. Right now I’m thinking: • Still adding to tech, but way more picky this time • Pumping up my healthcare dividend positions • Maybe dipping into some international ETFs if the setup looks good Still brainstorming, but that’s the rough game plan. So tell me ： What was YOUR craziest win of 2025? Any trade that still haunts you like “bro if I could just redo that one move And for 2026 full send again? Or just stacking cash and staying chill? Drop your war stories I need some inspiration too, man!",

This year just flew by and honestly it was kinda wild in a good way . Hands down my favorite move of the year was piling into NVDA back in MarchApril when the market vibe was super doom and gloom . Everyone was like “ chips are way too high risky as hell ” and I was sitting there thinking “ Nah dude this is the moment ” so I slammed that buy button hard . And… you saw how that played out . AI popped off everywhere and NVDA just took off like a freakin ’ rocket Low key the gains scared me for a minute . Probably the closest I ’ ve ever gotten to “ holy shit profit ” on a longterm play seriously . Of course balance in the universe I dumped LLY way too early . Thought it was overextended figured a pullback was coming and then the damn thing just kept moonwalking upward . Every time I see news about it “ So I basically sold a money printer cool cool cool Anyway I ’ m already cooking up my 2026 plans . Right now I ’ m thinking • Still adding to tech but way more picky this time • Pumping up my healthcare dividend positions • Maybe dipping into some international ETFs if the setup looks good Still brainstorming but that ’ s the rough game plan . So tell me ： What was YOUR craziest win of 2025 Any trade that still haunts you like “ bro if I could just redo that one move And for 2026 full send again Or just stacking cash and staying chill Drop your war stories I need some inspiration too man"

I thought I'd be clever and sell in-the-money covered calls on them to at least capture some premium while I get rid of them. But does this somehow trigger a wash sale? (Assuming I do NOT buy them back for at least 31 days). I'm seeing conflicting information with online sources. I have 100 shares of ABC and I'm down $2,000. I can sell 1 contract on ABC for $250 to expire next week. Let the price hit. Be assigned and forced to sell. Which is what I want to do anyway. Thoughts?",

      "title": "Google - not AMD - is Nvidia’s greatest threat because of their full-stack AI and AlphaEvolve",
      "selftext": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)]( \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI. # Full-stack AI Now, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve). But what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product. But before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering? I’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis]( worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future. # AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms]( The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on. Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that. # All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”]( Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly. Nvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD. **Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. **TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.",

      "selftext_processed": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company ’ s conception . Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000 Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google . So we had the ultimate search engine it would understand everything on the web it would understand um you know exactly what you wanted and it would give you the right thing . And thats obviously artificial intelligence . Google CoFounder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI 2000 For those that don ’ t know it was supposedly Larry Page ’ s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI . Fullstack AI Now imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation . Your first thought will probably be Which should I pick ChatGPT immediately comes to mind but you want to do your research properly . Through your research you find that Googles Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck at least among American AI models . Plus they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model . Perfect . Google seems like a good choice . Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity especially if they improve . But what about implementation Google offers enterpriseready APIs via Vertex with more features coming like auth database and payments Google Cloud for storage and now even at location TPUs that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible . Super . Suddenly your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google and along the way you never_touch an Nvidia product . But before you make your final decision you ask yourself Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term so I don ’ t get vendorlocked with an inferior offering I ’ ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never_want to bet against the man and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way . I don ’ t imagine Nvidia is particularly or really at all threatened by Google in the short term though Googles TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices reducing profit margin . Apparently OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia . Though what is actually important is not_the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future . AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve A Geminipowered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms The evolutionary AI system had in secret improved everything from the training of their AI models to Googles hardware i.e . their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multibillion dollar deal for them with Meta considering the same . The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro not_even Gemini 2.5 . Today it ’ s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations and in the future it will use far more powerful models than that . Meaning that the better Google ’ s AI models get the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google ’ s models and hardware . The cheaper and better Google ’ s hardware the more powerful models can be built and run . The more powerful the models the better the hardware . And so on . Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia ’ s CUDA moat . One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA . But once AI models become sufficiently advanced the programming difficulty may not_be a concern or Google and Gemini create some CUDAvariant of their own . Rumors also exist of them doing just that . All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business it ’ s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia . If they do it often enough AI labs will eventually wonder can you build better AI models without Nvidia This will be especially true if other AIlabs do it too “ resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs ” Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for Not_at all as I said Ive spent enough time studying Jensen that Id never_want to bet against him . After all he is a man who roommated with a 17yearold excon covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5trilliondollar man . Jensen has a ton of cards to play and he ’ s already playing them perfectly . Nvidia still has a hardwarehardwaresoftware lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future . If they make a substantial compute leap Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia ’ s AI lab absorb one of the AI labs or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race . He is securing longterm deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia . Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development . He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem . Nvidia will likely begin to offer fullstack solutions of its own . And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia Google and AMD . Disclaimer I hold a significant long position in Google Alphabet . The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not_constitute financial or investment advice . Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions . TLDR Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin . But over the long term Google ’ s full stack offerings AI modelsapplications cloud and TPUs with AI model ’ s designed to improve AI models and hardware AlphaEvolve getting better Google might even take a long term lead . Though Jensen is playing Nvidia ’ s cards perfectly ."

      "selftext": "Today, Microsoft shareholders formally approved all company proposals, including board elections and the 2026 stock plan. But more notably shareholders rejected all six shareholder proposals, including one demanding Microsoft submit a “human rights due diligence report.” This raises several questions: Amid AI's sweeping expansion, Microsoft increasingly resembles a “state-owned enterprise among tech giants.” Yet shareholders have clearly granted the company greater autonomy this time. From a purely market perspective, this outcome is almost entirely positive for the stock price, as the company avoids being shackled by additional regulatory reporting requirements. Yet from a long-term ESG and social responsibility perspective, won't this become a latent concern for Microsoft? Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI, AI regulation, and data ethics. My personal take: This vote feels more like the market collectively saying, “Keep driving performance we don't want distractions.” But as AI operations expand, whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain. What are your thoughts? Is this a rational market choice, or is it merely deferring potential long-term risks? I'm particularly curious to hear others' perspectives on Microsoft's positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years.",

Yet from a longterm ESG and social responsibility perspective wont this become a latent concern for Microsoft Especially as tensions escalate around sensitive areas like OpenAI AI regulation and data ethics . My personal take This vote feels more like the market collectively saying “ Keep driving performance we dont want distractions. ” But as AI operations expand whether such proposals resurface remains uncertain . What are your thoughts Is this a rational market choice or is it merely deferring potential longterm risks Im particularly curious to hear others perspectives on Microsofts positioning under AI regulatory pressure over the next 1–3 years ."

      "title": "“Buying on dips” isn't as effective as imagined; over the long term, it may even be less effective than “buy and hold.”",
      "selftext": "The reason lies in the fact that buying on dips essentially involves counter trend trading during periods of market momentum that is, anticipating reversals while the trend persists, thereby imposing value investing principles onto momentum cycles. Historical data indicates that trends tend to continue rather than reverse immediately. Furthermore, when examining the correlation between buying on dips and the SG Trend Index, it was discovered that the SG Trend Index represents the average return of the top 10 hedge funds employing trend following strategies. The correlation coefficient is -0.14, a modest value, yet it maintains a negative correlation across all strategies. In contrast, trend following delivers genuine value during market declines. Analyzing four bear market periods, the “buy the dip” strategy averaged an 18% decline, while the S&P 500 averaged a 40% drop. Conversely, the trend strategy gained 29%. More intriguingly, testing 196 “buy the dip” strategies against the S&P 500 revealed: Risk adjusted returns (technically called the Sharpe ratio) were worse than passive holding across all strategies. I believe the core issue is that there's no endless stream of capital waiting to buy the dip, so you must sell at some point. This exit timing must be precise: too early, and the gains from buying the dip are largely offset by missed upside; too late, and you might miss the rally entirely. Therefore, bottom fishing is fundamentally suited for those with idle cash. Without it, one must resort to margin trading or even borrowing money to leverage stock investments, which carries enormous risk. In summary, for bottom fishing to succeed, the timing of stock purchases must be more opportune than usual, and cash reserves must be sufficient. Another challenge lies in defining the rules for testing bottom fishing strategies, such as duration and extent of decline.",

      "selftext_processed": "The reason lies in the fact that buying on dips essentially involves counter trend trading during periods of market momentum that is anticipating reversals while the trend persists thereby imposing value investing principles onto momentum cycles . Historical data indicates that trends tend to continue rather than reverse immediately . Furthermore when examining the correlation between buying on dips and the SG Trend Index it was discovered that the SG Trend Index represents the average return of the top 10 hedge funds employing trend following strategies . The correlation coefficient is 0.14 a modest value yet it maintains a negative correlation across all strategies . In contrast trend following delivers genuine value during market declines . Analyzing four bear market periods the “ buy the dip ” strategy averaged an 18 % decline while the SP 500 averaged a 40 % drop . Conversely the trend strategy gained 29 % . More intriguingly testing 196 “ buy the dip ” strategies against the SP 500 revealed Risk adjusted returns technically called the Sharpe ratio were worse than passive holding across all strategies . I believe the core issue is that theres no_endless stream of capital waiting to buy the dip so you must sell at some point . This exit timing must be precise too early and the gains from buying the dip are largely offset by missed upside too late and you might miss the rally entirely . Therefore bottom fishing is fundamentally suited for those with idle cash . Without it one must resort to margin trading or even borrowing money to leverage stock investments which carries enormous risk . In summary for bottom fishing to succeed the timing of stock purchases must be more opportune than usual and cash reserves must be sufficient . Another challenge lies in defining the rules for testing bottom fishing strategies such as duration and extent of decline ."

      "title": "Consumer confidence has shown a slight rebound, but sentiment remains cautious what does this really mean for the market outlook?",
      "selftext": "Today's data is a bit complex. The December Consumer Confidence Index edged up slightly to 53.3, which appears positive, but the increase actually falls within the margin of error. The real notable improvement lies in the expectations of younger demographics and personal financial outlooks, which rose by 13%. However, overall consumer sentiment remains cautious, with high inflation pressures frequently cited. Labor market expectations, though slightly better than in November, remain weak. What surprised me is: Short-term inflation expectations have fallen for four consecutive months, reaching 4.1% the lowest this year while long-term expectations also dropped to 3.2%. This part does offer the market some breathing room. But the issues are: The improvement in sentiment is modest. Consumer concerns about “personal finances over the next year” are even more pessimistic than at the start of the year. Labor market expectations continue to hover at low levels. This leaves me somewhat hesitant Does this combination of “mild recovery + persistent caution” truly count as positive news? My take is: Markets may interpret “declining inflation expectations” as a bullish signal, but consumer spending hasn't truly regained momentum. In this scenario, equities might adopt an “optimistic interpretation” in the short term, yet sustainability hinges on upcoming employment, wage, and inflation data in the coming weeks. What are your thoughts? Is this a “moderate positive” for the market, or does it still conceal downside risks?",

      "selftext_processed": "Todays data is a bit complex . The December Consumer Confidence Index edged up slightly to 53.3 which appears positive but the increase actually falls within the margin of error . The real notable improvement lies in the expectations of younger demographics and personal financial outlooks which rose by 13 % . However overall consumer sentiment remains cautious with high inflation pressures frequently cited . Labor market expectations though slightly better than in November remain weak . What surprised me is Shortterm inflation expectations have fallen for four consecutive months reaching 4.1 % the lowest this year while longterm expectations also dropped to 3.2 % . This part does offer the market some breathing room . But the issues are The improvement in sentiment is modest . Consumer concerns about “ personal finances over the next year ” are even more pessimistic than at the start of the year . Labor market expectations continue to hover at low levels . This leaves me somewhat hesitant Does this combination of “ mild recovery persistent caution ” truly count as positive news My take is Markets may interpret “ declining inflation expectations ” as a bullish signal but consumer spending hasnt truly regained momentum . In this scenario equities might adopt an “ optimistic interpretation ” in the short term yet sustainability hinges on upcoming employment wage and inflation data in the coming weeks . What are your thoughts Is this a “ moderate positive ” for the market or does it still conceal downside risks"

      "selftext": "Most people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong. They look at red charts, crushed valuations, and ugly sentiment and think: \"See, it was all hype. The tech doesn’t work. The economics don’t add up.\" No. The tech works. The physics work. The economics work. What doesn’t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity. # 1. Oil survives on scarcity. Clean energy survives on abundance. Oil is valuable because it is limited. You can control supply. You can restrict access. You can manipulate flows and influence pricing. That model has fed entire dynasties, countries, and corporate empires for decades. Clean energy is the opposite. You cannot corner the sun. You cannot own the wind. You cannot put a fence around photons. As you scale solar, wind, storage, and smarter grids, you move closer to something energy markets are not built to handle: practical abundance. When a resource moves toward abundance, long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage. That does not threaten the technology. It threatens the business model that ruled the last century. # 2. Old money versus new players This is not a morality play. It is a capital structure problem. Oil money has had decades to dig into governments, regulators, media, and financial systems. New clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale. They do not have the same lobbying power or political weight. So when you see pressure on clean energy stocks, it is not just \"the market is disappointed.\" It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory. Old money is not going to roll over because the physics improved. # 3. Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart People say: \"If this sector is the future, why do all these charts look like trash?\" Because the market is not just pricing tech. It is pricing resistance. The closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption, the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity. That resistance does not target one company. It hits the entire sector. So the charts move together. Mass rerates up when optimism spikes. Then mass punishment when pressure comes back in. Rinse, repeat. You are not just watching fundamentals. You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action. # 4. The transition is inevitable, but not painless Clean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason: it is better aligned with physics and long term economics. Once the upfront buildout is done, a lot of the \"fuel\" is free. Sunlight does not send an invoice. Wind does not negotiate shipping rates. But the speed of the transition is not decided only by engineers. It is decided by capital and policy. That is why you can see: * The technology already working at scale in many regions * The costs already competitive or better * Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment There is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled. # 5. What this means for investors If you look at clean energy names and only see “downtrend,” you are missing the bigger picture. Yes, the sector is volatile. Yes, many companies will fail. Yes, a lot of garbage got funded along the way. But at the structural level, you are dealing with a simple reality: * The old world is built on monetizing scarcity. * The new world is built on scaling abundance. The economic winner is obvious over decades. The path there will not be smooth, especially when trillions in old capital are on the line. This is not financial advice. It is a reminder that red charts do not automatically mean \"dead tech.\" Sometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Most people are reading the clean energy sector completely wrong . They look at red charts crushed valuations and ugly sentiment and think See it was all hype . The tech doesn ’ t work . The economics don ’ t add up . No_The tech works . The physics work . The economics work . What doesn ’ t work anymore is the old power structure built on scarcity . 1 . Oil survives on scarcity . Clean energy survives on abundance . Oil is valuable because it is limited . You can control supply . You can restrict access . You can manipulate flows and influence pricing . That model has fed entire dynasties countries and corporate empires for decades . Clean energy is the opposite . You can not corner the sun . You can not own the wind . You can not put a fence around photons . As you scale solar wind storage and smarter grids you move closer to something energy markets are not_built to handle practical abundance . When a resource moves toward abundance long term prices tend to trend down and control shifts away from those who used scarcity as leverage . That does not_threaten the technology . It threatens the business model that ruled the last century . 2 . Old money versus new players This is not_a morality play . It is a capital structure problem . Oil money has had decades to dig into governments regulators media and financial systems . New clean energy companies are still building basic profitability and scale . They do not_have the same lobbying power or political weight . So when you see pressure on clean energy stocks it is not_just the market is disappointed . It is also the inertia of old capital defending its territory . Old money is not_going to roll over because the physics improved . 3 . Why clean energy stocks all look the same on the chart People say If this sector is the future why do all these charts look like trash Because the market is not_just pricing tech . It is pricing resistance . The closer we move toward widespread clean energy adoption the more direct the threat to those who rely on controlled scarcity . That resistance does not_target one company . It hits the entire sector . So the charts move together . Mass rerates up when optimism spikes . Then mass punishment when pressure comes back in . Rinse repeat . You are not_just watching fundamentals . You are watching a power struggle reflected in price action . 4 . The transition is inevitable but not_painless Clean energy wins on the long timeline for one reason it is better aligned with physics and long term economics . Once the upfront buildout is done a lot of the fuel is free . Sunlight does not_send an invoice . Wind does not_negotiate shipping rates . But the speed of the transition is not_decided only by engineers . It is decided by capital and policy . That is why you can see The technology already working at scale in many regions The costs already competitive or better Yet the sector still trading like it is some failed experiment There is a fight over how fast the old model gets dismantled . 5 . What this means for investors If you look at clean energy names and only see “ downtrend ” you are missing the bigger picture . Yes the sector is volatile . Yes many companies will fail . Yes a lot of garbage got funded along the way . But at the structural level you are dealing with a simple reality The old world is built on monetizing scarcity . The new world is built on scaling abundance . The economic winner is obvious over decades . The path there will not_be smooth especially when trillions in old capital are on the line . This is not_financial advice . It is a reminder that red charts do not_automatically mean dead tech . Sometimes they mean the future is colliding with people who have every reason to delay it ."

      "selftext": "This is the most critical inflation data ahead of next week's Fed FOMC meeting. After a rapid rally in the three days leading up to Thanksgiving, the broader market has entered its seventh trading day of consolidation within a high-level flag pattern. SPY's upside test remains around $686, while the downside test continues to focus on $680 (as the upward sloping trend channel causes highs and lows to shift slightly higher over time). The broader market is largely flat, with minimal gains or losses in individual stocks. Netflix's $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. continues to drag its stock down, with a 4% decline extending its downward trend. Oracle (ORCL), which suffered heavy losses earlier, is set to report earnings next week. Its stock has rebounded consecutively and is up 2% in premarket trading. Rare earth and copper mining stocks also lead premarket gains. While the broader market shows minimal daily volatility recently, individual stocks trade actively with rapidly shifting themes. Second and third tier stocks tied to quantum computing, nuclear power, stablecoins, and AI which plunged over 60% last month have surged sharply in recent days to catch up. Tech heavyweights rotate leadership daily, with 1-2 stocks leading gains. Canadian bank stocks stand out as the market's most stable segment, with several accelerating upward and hitting new all time highs. Intraday focus remains on whether yesterday's leaders like TSLA, META, and ORCL can extend gains, and whether MSFT, AMZN, and AAPL can quickly reverse declines.",

      "selftext": "Hey! First post on WSB. Here's why I'm betting big on Rivian: **Customers Love The Product** Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian, currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade, or posts on any of the EV/Rivian forums or subreddits. The product has well-documented reliability issues and despite that is still #1 in EV customer satisfaction. According to Consumer Reports' November 2025 survey, 86% of Rivian owners would buy again. BMW comes in second at 77%. Tesla is third at 75% with complaints about build quality. **CEO Has The Right Stuff** If you're seriously considering investing in Rivian, I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview ([Here's one]( with John Collison, founder of Stripe). I've listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews, and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic, ambitious, and competent CEOs out there. He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009. His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows. Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPO'd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around. Lucid's leadership does not hold a candle to this guy. Go watch them yourself (Marc Winterhoff, Peter Rawlinson) and see the difference. **Solid Company Culture** I don't look at Glassdoor. Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on [Blind]( Before making an investment in a tech company, I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what it's like working there. For example, I don't want to see things like \"excellent work-life balance\" or \"nepotism\" because they suggest an unproductive environment. The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fast-paced, scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently. I like that. **The R2 Is A Game-Changer** At a much more accessible $45,000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S, production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VW-backed Georgia plant. This one makes or breaks the company, and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. They're also planning a smaller, cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026. **Autonomy & AI Day On Dec 11** Rivian will likely unveil hands-free driving features, an overview of their sensor stack, and future autonomous roadmap. Not yet comparable to Tesla, but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock. **Amazon Delivery Vehicles** Rivian built about 2.5% of Amazon's fleet (30,000 vehicles) with a projection of over 10% by 2030 as gas vans are phased out. Rivian currently accounts for about 80-90% of Amazon's EV fleet. Take a look around you. If you see a cute-looking Amazon van, on the side you'll notice it's \"powered by Rivian\". **Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW** With VW's financial backing, Rivian is developing a modular, vertically-integrated EV software stack. VW already plans to use it across its brands, giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream. Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win. **Major Institutional Backing** Amazon owns 13% and VW owns 12.3% of Rivian. A welcome vote of confidence, given how closely they work together. Vanguard (6%), BlackRock (4%), UBS (1.6%) and a whole host of other well-known institutional investors are in as well. **The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation** I'll admit it - I'm an astrologer. But you can't look at this chart and say something didn't change after the last earnings call. Popped from 12-18, consolidated at 14.5-15, and headed higher all within a month. Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity. This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 12-13 again \"like it always does.\" It has steadily been making higher lows (6 separate times since Apr 2024 - roughly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and just recently 14) and once it breaks out, all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher. **Some Personal Anecdotes** * An AI/ML PhD friend of mine currently working in the self-driving space claimed that Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) is a \"long-running failure\", bought Rivian stock because he \"likes the car and company\" and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle. * My scammer ex-girlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her. I didn't, but every time we'd drive around town and she saw one she'd point at it and excitedly say \"Rivian!\" in that cute little Russian accent of hers. I don't miss her all that much, she was a complete pain in the ass. Really, I don't.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey First post on WSB . Heres why Im betting big on Rivian Customers Love The Product Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade or posts on any of the EVRivian forums or subreddits . The product has welldocumented reliability issues and despite that is still 1 in EV customer satisfaction . According to Consumer Reports November 2025 survey 86 % of Rivian owners would buy again . BMW comes in second at 77 % . Tesla is third at 75 % with complaints about build quality . CEO Has The Right Stuff If youre seriously considering investing in Rivian I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview Heres one with John Collison founder of Stripe . Ive listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic ambitious and competent CEOs out there . He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009 . His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows . Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPOd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around . Lucids leadership does not_hold a candle to this guy . Go watch them yourself Marc Winterhoff Peter Rawlinson and see the difference . Solid Company Culture I dont look at Glassdoor . Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on Blind Before making an investment in a tech company I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what its like working there . For example I dont want to see things like excellent worklife balance or nepotism because they suggest an unproductive environment . The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fastpaced scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently . I like that . The R2 Is A GameChanger At a much more accessible $ 45000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VWbacked Georgia plant . This one makes or breaks the company and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive . Theyre also planning a smaller cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026 . Autonomy AI Day On Dec 11 Rivian will likely unveil handsfree driving features an overview of their sensor stack and future autonomous roadmap . Not_yet comparable to Tesla but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock . Amazon Delivery Vehicles Rivian built about 2.5 % of Amazons fleet 30000 vehicles with a projection of over 10 % by 2030 as gas vans are phased out . Rivian currently accounts for about 8090 % of Amazons EV fleet . Take a look around you . If you see a cutelooking Amazon van on the side youll notice its powered by Rivian . Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW With VWs financial backing Rivian is developing a modular verticallyintegrated EV software stack . VW already plans to use it across its brands giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream . Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win . Major Institutional Backing Amazon owns 13 % and VW owns 12.3 % of Rivian . A welcome vote of confidence given how closely they work together . Vanguard 6 % BlackRock 4 % UBS 1.6 % and a whole host of other wellknown institutional investors are in as well . The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation Ill admit it Im an astrologer . But you cant look at this chart and say something didnt change after the last earnings call . Popped from 1218 consolidated at 14.515 and headed higher all within a month . Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity . This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 1213 again like it always does . It has steadily been making higher lows 6 separate times since Apr 2024 roughly 8 9 10 11 12 and just recently 14 and once it breaks out all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher . Some Personal Anecdotes An AIML PhD friend of mine currently working in the selfdriving space claimed that Tesla FSD Full SelfDriving is a longrunning failure bought Rivian stock because he likes the car and company and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle . My scammer exgirlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her . I didnt but every time wed drive around town and she saw one shed point at it and excitedly say Rivian in that cute little Russian accent of hers . I dont miss her all that much she was a complete pain in the ass . Really I dont ."

      "selftext": "I (23) grew up in a poor household and have been (and still am) working various jobs and saving since the age of 15, investing the moment i turned 18. Throughout that period I have earned a total of $60k and another $60k was given to me due to an accident. My investment is currently sitting on $120k with a dividend yield of 6.4%. I have never spend a single cent for any entertainment purposes from dividends and all the money I had and still receiving from my internship and side job, which are being split 80/20. 80% for investment, 20% on needs (bills and necessities). But for 2026 I really feel like just taking a break and relax from all the things that I have been doing (DRIPS + salary contribution + tracking finances) and really enjoy the fruits of my efforts. But tbh, I do not know how to go about doing that because Ive never done it in my life like going overseas and stuff. Those who have faced the same or similar issue as me, what did you do to really just relax your mind about all these things.",

      "selftext": "As we all know, 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again, with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains. Personally, as far as an AI bubble is concerned, the market still has legs to run -- and empirical as this is, I don't think we'll have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind. Here's my current portfolio weights, how I'll be reallocating for the new year, and my predictions on how each will move! I'll be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year :) NVDA - 17% Nvidia continues to be my largest holding. There is significant overlap with my ETFs, but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which I'm comfortable having overweight. Doubt we will see 30+% gains after such a huge run-up though, although a 20% gain wouldn't surprise me. QQQ - 16% I've unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didn't realise there were alternatives (QQQM) with much lower expense ratios. Anyway, doesn't make sense for me to sell and buy back, but just a note for beginners. Mag 7 propelled it to 20+% gains this year, I'm predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12% gain in 2026, supported by more mid caps. VOO - 15% Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech. Predicting a healthy 9% as tech continues to outpace other sectors. AAPL - 11% The Vision Pro hasn't seen much success yet, and I think it's very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point. However, with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year, I think it'll continue to see revenue growth. Predicting a 16% upside. META - 9% Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut, hope to see more of that in the coming year. While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT. As far as I'm concerned, the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage. Share price has been relatively shaky this year, but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18%. VT - 7% Going to continue DCAing into VT, likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year. Non-US markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I don't have enough conviction to go into VXUS. Assuming global markets do better than the US, I'm projecting 11% upside. XLU - 6% My only defensive holding in utilities. Being capital-intensive, utilities should benefit greatly from a low-rate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk. Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well. Don’t expect big gains, at most 8%, just on pace with the overall market. DUOL - 5% One of my only two high-risk plays. Down from highs over 540 this year, share price has begun to consolidate. The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising long-term user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market, but this is a good long-term outlook. With a 34% 3-5 year projected EPS growth rate, I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32% gain. ANET - 3% Last but not least, my smallest holding (for now). My long-term AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have. Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns, but with the prospect of a continue, albeit slowing bull market, I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth. My guess is 35%, and I will be adding ANET/VRT on dips close to their 50MA. Let me know what you guys think about my predictions!",

      "selftext_processed": "As we all know 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains . Personally as far as an AI bubble is concerned the market still has legs to run and empirical as this is I dont think well have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind . Heres my current portfolio weights how Ill be reallocating for the new year and my predictions on how each will move Ill be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year NVDA 17 % Nvidia continues to be my largest holding . There is significant overlap with my ETFs but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which Im comfortable having overweight . Doubt we will see 30 % gains after such a huge runup though although a 20 % gain wouldnt surprise me . QQQ 16 % Ive unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didnt realise there were alternatives QQQM with much lower expense ratios . Anyway doesnt make sense for me to sell and buy back but just a note for beginners . Mag 7 propelled it to 20 % gains this year Im predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12 % gain in 2026 supported by more mid caps . VOO 15 % Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech . Predicting a healthy 9 % as tech continues to outpace other sectors . AAPL 11 % The Vision Pro hasnt seen much success yet and I think its very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point . However with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year I think itll continue to see revenue growth . Predicting a 16 % upside . META 9 % Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut hope to see more of that in the coming year . While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now I dont think itll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT . As far as Im concerned the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage . Share price has been relatively shaky this year but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18 % . VT 7 % Going to continue DCAing into VT likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year . NonUS markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I dont have enough conviction to go into VXUS . Assuming global markets do better than the US Im projecting 11 % upside . XLU 6 % My only defensive holding in utilities . Being capitalintensive utilities should benefit greatly from a lowrate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk . Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well . Don ’ t expect big gains at most 8 % just on pace with the overall market . DUOL 5 % One of my only two highrisk plays . Down from highs over 540 this year share price has begun to consolidate . The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising longterm user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market but this is a good longterm outlook . With a 34 % 35 year projected EPS growth rate I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32 % gain . ANET 3 % Last but not_least my smallest holding for now . My longterm AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have . Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns but with the prospect of a continue albeit slowing bull market I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth . My guess is 35 % and I will be adding ANETVRT on dips close to their 50MA . Let me know what you guys think about my predictions"

The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.” Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion. The breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.",

Discovery, bringing a swift end to a dramatic bidding process that saw Paramount Skydance and Comcast also vying for the legacy assets. The deal is comprised of cash and stock and is valued at $27.75 per WBD share, the companies said. That puts the total enterprise value of the transaction at approximately $82.7 billion. The deal is for WBD’s film studio and streaming service, HBO Max. Warner Bros. Discovery will still spin out its TV networks, which includes TNT and CNN, as previously planned. The acquisition is expected to close after that separation takes place, now expected in the third quarter of 2026. Source:",

The company, best known as Apple’s main iPhone assembler, also highlighted continued momentum in AI-related hardware.A big part of the growth seems to be coming from AI server racks the same systems powering data centers as companies scale up their infrastructure for model training and deployment. Foxconn has been leaning more heavily into that segment, and the numbers suggest it’s starting to show up meaningfully in results.For now, demand for AI hardware remains one of the steadier drivers in an otherwise mixed electronics market, and Foxconn looks like it’s benefiting directly from that shift.

The company best known as Apple ’ s main iPhone assembler also highlighted continued momentum in AIrelated hardware.A big part of the growth seems to be coming from AI server racks the same systems powering data centers as companies scale up their infrastructure for model training and deployment . Foxconn has been leaning more heavily into that segment and the numbers suggest it ’ s starting to show up meaningfully in results.For now demand for AI hardware remains one of the steadier drivers in an otherwise mixed electronics market and Foxconn looks like it ’ s benefiting directly from that shift .

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.

      "selftext": "Moore Threads had a massive first day in Shanghai, jumping more than 400% after its $1.1 billion IPO. It’s one of the biggest debuts for a Chinese chip company this year and comes at a time when Beijing is pushing hard to build a domestic GPU ecosystem. The timing matters. With U.S. sanctions limiting China’s access to advanced manufacturing, companies like Moore Threads, Huawei, and Cambricon are all stepping in to fill the gap. China clearly wants local alternatives that can support AI, gaming, and data-center workloads without depending on U.S. suppliers. Moore Threads still has a long way to go in matching the performance of global leaders, but the market’s reaction shows how much enthusiasm there is behind China’s semiconductor push. The broader chip sector in China has been accelerating, with new entrants and established players all competing for the same growing demand. Curious what everyone thinks is this early hype or a sign that China’s GPU ecosystem is finally gaining real momentum? Source: [",

I hadn't really put a finger on the possible value of the write-down, but I know it would be large. However, now we know. Warner Brothers Dscovery has taken a $9 billion write-down of its TV assets. On many levels this doesn't bode well for the company. WBD still has about $43 billion dollars in combined long-term and short-term debt on its balance sheet and still tens of billions of dollars in intangible assets. However, the good thing is that the company has been generating relatively decent free cash flow. So, again, that's a good thing. The companies wanting to buy this company would do well to really knuckle down on doing it's due diligence. At this point, I give the stock a rating of HOLD.",

I hadnt really put a finger on the possible value of the writedown but I know it would be large . However now we know . Warner Brothers Dscovery has taken a $ 9 billion writedown of its TV assets . On many levels this doesnt bode well for the company . WBD still has about $ 43 billion dollars in combined longterm and shortterm debt on its balance sheet and still tens of billions of dollars in intangible assets . However the good thing is that the company has been generating relatively decent free cash flow . So again thats a good thing . The companies wanting to buy this company would do well to really knuckle down on doing its due diligence . At this point I give the stock a rating of HOLD ."

      "selftext": "Morgan Stanley, one of the key players in financing the artificial-intelligence race, is considering offloading some of its data-center exposure via a so-called significant risk transfer. The bank has held preliminary talks with potential investors about an SRT tied to a portfolio of loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. SRTs backed by data-center exposure are still a nascent slice of the credit-risk transfer market, where banks hedge their credit exposure, manage capital ratios and free up balance-sheet capacity for more lending by selling credit-linked notes to institutional investors. Morgan Stanley is also exploring other ways to hedge or syndicate part of its data-center risk, the people said, and there is no guarantee the early-stage SRT talks will result in a deal. Morgan Stanley in October arranged over $27 billion of debt and about $2.5 billion of equity financing for a special-purpose vehicle tied to the development of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Hyperion data-center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The bank also led three recent junk-bond offerings from TeraWulf Inc., Cipher Mining Inc., and Applied Digital Corp. in which the proceeds were earmarked in part to help finance the construction of new data-center facilities. Morgan Stanley strategists forecast big cloud computing companies will spend about $3 trillion on data-center infrastructure projects through 2028. Cash flow can fund only about half of that, the bank estimates, with most of the rest raised via debt markets. The lending surge may leave banks overexposed to a small group of companies.

They’re gpu hosting product seems maybe ok, but nothing special… also it’s not all obvious that companies are going to continue to need crazy gpu. Even if they do, it’s relatively small portion of google and they have no real competitive edge here over aws/microsoft. It feels like a classic case where they look good on paper (for now). But looking at the ecosystem we’re in (with a slightly technical eye) and it seems like they are totally screwed. I just needed outlet for this thought, bc as a policy I don’t short… Am I’m crazy?",

For some reason I have this fear about triggering conversions of realized losses into wash sale losses even if they’re outside of the 60-day window. In the following scenario, how much would my wash sale amount be? 1 March: I sell my entire position (100 shares) for a $100 realized loss; 1 April: I re-buy 100 shares of the stock (30 days’ past so no wash sale); 15 April: I sell 50 of the 100 shares of the stock for a $50 loss. I know the 15 April $50 loss would count as a wash sale against the remaining 50 shares purchased on 1 April, but would the 1 March $100 losses stay as realized losses or would they also be converted to wash sale losses?",

For some reason I have this fear about triggering conversions of realized losses into wash sale losses even if they ’ re outside of the 60day window . In the following scenario how much would my wash sale amount be 1 March I sell my entire position 100 shares for a $ 100 realized loss 1 April I rebuy 100 shares of the stock 30 days ’ past so no_wash sale 15 April I sell 50 of the 100 shares of the stock for a $ 50 loss . I know the 15 April $ 50 loss would count as a wash sale against the remaining 50 shares purchased on 1 April but would the 1 March $ 100 losses stay as realized losses or would they also be converted to wash sale losses"

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries . MY POSITION 200 Contracts of the $ 10 Strike Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $ 3.5 in premiums for a total of $ 71712 TLDR ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdownbig potential catalyst . Education is huge in China households spend 17 % of income on it 5x global avg . Reopening the sector helps job creation consumption and talent development . ﻿﻿If rules loosen TAL EDU become a nearduopoly due to heavy compliance barriers ﻿﻿Stock has been rangebound $ 8 $ 11 but sentiment policy tone in China is improving . Im in Jan 2027 $ 10 calls 200 contracts $ 72K as a longterm bet ."

      "title": "Japan's interest rate hike may trigger a major shock to global markets, signaling the end of the era of low interest rates!",
      "selftext": "Everyone's been focused on the Federal Reserve's actions lately, but what could truly ignite global markets this month isn't Washington, but Tokyo. This country, dormant for over 20 years, is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows. Over the past week, Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends, with the 30-year rate hitting a record high, the 10-year rate breaking a 17-year high, and even the 20-year rate reaching multi-year highs. For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates, this is no longer just market volatility, but a complete interest rate restart. More importantly, Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time, directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting. This sudden change has triggered high market tension, because last August, when Japan only slightly raised interest rates, global markets overreacted instantly, experiencing massive asset sell-offs. At that time, US stocks plummeted, Bitcoin was severely impacted, and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars. This time, it seems Japan is truly preparing to \"walk,\" and may even start \"running.\" How much impact will this have on global capital flows? For the past 30 years, the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation. However, since 2023, core CPI has been rising steadily, wage growth has exceeded 3%, and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991. This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases. But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery, if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates, the yen will continue to depreciate significantly, severely impacting Japan's import costs and corporate profits. Therefore, Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hard-won economic structure. The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the market's reaction. This strategy itself is a financial stress test; the market is no longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates, but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows. The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on low-interest-rate funds from Japan. Now, if Japan raises interest rates, this capital chain will begin to reverse, and global assets will face the risk of repricing. Why would this trigger a stampede? Because in the past, global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade, using low-interest-rate funds to invest in higher-yield assets (such as US stocks, US bonds, and Bitcoin). If the yen appreciates, these funds will have to be withdrawn, potentially triggering a massive asset sell-off. When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly, global financial market volatility will be even more severe. Last August's interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen, but it already triggered a sharp market reaction. This time, the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow, particularly from US and tech stocks, as well as high-risk assets globally. Whenever Japan raises interest rates, global investment portfolios will face reassessment, especially those high-risk assets reliant on low-cost funding. As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer, global markets are already preparing for a possible \"unwinding wave.\" Markets are becoming increasingly nervous, and investors are beginning to withdraw from high-risk assets, particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin. In the coming months, global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike, far exceeding the impact of fundamentals. Therefore, what truly needs attention now is not whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyones been focused on the Federal Reserves actions lately but what could truly ignite global markets this month isnt Washington but Tokyo . This country dormant for over 20 years is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows . Over the past week Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends with the 30year rate hitting a record high the 10year rate breaking a 17year high and even the 20year rate reaching multiyear highs . For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates this is no_longer just market volatility but a complete interest rate restart . More importantly Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting . This sudden change has triggered high market tension because last August when Japan only slightly raised interest rates global markets overreacted instantly experiencing massive asset selloffs . At that time US stocks plummeted Bitcoin was severely impacted and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars . This time it seems Japan is truly preparing to walk and may even start running . How much impact will this have on global capital flows For the past 30 years the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation . However since 2023 core CPI has been rising steadily wage growth has exceeded 3 % and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991 . This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases . But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates the yen will continue to depreciate significantly severely impacting Japans import costs and corporate profits . Therefore Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hardwon economic structure . The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the markets reaction . This strategy itself is a financial stress test the market is no_longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows . The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on lowinterestrate funds from Japan . Now if Japan raises interest rates this capital chain will begin to reverse and global assets will face the risk of repricing . Why would this trigger a stampede Because in the past global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade using lowinterestrate funds to invest in higheryield assets such as US stocks US bonds and Bitcoin . If the yen appreciates these funds will have to be withdrawn potentially triggering a massive asset selloff . When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly global financial market volatility will be even more severe . Last Augusts interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen but it already triggered a sharp market reaction . This time the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow particularly from US and tech stocks as well as highrisk assets globally . Whenever Japan raises interest rates global investment portfolios will face reassessment especially those highrisk assets reliant on lowcost funding . As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer global markets are already preparing for a possible unwinding wave . Markets are becoming increasingly nervous and investors are beginning to withdraw from highrisk assets particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin . In the coming months global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike far exceeding the impact of fundamentals . Therefore what truly needs attention now is not_whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike ."

      "selftext": "Apple’s general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, will retire from Apple, the company announced on Thursday. Apple said that Jennifer Newstead would become Apple’s new general counsel in March next year and that Jackson’s government affairs staff would report to her. The two executives previously reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook and represent the latest sign that Apple’s senior leadership is seeing a slew of exits. In recent weeks, Apple’s head software designer said he was leaving to go to Meta, Apple said that its AI chief was retiring, and Apple’s chief operating officer retired. Adams joined Apple and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company’s privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store’s restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company’s diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Prior to joining Apple in 2013, she spent four years as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. In that role, Jackson “focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,” according to her bio on Apple’s website. Jackson was instrumental in Apple’s launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company’s equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report on the initiative in 2023. “At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,” Jackson wrote in a section of that report. “We won’t delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.” Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Source: [",

Apple said that Jennifer Newstead would become Apple ’ s new general counsel in March next year and that Jackson ’ s government affairs staff would report to her . The two executives previously reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook and represent the latest sign that Apple ’ s senior leadership is seeing a slew of exits . In recent weeks Apple ’ s head software designer said he was leaving to go to Meta Apple said that its AI chief was retiring and Apple ’ s chief operating officer retired . Adams joined Apple and became general counsel in 2017 and oversaw legal matters including litigation global security and the company ’ s privacy initiatives . Under Adams Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store ’ s restrictions and fees . Jackson joined Apple in 2013 and led the company ’ s diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington D.C . Prior to joining Apple in 2013 she spent four years as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama . In that role Jackson “ focused on reducing greenhouse gases protecting air and water quality preventing exposure to toxic contamination and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues ” according to her bio on Apple ’ s website . Jackson was instrumental in Apple ’ s launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd . She then helped expand the company ’ s equity and justice efforts to other countries including the U.K. Mexico and New Zealand according to a report on the initiative in 2023 . “ At Apple we pledge that our resolve will not_fade ” Jackson wrote in a section of that report . “ We won ’ t delay action . We will work each and every day on the urgent task of advancing equity. ” Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington including state dinners . Source"

      "selftext": "MoonLake ($MLTX) is soaring today, and I believe we are just getting started. This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now, and a run-up to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th. Thesis (TL;DR): MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90%—because the market hyper-focused on a single narrowly missed endpoint, not the whole data set. Under the surface, sonelokimab (SLK) hit consistent, significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases, with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks. This is one of those rare moments where “disaster” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity. Data & Why the Panic Is Overdone: • VELA-1: Big win. Mid-30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo, all core secondaries positive. • VELA-2: Drug effect consistent with VELA-1, but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread (p ≈ .05). All secondary endpoints still positive; combined analysis is strongly significant (p < 0.001). []( [SLK HS VELA Trial Data]( • Takeaway: High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials. Look at the totality: consistent drug effect, positive secondaries, and durable benefit, not “dead drug.” More Than HS: Platform Upside (4 Indications):SLK is not a one-trick pony. MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications, including: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): Adult and adolescent, with long-term extension data. • Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP): LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive, immediate pipeline upgrade. • Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA): S-OLARIS readout Q1 2026. • Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): IZAR Phase 3, 2026. Upcoming Catalysts (Why Act Now): • Dec 15, 2025: FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application. A “yes” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher, while a “not without additional data” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90% one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year. • Q4 2025: LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform, not just HS. • Q1–Q2 2026: S-OLARIS (axSpA), VELA-TEEN/long-term HS, IZAR (PsA). You basically have a week or two to get a thesis-confirming or thesis-breaking regulatory answer—at panic-level valuations. Balance Sheet: MoonLake isn’t hurting for cash. They have hundreds of millions on hand, a fresh $75M raise, with extended runway into 2027. You’re not waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst; you’re waiting for data, and more data is coming imminently. Lawsuit/FUD Section (for the Record):Yes, the numerous class actions headlines exist: they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed, if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response. In biotech, legal and headline risk is always present post-drop, but those lawsuits don’t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon. The lawsuits are noise; the SLK’s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal. Risks: • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn. • LEDA readout/other pipeline indications could go nowhere and this is still a one-asset, high-volatility biotech—but I like the data so far. Asymmetric Setup: Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what’s not priced in is a credible FDA greenlight, positive PPP data, and the multi-indication platform angle. The next two catalysts (FDA and LEDA) will likely decide if this rerates violently higher, in the very near term. This window, with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits, could close fast. Part of the reason I'm so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock, which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline \"miss\". The data is there - SLK works, the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesn't work. But the data says it does, and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not just HS, but also PPP, PsA, axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesn't work. I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher, and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one. [I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—I'm posting this one.]( Disclosure: I (obviously) own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options, my kids even own MLTX. **I like the stock.** I don't know your personal financial situation, this is not financial advice.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake $ MLTX is soaring today and I believe we are just getting started . This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now and a runup to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th . Thesis TLDR MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90 % —because the market hyperfocused on a single narrowly missed endpoint not_the whole data set . Under the surface sonelokimab SLK hit consistent significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks . This is one of those rare moments where “ disaster ” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity . Data Why the Panic Is Overdone • VELA1 Big win . Mid30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo all core secondaries positive . • VELA2 Drug effect consistent with VELA1 but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread p ≈ .05 . All secondary endpoints still positive combined analysis is strongly significant p 0.001 . SLK HS VELA Trial Data • Takeaway High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials . Look at the totality consistent drug effect positive secondaries and durable benefit not_ “ dead drug. ” More Than HS Platform Upside 4 IndicationsSLK is not_a onetrick pony . MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications including • Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Adult and adolescent with longterm extension data . • Palmoplantar Pustulosis PPP LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive immediate pipeline upgrade . • Axial Spondyloarthritis axSpA SOLARIS readout Q1 2026 . • Psoriatic Arthritis PsA IZAR Phase 3 2026 . Upcoming Catalysts Why Act Now • Dec 15 2025 FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application . A “ yes ” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher while a “ not without additional data ” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90 % one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year . • Q4 2025 LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform not_just HS . • Q1–Q2 2026 SOLARIS axSpA VELATEENlongterm HS IZAR PsA . You basically have a week or two to get a thesisconfirming or thesisbreaking regulatory answer—at paniclevel valuations . Balance Sheet MoonLake isn ’ t hurting for cash . They have hundreds of millions on hand a fresh $ 75M raise with extended runway into 2027 . You ’ re not_waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst you ’ re waiting for data and more data is coming imminently . LawsuitFUD Section for the RecordYes the numerous class actions headlines exist they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response . In biotech legal and headline risk is always present postdrop but those lawsuits don ’ t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon . The lawsuits are noise the SLK ’ s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal . Risks • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn . • LEDA readoutother pipeline indications could go nowhere_and this is still a oneasset highvolatility biotech—but I like the data so far . Asymmetric Setup Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what ’ s not_priced in is a credible FDA greenlight positive PPP data and the multiindication platform angle . The next two catalysts FDA and LEDA will likely decide if this rerates violently higher in the very near term . This window with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits could close fast . Part of the reason Im so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline miss . The data is there SLK works the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesnt work . But the data says it does and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not_just HS but also PPP PsA axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesnt work . I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one . I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—Im posting this one . Disclosure I obviously own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options my kids even own MLTX . I like the stock . I dont know your personal financial situation this is not_financial advice . Do your own research ."

      "title": "[DD] WIX: The Market Says \"Dead Legacy Tech.\" The Math Says \"Rule of 40\" Cash Cow (9x EV/FCF).",
      "selftext": "I've been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive, and I kept ignoring **Wix (WIX)**. Like most of you, I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify. But I finally dug into their 10-Ks and updated guidance for 2025, and honestly, the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment. It looks like a classic capital return play that's being priced like a distressed asset. I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if I'm missing something obvious. Here is the raw math I’m looking at: 1. They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise. I thought they were unprofitable. Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and it's showing up in the GAAP numbers. Check out the Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin ramp: * **2022:** 2% (Barely broke even at $32M) * **2023:** 16% ($246M) * **2024:** 28% ($488M) * **2025 (Est):** 30%+ (On track for \\~$600M) Basically, they hit the \"Rule of 40\" way faster than anyone expected, but the stock price hasn't really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow. 2. The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30% margins, they usually trade at a premium. WIX is in the basement. * **WIX is trading at \\~9.0x EV/FCF.** * **The median for their peer group is around 14.2x.** * **The \"Quality\" names trade at 15-25x.** Even if you don't think WIX is a \"premium\" asset, a 40% discount to the *median* seems excessive for a company printing $600M a year in cash. 3. The \"AI Risk\" might be backwards The bear case is always \"AI will make website builders obsolete.\" I looked into this, and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now. Two things stood out in the segments: 1. **Partners (Agencies):** This isn't DIY revenue. This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients. It grew at a **30% CAGR** and hit **$610M** in 2024. This revenue is way stickier than the churn-heavy DIY stuff. 2. **Base44:** They bought/launched this AI app builder recently. It went from **300k users in June '25 to 2 Million in October**. I haven't modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe, but it gives them a foot in the door of the $25B low-code market. Valuation / Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins (low 30s) and keep growing revenue at a boring 15%. My model spits out an intrinsic value of around **$170**. Even if I'm wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow, the stock should be significantly higher than $96. **Where could I be wrong? (Bear Case)** I'm trying to kill this trade before I size up. * Obviously, Shopify is the elephant in the room. WIX seems to be winning on \"services\" websites vs. pure e-commerce, but the overlap is scary. * Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026? If the macro turns, their churn could look ugly fast. Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently? Am I overestimating the stickiness there? **Disclosure:** Long WIX. **Reference:** I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive and I kept ignoring Wix WIX . Like most of you I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify . But I finally dug into their 10Ks and updated guidance for 2025 and honestly the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment . It looks like a classic capital return play thats being priced like a distressed asset . I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if Im missing something obvious . Here is the raw math I ’ m looking at 1 . They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise . I thought they were unprofitable . Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and its showing up in the GAAP numbers . Check out the Free Cash Flow FCF margin ramp 2022 2 % Barely broke even at $ 32M 2023 16 % $ 246M 2024 28 % $ 488M 2025 Est 30 % On track for $ 600M Basically they hit the Rule of 40 way faster than anyone expected but the stock price hasnt really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow . 2 . The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30 % margins they usually trade at a premium . WIX is in the basement . WIX is trading at 9.0x EVFCF . The median for their peer group is around 14.2x . The Quality names trade at 1525x . Even if you dont think WIX is a premium asset a 40 % discount to the median seems excessive for a company printing $ 600M a year in cash . 3 . The AI Risk might be backwards The bear case is always AI will make website builders obsolete . I looked into this and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now . Two things stood out in the segments 1 . Partners Agencies This isnt DIY revenue . This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients . It grew at a 30 % CAGR and hit $ 610M in 2024 . This revenue is way stickier than the churnheavy DIY stuff . 2 . Base44 They boughtlaunched this AI app builder recently . It went from 300k users in June 25 to 2 Million in October . I havent modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe but it gives them a foot in the door of the $ 25B lowcode market . Valuation Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins low 30s and keep growing revenue at a boring 15 % . My model spits out an intrinsic value of around $ 170 . Even if Im wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow the stock should be significantly higher than $ 96 . Where could I be wrong Bear Case Im trying to kill this trade before I size up . Obviously Shopify is the elephant in the room . WIX seems to be winning on services websites vs. pure ecommerce but the overlap is scary . Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026 If the macro turns their churn could look ugly fast . Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently Am I overestimating the stickiness there Disclosure Long WIX . Reference I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog"

Because I've watched too many people ride winners back to zero waiting for \"just a bit more.\" The greed is real and it kills portfolios. That said - I break this rule for stuff I'm actually long on. Real estate that's throwing off cash? Not selling. Solana I'm staking? Staying put. Quality dividend plays? Those compound forever. But random defi yields, momentum stocks, anything that smells like hype? 70% and gone. No second thoughts. Basically: exit the bets, hold the investments.

Take a look at r/HealthInsurance and you will see people talking about how premiums are tripling or even worse just for bad insurance. Do you think the current admin will step in and fund these companies, driving the costs down for consumers. Or, will it not, and people will not have insurance. If the government steps in, then you could make a lot of money by going long on healthcare stocks. If not, healthy people will go without insurance, driving the prices for the elderly/sick higher. Further it could cause small business owners to close shop and find a job that contributes to their insurance. This could affect a large portion of the market by funneling more money into bigger companies. Let me know what you think.",

      "selftext": "Amazon is considering terminating its long-term contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to instead establish its own nationwide competitive delivery network. The existing agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two parties have spent months negotiating the next version of the contract, but talks have become complicated due to President Trump's push to privatize the USPS. Under the current deal, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency's projected 2025 revenue. This agreement plays a crucial role in the USPS's financial model. However, Amazon already operates an extensive transportation network, including aircraft, Rivian electric vans, and an emerging drone delivery service though the drone project has faced multiple challenges this year, including a recent investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. It is also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox, further strengthening its control over last mile delivery. Should Amazon decide to terminate its partnership with the USPS, it could have significant implications for the logistics industry. As Amazon bolsters its logistics network, will companies like Rivian and Zoox see further growth opportunities?",

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve's growing pressure for further rate cuts is gradually brightening the outlook for emerging market assets next year. Fidelity International stated: “If 2025 is a strong year for emerging markets, just wait for 2026.” This asset manager, overseeing over $1 trillion in assets, is joining a growing number of Wall Street banks betting that a weaker dollar will drive returns in developing-market assets next year. Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last year's rate hikes. While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year, substantial capital remains unallocated. This may lay the groundwork for 2026, where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations. Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets? After all, these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential. But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets' 2025 performance. Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 (according to MSCI indices). We know the dollar and euro often move inversely, and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness. In contrast, Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound. Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality, with many believing greater market opportunities exist here.",

Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last years rate hikes . While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year substantial capital remains unallocated . This may lay the groundwork for 2026 where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations . Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets After all these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential . But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets 2025 performance . Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 according to MSCI indices . We know the dollar and euro often move inversely and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley Bank of America and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness . In contrast Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound . Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality with many believing greater market opportunities exist here ."

The restructuring would likely include layoffs as Meta continues shifting resources away from its earlier metaverse ambitions and into AI, efficiency, and core products. The pivot isn’t surprising. Meta rebranded back in 2021 to bet big on the metaverse, but investor enthusiasm cooled fast as the unit racked up heavy losses. With AI now dominating Big Tech strategy (and Meta’s own AI efforts gaining traction), it looks like the company is tightening spending where returns have been the weakest. If these cuts go through, it would mark one of the clearest signs yet that Meta is prioritizing near-term profitability and AI capability over its longer-term virtual world vision. Anyone else think this is Meta admitting the metaverse bet just isn’t paying off or is this just a natural rebalancing of resources? Source: [",

The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities. >The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound ⁠in Hawaii last month, Bloomberg reported. >Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January, according to the report. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment. >\"Smart move, just late,\" said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber. \"This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought ​years ago.\" >The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality ‌headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. >Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community. >However, it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses, as competitors such as Alphabet's Google, [Apple]( and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts. >The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. >To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year. Overall, large tech companies are expected to spend around $400 billion on AI this year. >The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with million-dollar pay packages.",

      "selftext_processed": "Np paywall Meta is expected to make budget cuts of up to 30 % for its metaverse initiative Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people ​familiar with the discussions . The Facebook parents shares rose 4 % as the move eased ‌some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars only for the ‌business to burn more than $ 60 billion since 2020 . The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities . The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the companys annual budget planning for 2026 which included a series of meetings at Zuckerbergs compound ⁠in Hawaii last month Bloomberg reported . Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January according to the report . Meta did not_immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment . Smart move just late said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber . This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not_as prosperous as management thought ​years ago . The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs which produces the companys Quest mixedreality ‌headsets smart glasses made with EssilorLuxotticas RayBan and upcoming augmentedreality glasses . Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community . However it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses as competitors such as Alphabets Google Apple and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts . The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valleys artificialintelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception . To fuel its ambitious goals Meta has committed as much as $ 72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year . Overall large tech companies are expected to spend around $ 400 billion on AI this year . The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with milliondollar pay packages ."

      "selftext": "Alcoa's (AA) stock price has recently shown a strong rally, climbing over 18% in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025. This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6% on December 3, 2025, reaching $44.09. This upward trend follows strong third-quarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts. Notably, the company has secured a 10-year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York. Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies, particularly data centers and batteries. The AI build-out is a major new demand driver for aluminum. Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks, cooling units, and radiators, as demand for the metal soars. In the battery sector, the global aluminum-based battery market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market, as the market is forecast to grow from $5 billion to over $12 billion by 2032. ...and one of the best things I've heard from the Investor's Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its non-used sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations. .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turn-around story for them?",

      "selftext_processed": "Alcoas AA stock price has recently shown a strong rally climbing over 18 % in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025 . This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6 % on December 3 2025 reaching $ 44.09 . This upward trend follows strong thirdquarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts . Notably the company has secured a 10year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York . Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies particularly data centers and batteries . The AI buildout is a major new demand driver for aluminum . Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks cooling units and radiators as demand for the metal soars . In the battery sector the global aluminumbased battery market is projected to grow significantly driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market as the market is forecast to grow from $ 5 billion to over $ 12 billion by 2032 . ... and one of the best things Ive heard from the Investors Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its nonused sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations . .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turnaround story for them"

I've been doing this for the last 9 years now and considering it's costing an average of $30k to purchase the house with deposits etc etc this is a return of roughly 8% give or take . Let's say prices rise 2-3% per year it's a 10-11% return . For the simplicity of it all is this why people just get an average of 10% in the stock market each year ? It seems like a crazy amount of work on my property end to make what people are in the S&P500 . I know the stock market goes up and down and end up averaging out but if I'm looking at the next 20years . What's everyone's thoughts on steering more toward the stocks market purely because it doubles every 9years or so on average I know . House prices I don't see doubling every 9-10year . Am I missing something here ? I'll add in that I've had a very successful run with property just wondering if it's time to park the $ in stocks rather than more roofs",

      "title": "if Tesla is just auto + energy till 2030, is mid-440s cheap or a joke?",
      "selftext": "I’ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow. Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful, and somehow the price just refuses to die. Since October it’s actually held up better than I expected: it was around $456 back then, dropped into the high $380s in November, bounced back to ~430, and now it’s sitting in the mid-440s. After all that noise, it’s basically only a small step down from October. What’s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn’t sounded great. I remember a bunch of pieces about “margins getting crushed” and “Tesla losing its EV lead” as cheaper EVs (especially from China) grabbed share. In places like France and Sweden, sales were down something like 40–50% YoY, and I just saw another article saying that in the UK, November sales were down about 19%, yet TSLA still roughly up 4%. After Q3, the stock did sell off for a bit, which kind of matched the mood: GAAP operating income down ~40% YoY, operating margin ~5.8%, total gross margin ~18%, auto gross margin ex-credits only mid-teens vs close to 30% at the peak. Revenue hit a record, but net income was still down ~35–40% YoY. The one real bright spot was they printed almost $4B in free cash flow and have over $40B in cash, so the balance sheet doesn’t really scare me. Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “very good” auto + energy business, I just can’t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety. For me to get more comfortable, I’d want either a clear trend of margin recovery, or the AI / FSD / robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the P&L instead of just keynotes and hype. So I’m honestly curious: if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto + energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis / robots aren’t huge before 2030, what kind of PE would you put on that? Under that assumption, is today’s price cheap, fair, or just straight-up expensive to you? And if I butchered any of these stats, feel free to correct me in the comments. aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff, this was the dashboard I was looking at: [Tesla UK sales down ~19% in November, New Automotive data shows.](",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow . Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful and somehow the price just refuses to die . Since October it ’ s actually held up better than I expected it was around $ 456 back then dropped into the high $ 380s in November bounced back to 430 and now it ’ s sitting in the mid440s . After all that noise it ’ s basically only a small step down from October . What ’ s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn ’ t sounded great . I remember a bunch of pieces about “ margins getting crushed ” and “ Tesla losing its EV lead ” as cheaper EVs especially from China grabbed share . In places like France and Sweden sales were down something like 40–50 % YoY and I just saw another article saying that in the UK November sales were down about 19 % yet TSLA still roughly up 4 % . After Q3 the stock did sell off for a bit which kind of matched the mood GAAP operating income down 40 % YoY operating margin 5.8 % total gross margin 18 % auto gross margin excredits only midteens vs close to 30 % at the peak . Revenue hit a record but net income was still down 35–40 % YoY . The one real bright spot was they printed almost $ 4B in free cash flow and have over $ 40B in cash so the balance sheet doesn ’ t really scare me . Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “ very good ” auto energy business I just can ’ t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety . For me to get more comfortable I ’ d want either a clear trend of margin recovery or the AI FSD robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the PL instead of just keynotes and hype . So I ’ m honestly curious if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis robots aren ’ t huge before 2030 what kind of PE would you put on that Under that assumption is today ’ s price cheap fair or just straightup expensive to you And if I butchered any of these stats feel free to correct me in the comments . aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff this was the dashboard I was looking at Tesla UK sales down 19 % in November New Automotive data shows ."

In the best case, I would make around an 11% profit if I sold during the buyback. However, I currently receive about a 10% dividend per year after taxes (based on the tax rules in my country). At the moment, I would not sell. I have held the stock for 12 months already, which means I have already gotten back 10% of my purchase price through dividends.

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then it's really hard to know if they actually own what they're talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow, just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably won't work out. I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe I'm not figuring out how to use it right? Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept it's not designed for serious analysis, what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment",

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then its really hard to know if they actually own what theyre talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably wont work out . I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe Im not_figuring out how to use it right Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept its not_designed for serious analysis what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment"

The only worrying and troubling thing is Charter Communications has billions and billions og dollars of debt on its current balance. I understand that this particular industry is very capital intensive, but this ​it still gives me pause. There is also the risk that in the medium term, Charter could lose customers to other companies in the industry. However, I'm still going to undertake a deep dive and do a full due diligence on the company and its stock. And, I must admit that when I crunch the numbers, I'm going to be very conservative in my estimates. 😊😊😊😊",

I bought in March during that random dip and just held. Boring but solid. Biggest regret? Selling too early on AMD. I took profits in May thinking it ran too far, too fast. Now I just stare at the chart sometimes and sigh. I’m starting to sketch out ideas for 2026. Thinking about leaning a bit more into dividend stocks and maybe some international ETFs, but not sure yet. So, curious to hear from other people. What was your best investment in 2025?

      "selftext": "Japan’s 10-year JGB yield touched 1.917% on Thursday the highest level since 2007. It’s basically the market’s way of signaling that investors aren’t fully convinced about the Bank of Japan’s current policy path. The BOJ is stuck between two bad options: Raise rates further: yields likely push even higher, tightening conditions at a time when parts of the economy are still fragile. Cut or stay on hold: risks re-accelerating inflation after spending most of the decade trying to get it under control. It’s one of those situations where any direction introduces new problems. The next BOJ meeting should be interesting because the window for “gentle normalization” looks like it’s narrowing fast. Source:",

      "selftext": "As of 2025, the amount of ETFs that exist on the US stock exchanges has surpassed the amount of stocks. Honestly, this surprised me and I didn't realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up. ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion, you used to be able to refer to them as the \"safer\" option to invest in, but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products, it's even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks. When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage, or 2x short Tesla, it's actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information. If people are willing to pay for products, companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that. [",

Honestly this surprised me and I didnt realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up . ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion you used to be able to refer to them as the safer option to invest in but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products its even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks . When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage or 2x short Tesla its actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information . If people are willing to pay for products companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that ."

      "selftext": "Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. ($CRWD) reported a classic beat and raise quarter last night, however the stock still sold off about 3% in after hours trading. Then this morning the stock opened even lower, falling to about $486. That ended up being the low of the day before it ripped almost 7% off the bottom and closed up around 1.5%. Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights, things that stood out to me: \\- Revenue grew 22% YoY to $1.23 billion, beating the $1.22 billion estimate \\- Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents, beating the 94 cent estimate \\- Added $265m of net new ARR in the quarter (+73% YoY) \\- ARR as of October 31st, 2025 was $4.92b (+23% YoY) \\- $398m in operating cash flow vs $326m last year \\- $296m in free cash flow vs $231m last year \\- Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and net new ARR. CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him. This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings, and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and don't know why they sold. Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically, and this time doesn't look any different to me. The fundamentals here are strong, this quarter lines up the next leg of growth, and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market. So at these levels, do you guys view $CRWD as a buy, hold, or sell? (I do personally own the stock).",

      "selftext_processed": "Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. $ CRWD reported a classic beat and raise quarter last night however the stock still sold off about 3 % in after hours trading . Then this morning the stock opened even lower falling to about $ 486 . That ended up being the low of the day before it ripped almost 7 % off the bottom and closed up around 1.5 % . Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights things that stood out to me Revenue grew 22 % YoY to $ 1.23 billion beating the $ 1.22 billion estimate Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents beating the 94 cent estimate Added $ 265m of net new ARR in the quarter 73 % YoY ARR as of October 31st 2025 was $ 4.92b 23 % YoY $ 398m in operating cash flow vs $ 326m last year $ 296m in free cash flow vs $ 231m last year Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS operating cash flow free cash flow and net new ARR . CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him . This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and dont know why they sold . Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically and this time doesnt look any different to me . The fundamentals here are strong this quarter lines up the next leg of growth and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market . So at these levels do you guys view $ CRWD as a buy hold or sell I do personally own the stock ."

      "selftext": "What are your thoughts on ADBE before they report earnings on Dec 10? The company is down 37% over the last year and 25.9% YTD. They are currently trading at a PE of 20 (5 year average is 41), while the S&P is trading at a PE ratio of 30. The company is growing revenue by about 10% year over year vs the S&P at 5%. They also have very little debt, coming in at 4% vs the average of the S&P at 25%. They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter. They grew free cash flow by 52% over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares (25 billion through 2028 to be exact). Adobe’s profit margins are steady at 29% over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10% per year since 2022. They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at, and yet the price continues to fall. Am I missing something here? I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn’t like them, but the numbers don’t reflect that. I also hear that as much as the user base does not like their pricing, they have no other alternative but to use their products. Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels? If not, what price are you looking to start a position? Or why are you not starting a position?",

They are currently trading at a PE of 20 5 year average is 41 while the SP is trading at a PE ratio of 30 . The company is growing revenue by about 10 % year over year vs the SP at 5 % . They also have very little debt coming in at 4 % vs the average of the SP at 25 % . They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter . They grew free cash flow by 52 % over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares 25 billion through 2028 to be exact . Adobe ’ s profit margins are steady at 29 % over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10 % per year since 2022 . They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at and yet the price continues to fall . Am I missing something here I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn ’ t like them but the numbers don ’ t reflect that . I also hear that as much as the user base does not_like their pricing they have no_other alternative but to use their products . Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels If not_what price are you looking to start a position Or why are you not_starting a position"

      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about the fabled “AI Bubble” but I see a much different problem all together. Here’s what I see in phases. Just my DD. Phase 1: AI demand will keep exploding for years, like a river that keeps widening no matter how many dams you build. Look at the Micron news recently, or the Genesis Executive Order. The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave, even if the economy is doing crap (it is). Phase 2: Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can’t get entry level jobs. Right now, AI layoffs feel like cutting “cost fat,” but if they keep going, you’re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive. Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke? Who will buy a house when they can’t establish credit or a down payment? You see how this trickles? Phase 3: Structural unemployment doesn’t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries. I’m talking entry level positions in finance, HR, hospitality, etc, etc. Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entry-level coding, customer support, basic analysis, HR screening, or content production, companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans, so those roles don’t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay. Over time, this creates a gap: a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no longer exist, while new AI-era jobs (prompt engineers, system architects, AI ops, etc.) require skills, credentials, or geography that many of them don’t have. What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don’t have a career option in their major? *This is kind of a doomer post, so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong. I hope this country can thrive, but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming.",

Phase 1 AI demand will keep exploding for years like a river that keeps widening no_matter how many dams you build . Look at the Micron news recently or the Genesis Executive Order . The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave even if the economy is doing crap it is . Phase 2 Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can ’ t get entry level jobs . Right now AI layoffs feel like cutting “ cost fat ” but if they keep going you ’ re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive . Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke Who will buy a house when they can ’ t establish credit or a down payment You see how this trickles Phase 3 Structural unemployment doesn ’ t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries . I ’ m talking entry level positions in finance HR hospitality etc etc . Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entrylevel coding customer support basic analysis HR screening or content production companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans so those roles don ’ t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay . Over time this creates a gap a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no_longer exist while new AIera jobs prompt engineers system architects AI ops etc . require skills credentials or geography that many of them don ’ t have . What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don ’ t have a career option in their major This is kind of a doomer post so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong . I hope this country can thrive but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming ."

      "selftext": "CME FedWatch s latest data shows: The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in December has risen to 89%. The probability of maintaining rates unchanged is approximately 11%. By January next year, the cumulative probability of a 25 basis point rate cut stands at about 65%, while the probability of a 50 basis-point cut is approximately 28%. As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading, this shift is hard to ignore. My key considerations: If rate cuts materialize: Could drive gains in tech, high growth, and high beta sectors, potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side: Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a rate-cut environment, though rate-sensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution: If markets overprice “easing” expectations, a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives: With rising probability of rate cuts, would you preemptively position in growth stocks/tech sectors, or maintain defensive holdings/cash reserves? If trading options or high volatility assets, how would you manage potential market turbulence? Is this a trend driven opportunity or a short-term sentiment-fueled rally? Share your insights or strategies this is an opportunity to reassess positions, not blindly chase highs.",

The probability of maintaining rates unchanged is approximately 11 % . By January next year the cumulative probability of a 25 basis point rate cut stands at about 65 % while the probability of a 50 basispoint cut is approximately 28 % . As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading this shift is hard to ignore . My key considerations If rate cuts materialize Could drive gains in tech high growth and high beta sectors potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a ratecut environment though ratesensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution If markets overprice “ easing ” expectations a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives With rising probability of rate cuts would you preemptively position in growth stockstech sectors or maintain defensive holdingscash reserves If trading options or high volatility assets how would you manage potential market turbulence Is this a trend driven opportunity or a shortterm sentimentfueled rally Share your insights or strategies this is an opportunity to reassess positions not_blindly chase highs ."

      "selftext": "Thesis: High-quality business with durable competitive advantages trading at a reasonable price, now with improving capital allocation. Moat: Search dominance (90% share) and network effects. AI Infrastructure: Proprietary TPUs provide a cost/performance advantage over peers relying solely on Nvidia. Capital Return: Shift from cash hoarding to shareholder returns (buybacks + dividends). Valuation check: Trades at 27.1x P/E, which is a 27% discount to the peer group average of 37x. Durable advantage + reasonable price. Business Segments: Search: $56.6B revenue (Q3 '24), 14.5% YoY growth. 90% global market share remains stable despite AI threats. YouTube: $50B+ revenue (ads + subs). 2.53B reach. Dominant in streaming watch time. Cloud (GCP): $15.2B revenue (Q3 '25), 30% YoY growth, 24% operating margins. 90% of AI unicorns use GCP. Financial Health: Cash: $66.7B TTM Free Cash Flow (3.2% yield). Balance Sheet: Fortress balance sheet with $76.9B net cash and minimal debt (0.11 D/E ratio). Management (Sundar Pichai): Proven track record (Chrome, Android integration, GCP growth from 6% to 13% share). Successfully navigated AI pivot with Gemini deployment to 1B+ users. Multiples: Current P/E: 27.1x. • FCF Yield: \\~3.2%. Total Yield: \\~2.3% (2% buyback yield + 0.3% dividend yield). Capital Allocation: retiring 2-3% of shares annually; initiated first-ever dividend ($0.20/quarter). Low payout ratio (8.29%) leaves room for growth. Market Positioning: Not cheap, but valuation is attractive relative to the S&P 500 and tech peers. TPU Advantage: Vertically integrated chip stack allows for lower cost of compute for AI, protecting margins better than competitors renting Nvidia GPUs. Expert Views: Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO): Acknowledged the quality of Google's TPU program. Internal Sentiment: CEO Pichai maintains top 5% approval ratings among peer CEOs. Competitive Check: Gemini 3 Pro and Veo 3 killing it on benchmarks. Here's my workflow visualized: [ BUY / BULLISH Conclusion: Alphabet offers a rare combination of growth (Cloud/AI) and value (Search cash cow). The transition to custom silicon (TPUs) creates a defensible long-term infrastructure advantage, while the new capital return program sets a floor for investor returns. Risks regarding AI disruption in search are mitigated by their own AI integration and hardware advantages.",

Memory shortage could delay AI projects, productivity gains. SK Hynix predicts memory shortage to last through late 2027. Smartphone makers warn of price rises due to soaring memory costs. An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumer-electronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies, as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data. The squeeze spans almost every type of memory, from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that feeds AI chips in data centers. Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February, according to market-research firm TrendForce, drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run. The fallout could reach beyond tech. Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AI-based productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure. It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate US tariffs.

These include SNAP, RDDT, X, etc. Most concerning is I doubt most of these will ever reward patient shareholders. What I don't understand is why so many companies are unable to translate web traffic into revenue. Above all, how to spot the brands that are getting it right.",

I know the fees are super high with Edward jones and I feel pretty terrible about basically dealing with that for a decade but it has to be better than not investing at all right?

Then I started looking at what other people actually hold on blossom and man that was humbling as hell, like I'm sitting here proud of my 40% voo 30% individual stocks 30% cash thinking I'm being smart and diversified, meanwhile everyone else my age is way more aggressive and honestly crushing it because of it. For instance I saw one dude's portfolio that's like 80% growth stocks and he's up 45% this year while I'm at maybe 18%, which made me realize I'm probably being too conservative for someone with 35 years till retirement, but the weirdest part was seeing how many people just hold 3-5 positions total and do better than my diversified 25 stock portfolio, kinda makes you question if diversification is actually helping or just watering down returns tbh. Not saying I'm gonna copy what other people do but it def made me rethink my whole approach, like maybe I should take more risk while I'm young instead of investing like I'm already 50, idk… anyone else compares their portfolio to others and realizes you're way more conservative than you thought? Kinda a weird feeling…",

Then I started looking at what other people actually hold on blossom and man that was humbling as hell like Im sitting here proud of my 40 % voo 30 % individual stocks 30 % cash thinking Im being smart and diversified meanwhile everyone else my age is way more aggressive and honestly crushing it because of it . For instance I saw one dudes portfolio thats like 80 % growth stocks and hes up 45 % this year while Im at maybe 18 % which made me realize Im probably being too conservative for someone with 35 years till retirement but the weirdest part was seeing how many people just hold 35 positions total and do better than my diversified 25 stock portfolio kinda makes you question if diversification is actually helping or just watering down returns tbh . Not_saying Im gon na copy what other people do but it def made me rethink my whole approach like maybe I should take more risk while Im young instead of investing like Im already 50 idk… anyone else compares their portfolio to others and realizes youre way more conservative than you thought Kinda a weird feeling…"

      "selftext": "Have been doing business with a hard money lending investment partnership. Generally I have been collecting an average of 9.5% interest on each deal, with the deals being 12 months and backed up by 50% LTV real estate. Not crazy minimums, around 25K USD. All of my investments have performed and none defaulted, pretty solid underwriting and only on commercial stuff. Here is my question…I can borrow against my investment portfolio at a 4.97% rate, risk being it is variable and tied to fed rate. Is it a completely foolish idea to borrow against this, lend the money via the hard money lender, and make the difference on the spread of the two rates?",

All of my investments have performed and none defaulted pretty solid underwriting and only on commercial stuff . Here is my question…I can borrow against my investment portfolio at a 4.97 % rate risk being it is variable and tied to fed rate . Is it a completely foolish idea to borrow against this lend the money via the hard money lender and make the difference on the spread of the two rates"

      "selftext": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom, market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle (ORCL.US) might issue up to $100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions. Worries over Oracle's debt situation drove its five year credit default swap (CDS) to surge to a three year high. However, BNP Paribas believes Oracle's actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $100 billion. Therefore, Oracle may only need to issue $25 billion to $35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development. While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the company's recent $18 billion bond offering, it remains far below the $100 billion level that had investors concerned. It's worth noting that given Oracle's high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business, we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden. Management could also explore alternative financing solutions (such as vendor financing) to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures. Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “Overweight” rating, but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations, some have lowered their target price from $430 to $390. Furthermore, the market currently prices Oracle's collaboration with OpenAI at only a “minimal upside.” This can be calculated: approximately 84% of Oracle's current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses. Estimates suggest Oracle's cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027. This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets.",

If Polymarket (or any regulated on chain exchange) enters the U.S. with the same user experience but legal clarity, the old sportsbook model stops being competitive overnight.

      "selftext": "Microsoft shares dipped a bit today after a report suggested the company cut sales quotas for some of its AI software offerings. According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed. Curious how others read this growing pains, or an early sign that AI adoption inside large companies is slower than the narrative suggests? Source :",

      "selftext": "Here are a few stocks I'm tracking and analyzing: 1. AVGO: Broadcom's custom AI accelerators and networking equipment appear poised for sustained momentum, and their valuations seem more reasonable compared to stocks purely riding hype. 2. MSFT: Cloud and enterprise demand remain robust; while less flashy than other stocks, Microsoft's shares offer greater safety if the macroeconomy stumbles. 3. GOOGL: They continue to profit from advertising and cloud services, and their investments in AI appear promising. I'm not looking for potential winners, but rather which stocks might actually hold up through the end of the year or even continue to rise in December. I'd appreciate your valuable insights. Invest cautiously don't blindly follow trends!!!!!",

AVGO Broadcoms custom AI accelerators and networking equipment appear poised for sustained momentum and their valuations seem more reasonable compared to stocks purely riding hype . 2 . MSFT Cloud and enterprise demand remain robust while less flashy than other stocks Microsofts shares offer greater safety if the macroeconomy stumbles . 3 . GOOGL They continue to profit from advertising and cloud services and their investments in AI appear promising . Im not_looking for potential winners but rather which stocks might actually hold up through the end of the year or even continue to rise in December . Id appreciate your valuable insights . Invest cautiously dont blindly follow trends"

Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.

      "title": "Macy’s drops 7% pre-market on strongest growth in 3 years while raising outlook and warning on holiday spending and tariffs",
      "selftext": "No paywall: [ >Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum. >The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion. >Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace. >It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. >Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. >And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter. >Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday. >In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season. >“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. >He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury. >Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: >Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents >Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected >Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open. >Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. >The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. >In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents. >Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter. >In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%. >Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%. >Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs. >He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. >“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.” >The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. >For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors. >Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said. >Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs. >As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "No_paywall Macy ’ s on Wednesday beat Wall Street ’ s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company ’ s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum . The department store operator raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook after its betterthanexpected fiscal third quarter . The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2 and $ 2.20 up from its previous expectation of $ 1.70 to $ 2.05 and net sales of $ 21.48 billion to $ 21.63 billion compared with its prior outlook of $ 21.15 billion and $ 21.45 billion . Macy ’ s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5 % comparable sales growth from the previous year . That compares to its previous expectations for a yearoveryear decline of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % . The industry metric takes out onetime dynamics like store openings and closures and Macy ’ s includes merchandise that it owns items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its thirdparty online marketplace . It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy ’ s raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook . The company had cut its fullyear earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs more promotions and “ some moderation ” in discretionary spending . Even so the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the yearago net sales of $ 22.29 billion . Macy ’ s said about $ 700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year which ended Feb. 1 and in the early part of this fiscal year . And Macy ’ s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter . Shares dropped about 6 % in premarket trading on Wednesday . In an interview with CNBC CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “ prudent view ” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough yearoveryear comparisons and because it ’ s not_sure how “ aspirational customers ” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured may spend during the season . “ We ’ re pleased with the fourth quarter to date but we have a big holiday in front of us ” he said . He said Macy ’ s department store model is an advantage during the giftgiving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices from offprice to luxury . Here ’ s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue $ 4.71 billion vs. $ 4.62 billion expected Macy ’ s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales particularly for its namesake brand . Macy ’ s department stores account for the majority of the New York Citybased legacy retailer ’ s business but their performance has lagged behind the company ’ s higherend department store Bloomingdale ’ s and beauty chain Bluemercury . To try to reverse that trend the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing sharper merchandise and eyecatching displays at Macy ’ s stores . It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations which were dubbed the “ First 50 ” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy ’ s locations . That ’ s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy ’ s plans to keep open . Along with the added investment it has shuttered lowerperforming Macy ’ s locations . It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027 while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale ’ s and Bluemercury . The company hasn ’ t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year . In the threemonth period that ended Nov. 1 Macy ’ s net income fell to $ 11 million or 4 cents per share compared with $ 28 million or 10 cents per share in the yearago period . Adjusting for some onetime items including gains on the sale of real estate it reported earnings per share of 9 cents . Revenue decreased from $ 4.74 billion in the yearago quarter . In the fiscal third quarter companywide comparable sales rose 3.2 % including owned and licensed merchandise and its thirdparty marketplace . When the company excluded stores that won ’ t be part of its goforward business that growth was 3.4 % . Bloomingdale ’ s posted the strongest performance of the company ’ s brands with comparable sales jumping 9 % year over year on an ownedpluslicensed basis including its thirdparty marketplace . And Bluemercury ’ s comparable sales increased 1.1 % . Spring attributed the company ’ s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy ’ s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like highend home goods company MacKenzieChilds . He said he visited Macy ’ s stores and those of its competitors on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw . “ I like the way we ’ re showing up ” he said . “ We look crisp . We look clean . We look interesting compelling inspiring easy to shop. ” The snap to cooler weather helped too he said . As temperatures turned cooler in October shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters outerwear and boots . For the holiday season Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the yearago period at Macy ’ s stores and website along with those of its competitors . Higher tariffs however will mean higher prices for some items . Macy ’ s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected he said . Still Spring said Macy ’ s has made “ selective ” price increases in almost every category with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs . As of Tuesday ’ s close Macy ’ s shares have risen about 34 % so far this year . That outpaces the SP 500′s 16 % gains during the same period . Macy ’ s stock closed Tuesday at $ 22.71 bringing the company ’ s market cap to about $ 6.10 billion ."

We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future). Currently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months. In nana we trust.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, 22M here. I’m current sitting on $24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up. I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on, and want to start thinking a bit more long term. I previously thought of going 60% nasdaq and 40% all world, but at my age this seems a bit too boring. I want to be a bit more risky until age 25-30 before I start to get super safe with my investments. So I was thinking 100% Mag-7. Like I mentioned i’ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk, and this would be for long term holding. I would contribute around $600/month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction, then would go all in with the $24k (into Mag-7, and save about 20% for some high risk AI/Nuclear/Quantum plays). Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i’m not missing anything important, besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride. Thanks",

I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on and want to start thinking a bit more long term . I previously thought of going 60 % nasdaq and 40 % all world but at my age this seems a bit too boring . I want to be a bit more risky until age 2530 before I start to get super safe with my investments . So I was thinking 100 % Mag7 . Like I mentioned i ’ ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk and this would be for long term holding . I would contribute around $ 600month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction then would go all in with the $ 24k into Mag7 and save about 20 % for some high risk AINuclearQuantum plays . Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i ’ m not_missing anything important besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Hello all! My parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&P-500-level returns with a little diversification. They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week. Here’s the rough allocation we’re considering: U.S. Large Cap (S&P-ish): SCHX – 40% Total U.S. Market: SCHB – 30% Developed International: SCHF – 10% Emerging Markets: SCHE – 5% U.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10% TIPS: SCHP – 5% All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab. Questions: 1. Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately? 2. Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)? 3. Would a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate? 4. Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY? Thanks in advance for any input.",

Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate). (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL) If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns. I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%). I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing. Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money. I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan. I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

It’s a tough decision tho bcuz my S&P position has outperformed due to just position size alone. Even tho my Apple position is up 33%. What are yall in?",

      "selftext": "You don't need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musk's LIES. Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla. Let’s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed. Feel free to verify each statement yourself :) Long story short, Burry said has an history of going all-in in whatever sounds cool, rarely following up on promises and that competition wins. Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 2020/2021. He then moved to full-self driving as its \"main goal\", but Google’s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4. Tesla? 20 cars that still need supervision (level 2+) but hear me out, he's gonna DOUBLE it to 40 by late December. Ready for the misleading headlines \"Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network\" ??? So after failing with this, he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots. Last year he promised by the end of this year he'd produce 5000 robots. Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that’s just what he dies. He got his Trillion dollar package, he's good. In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality... so, as Burry said, the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elon's total addressable market. Now, I personally don't trust a management who doesn't offer reliable projections. When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls, their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up. Just take note, for each company, of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters, set it on your calendar to check back on it and you’ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don’t have time to listen/read all of the guidance, copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto :) ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious, never overpromises and often overdelivers. That's a company you can trust. That's a company who's CEO words are worth something while Elon's at this point is just toilet paper. Guy is not a genius, he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is. This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world. Then he takes all the credit, as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is. You don't need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud, you just need to actually listen what he says and how he's just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says. He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved, the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and ego-driven adventures against OpenAI, , and whomever proved to be better than him at executing. To be complete, here's the list of unmet promises: - $25000 family car: promised in 2006. January 2025 he confirmed production would start, later scrapped the plan in April 2025. - Cheaper models announced late 2024: delayed to prioritize Cybertruck (which was a complete failure) - Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production. Delayed every year since then, new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered. - New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production, Delayed every year since then. - Unsupervised full self driving in Austin: promised by June 2025, still not achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size. - Large-scale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles: bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far. - Self-delivering teslas: promised by 2019, never realized. IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER I'm not saying you should sell. Just stay informed, read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock. You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk, knowing there's a history of missing deadlines, promises and flip-flop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail. The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true, but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon. Ignore people with aggressive ideas, they are just desperate Read the comments, you’ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts.

      "selftext_processed": "You dont need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musks LIES . Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla . Let ’ s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed . Feel free to verify each statement yourself Long story short Burry said has an history of going allin in whatever sounds cool rarely following up on promises and that competition wins . Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 20202021 . He then moved to fullself driving as its main goal but Google ’ s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4 . Tesla 20 cars that still need supervision level 2 but hear me out hes gon na DOUBLE it to 40 by late December . Ready for the misleading headlines Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network So after failing with this he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots . Last year he promised by the end of this year hed produce 5000 robots . Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that ’ s just what he dies . He got his Trillion dollar package hes good . In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality ... so as Burry said the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elons total addressable market . Now I personally dont trust a management who doesnt offer reliable projections . When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up . Just take note for each company of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters set it on your calendar to check back on it and you ’ ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don ’ t have time to listenread all of the guidance copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious never_overpromises and often overdelivers . Thats a company you can trust . Thats a company whos CEO words are worth something while Elons at this point is just toilet paper . Guy is not_a genius he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is . This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world . Then he takes all the credit as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is . You dont need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud you just need to actually listen what he says and how hes just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says . He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and egodriven adventures against OpenAI and whomever proved to be better than him at executing . To be complete heres the list of unmet promises $ 25000 family car promised in 2006 . January 2025 he confirmed production would start later scrapped the plan in April 2025 . Cheaper models announced late 2024 delayed to prioritize Cybertruck which was a complete failure Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production . Delayed every year since then new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered . New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production Delayed every year since then . Unsupervised full self driving in Austin promised by June 2025 still not_achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size . Largescale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far . Selfdelivering teslas promised by 2019 never_realized . IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER Im not_saying you should sell . Just stay informed read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock . You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk knowing theres a history of missing deadlines promises and flipflop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail . The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon . Ignore people with aggressive ideas they are just desperate Read the comments you ’ ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts . Stay safe stay invested Credits to Ettore Mihaili from Netherlands"

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%. A little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up. But, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? Thank you!",

      "title": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout",
      "selftext": "Disclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows: Since inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues: -Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators. -Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders. -Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better. -Ad stack worst-in-class. -Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure. -Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power. -Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe. SNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below: -Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense. -Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers. -They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue. -They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide. SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive. What investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout. Regarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come. As for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results. In conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclosure long 250000 shares at $ 7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike postQ3 earnings making about $ 200k . However I now look at SNAP as more of a longerterm investment and my thesis follows Since inception SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can ’ t make money which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do . It faces the following issues Founders control the voting rights and haven ’ t been the best capital allocators . Egregious stockbased comp has diluted shareholders . Best features like Stories copied by META and monetized much better . Ad stack worstinclass . Very high operating costs mainly due to infrastructure . Young users hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power . Growing fast mainly in lowincome countries like Indian and Pakistan yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe . SNAP as Spiegel mentioned recently is at a crossroads . It can die a slow unprofitable death or it can innovate and start to make money for once . It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now and I will mention why below Started offering various subscriptions including Snapchat Memories Storage Lens and Platinum . Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $ 750 million year for now and is growing double digits which is unique among its peers . I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center such as Icloud storage Google etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there . The download and import process isn ’ t that easy and there will be friction . A certain number of users will say “ screw it I ’ ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it ” . Meanwhile the users that do not_pay for it will be limited in storage thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense . Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement . After all what use is having hordes of users if you can not make money off of them Sometimes you indeed have to “ fire ” your customers . They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature as well as Sponsored Snaps with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages . The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not_vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue . They recently reorganized into small nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy . The Snapchat success was created by a small team for example so they decided to scale this operationally companywide . SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “ thing ” I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology . They have the most used AR products in the world and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year . Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves which is also a positive as I don ’ t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account . Personally I do not_feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success mainly because SNAP has no_record of being successful in hardware . I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well . If they bomb then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward which would also be a positive . What investors need to think about is this How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU SNAP has that yet only has a $ 13 billion market cap . Ideally the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials . Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs a better ads platform and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically . However I ’ m not_playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares and a takeover won ’ t happen unless they want it to happen . More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout . Regarding stockbased comp dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped and while it is still relatively high management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked . They recently announced a $ 500 million buyback and I think we will see more to come . As for the recent $ 400 million Perplexity deal I see it as a oneoff and don ’ t ascribe much value to it for now especially since Evan said they won ’ t sell advertising against the chatbot results . In conclusion I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year . I don ’ t have a target price on the stock per se but it could become a $ 100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should ."

I have a post-tax account and a pre-tax Traditional IRA. The post-tax account is mainly comprised of ETF's while the pre-tax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks. I want to move the money to something like FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index) with maybe a little bit of FSPSX (Fidelity International Index) for international exposure, and maybe just a touch of FTBFX (Fidelity Total Bond) for balancing purposes - although probably unnecessary right now. Set, forget, and make auto-contributions monthly. Never look at it. This is long term, I am very confident I won't need the money for 20+ years. 1. For the post-tax account, is the easiest (and/or only) way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETF's, withdraw the cash to my bank account, and then re-buy the Index Funds under my self-managed account? I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season. 2. For the Traditional IRA I obviously cannot withdraw the cash, so how would this one work? Thanks.",

      "selftext": "I've been tracking recent reports that NVIDIA is now carrying a massive pile of unsold chips especially the H20 units built for China and the company has already written down billions after export curbs blocked sales. Meanwhile, the rumor mill is heating up: Google’s custom AI chips (TPUs / in-house silicon) might start hitting the broader AI-infrastructure market soon. If Google (or any big tech) begins selling in volume, we could see chip oversupply + falling prices + fierce competition the perfect storm for a big player with dead inventory. That means all those unsold GPUs and AI chips on NVIDIA’s balance sheet could turn into a serious liability leading not just to a stock dip, but possibly a collapse in GPU-driven AI dominance. Would love to hear from folks here: **Do you think this is just panic or a legitimate risk for NVIDIA? If you were building an AI/data-center stack now would you bet on GPUs or wait for custom silicon from Google/others?**",

Meanwhile the rumor mill is heating up Google ’ s custom AI chips TPUs inhouse silicon might start hitting the broader AIinfrastructure market soon . If Google or any big tech begins selling in volume we could see chip oversupply falling prices fierce competition the perfect storm for a big player with dead inventory . That means all those unsold GPUs and AI chips on NVIDIA ’ s balance sheet could turn into a serious liability leading not_just to a stock dip but possibly a collapse in GPUdriven AI dominance . Would love to hear from folks here Do you think this is just panic or a legitimate risk for NVIDIA If you were building an AIdatacenter stack now would you bet on GPUs or wait for custom silicon from Googleothers"

      "selftext": "[My original DD for SEZL is here]( Previous post if you haven't seen it yet \\^, little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL: **BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now. It's not nearly as irresponsible or \"set to blow up\" as the general sentiment makes it out to be.** 1. Standard loan tenor of Sezzle's BNPL average 40-50 days, with AOVs being $100-250. 2. BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx. 2% versus Credit Cards at 10%. People use Sezzle for groceries, gas, and other essentials/semi-essentials. Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs. 3. Sezzle does NOT make money off of defaulting consumers! The long-term value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time. They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition - again, short-term pain for long term customer filtering. 4. Limits and product usage can be changed instantly, versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice. Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time. 5. CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzle's target base is already low-mid income; consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance. **6. Management from Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, Zip (BNPL providers) all noted no negative changes in repayment ability - Affirm CEO actually noted that govt. workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise.** 7. Points 1-6 point to the low-risk of these loans compared to CCs, Auto, Mortgages etc. due to the nature of their AOV + importance to the consumer. 8. The misconception that \"people will stop paying their BNPL loans first\". ZERO data to suggest this. Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario, along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs. People would much rather pay off the $100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever. 9. Sezzle offers optional credit-reporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour, along with their tier program. **What has overshadowed the share price as of late?** 1. Liquidity risk-off from high-beta stocks in recent weeks (late Oct-now) 2. Rising delinquency rates that were guided for, in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment & shaky macro news. Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2% to 3% in recent quarter, BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.5-2.75%, from original guide of 2.5-3%. 3. Compressed net margin from 28% Q2 to 23% Q3 - mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates, again, were guided for at start of the year. Should not be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product (subscriptions versus one-time use card). Expecting 25-27.5% stable net margin for 2026. There is SOME real concern here but not scary enough to lose conviction IMO. **Why I believe upside is 100% from here (6m+ hold)** 1. Re-shift to subscription mid Q3 netted +80,000 active subscribers. Assume minimum 120,000/Q add for the next 3-4 quarters: this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR, as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins. Their previous focus in Q1-3 was a lower margin, less sticky product which proved to not be as beneficial, hence the switch. Will be a $15M+ figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q1-2026. 1.5. Active consumers expected to grow @ 4-6% QoQ & payback period of 6-9 months on marketing spend (8M/quarter) will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters & beyond. 2. Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant \"fear\" classification. The fears are not completely unwarranted, but for the most part, blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space. This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour. 3. Continued penetration of consumer acquisition + general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users, and consequently revenue. 4. Trading at 14 NTM P/E growing at 60% YoY revenue & Net Income. History of earnings double beat. 5. Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged - management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentiment/repayment ability is low. Anticipating this to be closer to 4.5-5. 6. As bad as it may sound, their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials - cutting this service out of the user's life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it. End of the day, no different from a Credit Card. 7. Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners. *Conclusion: QE begins, market sentiment changes to \"BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears\", company performance will continue to deliver, and multiple expansion will persist to re-rate the company closer to 20-25x NTM P/E.* BASE case: assuming 20-25x NTM P/E: EPS 5.5 NTM @ May 2026: SP of $110-137.50. BULL case (short/gamma squeeze, unlikely, but happened May 2025): 35-40x NTM P/E, $200+ possible. UNLIKELY by EOY2026. **Positions have rotated into 800 shares. Options IV is way too high @ 90%.**",

      "selftext_processed": "My original DD for SEZL is here Previous post if you havent seen it yet little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now . Its not_nearly as irresponsible or set to blow up as the general sentiment makes it out to be . 1 . Standard loan tenor of Sezzles BNPL average 4050 days with AOVs being $ 100250 . 2 . BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx . 2 % versus Credit Cards at 10 % . People use Sezzle for groceries gas and other essentialssemiessentials . Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs . 3 . Sezzle does NOT_make money off of defaulting consumers The longterm value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time . They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition again shortterm pain for long term customer filtering . 4 . Limits and product usage can be changed instantly versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice . Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time . 5 . CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzles target base is already lowmid income consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance . 6 . Management from Affirm Klarna Sezzle Zip BNPL providers all noted no_negative changes in repayment ability Affirm CEO actually noted that govt . workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise . 7 . Points 16 point to the lowrisk of these loans compared to CCs Auto Mortgages etc . due to the nature of their AOV importance to the consumer . 8 . The misconception that people will stop paying their BNPL loans first . ZERO data to suggest this . Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs . People would much rather pay off the $ 100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever . 9 . Sezzle offers optional creditreporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour along with their tier program . What has overshadowed the share price as of late 1 . Liquidity riskoff from highbeta stocks in recent weeks late Octnow 2 . Rising delinquency rates that were guided for in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment shaky macro news . Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2 % to 3 % in recent quarter BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.52.75 % from original guide of 2.53 % . 3 . Compressed net margin from 28 % Q2 to 23 % Q3 mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates again were guided for at start of the year . Should not_be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product subscriptions versus onetime use card . Expecting 2527.5 % stable net margin for 2026 . There is SOME real concern here but not_scary enough to lose conviction IMO . Why I believe upside is 100 % from here 6m hold 1 . Reshift to subscription mid Q3 netted 80000 active subscribers . Assume minimum 120000Q add for the next 34 quarters this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins . Their previous focus in Q13 was a lower margin less sticky product which proved to not_be as beneficial hence the switch . Will be a $ 15M figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q12026 . 1.5 . Active consumers expected to grow 46 % QoQ payback period of 69 months on marketing spend 8Mquarter will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters beyond . 2 . Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant fear classification . The fears are not_completely unwarranted but for the most part blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space . This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour . 3 . Continued penetration of consumer acquisition general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users and consequently revenue . 4 . Trading at 14 NTM PE growing at 60 % YoY revenue Net Income . History of earnings double beat . 5 . Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentimentrepayment ability is low . Anticipating this to be closer to 4.55 . 6 . As bad as it may sound their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials cutting this service out of the users life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it . End of the day no_different from a Credit Card . 7 . Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners . Conclusion QE begins market sentiment changes to BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears company performance will continue to deliver and multiple expansion will persist to rerate the company closer to 2025x NTM PE . BASE case assuming 2025x NTM PE EPS 5.5 NTM May 2026 SP of $ 110137.50 . BULL case shortgamma squeeze unlikely but happened May 2025 3540x NTM PE $ 200 possible . UNLIKELY by EOY2026 . Positions have rotated into 800 shares . Options IV is way too high 90 % ."

      "selftext": "[Last post]( I had a $2.1M account with $1M in gains. In 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago]( I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M. [Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains]( That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios: [I \\(blue\\) am +263&#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&#37; over that time period]( The account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided. Summary: \\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin. \\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.** [Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options]( Q&A 1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?* \\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this? 2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?* \\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017. *3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?* \\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

In 6 months the account grew another $ 470K so Im at $ 1.5M of total gains since my first post 5 and a half years ago I did withdraw $ 250K to buy a new home so the account sits at $ 2.3M . Ending Net Deposits $ 1.5M in gains Thats a 27 % compound return a year for nearly 6 years . I continue to crush regular rstock boomer index fund portfolios I blue am 26337 while stocks green are barely 10037 over that time period The account has $ 7.3M assets and $ 5M borrowed in options so thats 3.2x leverage . Im underleveraged I know . The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $ 2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage . I havent decided . Summary Borrow 24x the value of your account on margin . Dump it all in a multiasset diversified portfolio . For the stock sleeve I prefer smartbeta funds due to their higher expected returns . The goal is maximum compound returns . Positions Stocks bonds mutual funds and $ 5M borrowed in Box Spread Options QA 1 When will you deleverpayoff the debtliquidate Never_This maximizes returns . Why do anything but this 2 Whats it like for your account to grow $ 1M per year Its cool you should try it . Save what you can invest it like this and give it time . I started with just $ 20K in 2017 . 3 Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere I have every penny riding in here . Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27 % per year so why do that"

      "selftext": "🚨🚨 BARRICK MINING (GOLD CHAD OF THE CENTURY) DD 🚨🚨 aka: Why $GOLD is about to melt faces harder than a 1999 dot-com chart but with ACTUAL PROFITS Listen up you smooth-brained degenerates who think “diversification” means buying calls AND puts on the same ticker. I bring you THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The One True DD. The post that will make your future grandchildren ask, “Grandpa, how did you become disgustingly wealthy?” And you’ll just whisper… “Barrick, my child.” ⸻ 💰 THE SETUP: BARRICK IS PRIMED TO GO GOD MODE Here’s what’s cooking hotter than Mali during the wet season: 1️⃣ S&P500 Inclusion → +$10 share price Index funds will have to buy this like a boomer panic-buying toilet paper in 2020. Guaranteed forced buying = tendies. 2️⃣ Analyst Price Targets Averaging $46 Wall Street FINALLY woke up from their coke-coma and realized Barrick isn’t some penny stock miner digging with spoons. 3️⃣ FOURMILE MINE = THE NEVADA GIGACHAD • Literally the #1 best mine discovery of our generation • Doesn’t require double fraction processing like the other peasant mines • Single fraction extraction = lower cost = higher profit = more stonk go up This thing prints gold like a stimmy printer in 2020. 4️⃣ Mali Resolution → +$10 share price No more geopolitical headache. Add another $10 because peace = profits. 5️⃣ Production Increasing 6% Every Year Imagine a miner that actually grows instead of declining like your OTM calls. Wild. ⸻ 🪙 THE GOLD MATH (YES, I DID MATH. YOU’RE WELCOME.) At different gold prices, Barrick is basically a cheat code: • $55 share price @ $3300 gold • $65 @ $3700 • Bank of America says $4000 gold by end of 2025 • $75 @ $4000 • $85 @ $4300 • $95 @ $4600 • $110 @ $5000 Gold going up? Barrick prints money. Gold going sideways? Barrick prints money. Gold going down? Barrick STILL prints money because Fourmile is basically a money-spitting dragon. ⸻ 📈 NOW THE JUICY PART Starting valuation: $55/share at $4000 gold Every +100 in gold price = +$3.5/share Current gold price in your note? $4200 gold. That means: • $55 base • +$10 from Mali • +$7 from the gold price difference 🔥 = $72/share conservative value right now 🔥 Market currently pricing Barrick like it’s a grandma with a metal detector, not a global gold emperor with the best mine in Nevada. ⸻ 🚀 TL;DR FOR THE ADHD AUTISTS • S&P inclusion = forced buying • Fourmile mine = god-tier print factory • Mali drama resolved • Analysts already behind the curve • Gold trending up • Barrick undervalued harder than Bitcoin at $200 Target: $72 short-term. $110+ if gold hits $5k. ⸻ 🦍💎 FINAL THOUGHTS 💎🦍 This isn’t a meme stock. This is the anti-meme stock. This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman. This is free money with a shovel. The WSB play isn’t to YOLO weeklies — it’s to buy, hold, and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion. GOLD TO THE MOON. BARRICK TO VALHALLA. I am not a financial advisor. I am, however, extremely bullish and slightly intoxicated. Positions Below ya regards, screenshot for proof 35C january 2027 40C january 2027",

      "selftext": "# RGTI Insiders still selling Latest sells were on 21-Nov by CFO and CTO. CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $12/share [openinsider]( And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue, what are insiders doing? Still selling. The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company. Zero. Some people defend this by saying he has stock options, but that is not the same as owning the stock. For a company this young and unproven, a leader should have skin in the game. The people running this company are cashing out, not buying in. The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits. # $1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $12-$15 range is the right play, and the latest 10-Q report proves my point. I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025, and the business is actually getting worse. Their revenue for the last nine months was only $5.2 million. That is a massive drop from the $8.5 million they made in the same period last year. A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag. So how are they staying alive? By printing a ridiculous number of new shares. They burned through over $41 million in cash in just nine months. To cover that, they sold nearly $347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering. They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself cannot generate enough cash. This is not a sign of a healthy company; it is a sign of continuing desperation. # Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Here's RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025: [ ..and Mckinsey & Co.: position 250 RGTZ - (inverse w/ 2x leverage)",

CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $ 12share openinsider And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue what are insiders doing Still selling . The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company . Zero . Some people defend this by saying he has stock options but that is not_the same as owning the stock . For a company this young and unproven a leader should have skin in the game . The people running this company are cashing out not_buying in . The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits . $ 1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $ 8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $ 12 $ 15 range is the right play and the latest 10Q report proves my point . I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025 and the business is actually getting worse . Their revenue for the last nine months was only $ 5.2 million . That is a massive drop from the $ 8.5 million they made in the same period last year . A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag . So how are they staying alive By printing a ridiculous number of new shares . They burned through over $ 41 million in cash in just nine months . To cover that they sold nearly $ 347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering . They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself can not generate enough cash . This is not_a sign of a healthy company it is a sign of continuing desperation . Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Heres RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025 .. and Mckinsey Co. position 250 RGTZ inverse w 2x leverage"

      "selftext": "No paywall: [ NVIDIA and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS) today announced an expanded, strategic partnership to revolutionize design and engineering across industries. R&D teams, from the semiconductor industry to aerospace, automotive, industrial and beyond, face significant engineering challenges including increasing workflow complexity, escalating development costs and time-to-market pressure. This expanded partnership will integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’ market-leading engineering solutions to deliver capabilities enabling R&D teams to design, simulate and verify intelligent products with greater precision, speed and at lower cost. In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. “CUDA GPU-accelerated computing is revolutionizing design — enabling simulation at unprecedented speed and scale, from atoms to transistors, from chips to complete systems, creating fully functional digital twins inside the computer,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design — empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future.” “The complexity and cost of developing next-generation intelligent systems demands engineering solutions with a deeper integration of electronics and physics, accelerated by AI capabilities and compute. No two companies are better positioned to deliver AI-powered, holistic system design solutions than Synopsys and NVIDIA,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. “Together we will re-engineer engineering and empower innovators everywhere to more efficiently realize their innovations.” **Joint Development to Enable Future of Engineering on Accelerated Computing** The multiyear partnership builds on strong, existing technology collaborations between the companies and includes the following initiatives: * **Broadly accelerate Synopsys applications:** Using NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries and AI physics technologies, Synopsys will further accelerate and optimize its broad portfolio of compute-intensive applications spanning chip design, physical verification, molecular simulations, electromagnetic analysis, optical simulation and more. * ​**Advance agentic AI engineering:** Building on the existing AI collaboration to enable agentic AI workflows, the companies are integrating Synopsys AgentEngineer™ technology with the NVIDIA agentic AI technology stack — including NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, NVIDIA NeMo™ Agent Toolkit software and NVIDIA Nemotron™ models — to enable autonomous design capabilities for electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation and analysis workflows. * ​**Connect the physical and digital worlds through digital twins:** The companies will collaborate to enable the next generation of virtual design, testing and validation through the use of highly accurate and sophisticated digital twins for industries such as semiconductor, robotics, aerospace, automotive, energy, industrial, healthcare and beyond. These solutions will utilize NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and other technologies. * ​**Cloud-ready solutions:** Synopsys and NVIDIA plan to make the power of accelerated engineering solutions accessible to engineering teams of all sizes by enabling cloud access for GPU-accelerated engineering solutions. * ​**Develop joint go-to-market initiatives:** To drive market adoption, the companies also have agreed to develop joint go-to-market initiatives to broadly reach engineering teams across multiple industries with both on-premise and cloud-ready solutions. This go-to-market effort will utilize Synopsys’ global network of thousands of direct sellers and channel partners, building on Synopsys’ broad customer base and existing agreement to license, sell and support Omniverse technology embedded in Synopsys simulation solutions. This partnership is not exclusive. NVIDIA and Synopsys continue to partner with the broader semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) ecosystem to create shared growth opportunities for the future of engineering and design.",

      "selftext": "I am writing this on my phone. So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes. What IOVA does? Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors. (Roughly over 90%, remaining 10% being Blood) Their product, Amtagvi (lifileucel), is a one-time TIL therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Doctors take T cells from the tumor, Iovance expands them into billions, and those cells get infused back into the patient. Very intuitive, essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer. Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real, durable responses. This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers. Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works. I hold 30,000 shares. 2) Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths. You may have heard of CAR-T but that doesn’t work on them. They only work for blood cancer which is only 10% of TAM, rest being Soldin tumor cancer. Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment, and 2L severely lacking treatment. If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers, the market is massive. Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD. Add cervical, NSCLC, head and neck, ovarian: the upside gets wide quickly. In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications, with several already in late stage phase 3. The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat. And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area. With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment. NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space. No other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is. They have their own manufacturing facilities that’s worth 1 billion USD itself. 3) Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid-2024. Early numbers: • Q2: around $31M • Q3: around $62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter. 70+ treatment centers active or onboarding. Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250-300M range. And management has reiterated their range for EOY. For a ~$1B market cap company, that’s extremely low valuation. 3) Bear Case arguments that don’t hold water Execution: With IOVA bears and shorts never questioned the science but about the execution. I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible. However, they bought in a new CFO (Corleen Roche) in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40% in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption: This was another pain point, during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA. Since, it is a Novel treatment. Patient referrals by Doctors was slow, and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process. In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson (The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies). The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff. Q4 will be explosive. Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write: 1. Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast. If they keep beating, the market re-rates this quickly. Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target. Q4 will be huge for this stock 2. New indications Cervical cancer filing potential. NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval First-line melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3. 3. Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway. (UK is already approved but not announced) Canada already approved. 4. Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time = more patients = more revenue. 5. Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable, any major pharma would want this platform. 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy Long-Term Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors, this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers. The total addressable market becomes enormous. At least $30B and at current share prices that’s $75 per share. Even if you are super bear about this stock at $10 minimum is already better than its current price. Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock. First-in-class advantage, strong early sales, a huge melanoma market, and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers. If they execute, this isn’t a 5 percent upside story. It’s potentially several multiples. This is why I’m long 30K shares. Risks Not sugarcoated: • Manufacturing is complex. • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong. Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail. But highly unlikely given its recent data release. It’s incredible • Volatility is brutal. Shorts have been at this stock with about 35% shorted. However, about 80-90% is owned by Institutions. Big names like Blackrock, GS , etc.. • They’ve diluted before and might again if sales don’t scale fast enough. But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don’t buy this thinking it’s a safe biotech. You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks. And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy, real revenue, growing adoption, a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers, and a valuation priced like it’s dead. I’m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science, the market, and the timing actually line up. If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts, this has legitimate multi-bagger potential. Q4 will be turning point. Get in before the stock rips. It will create generational wealth. If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn’t complete vapor, this is one of the few worth watching.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am writing this on my phone . So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes . What IOVA does Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors . Roughly over 90 % remaining 10 % being Blood Their product Amtagvi lifileucel is a onetime TIL therapy tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes . Doctors take T cells from the tumor Iovance expands them into billions and those cells get infused back into the patient . Very intuitive essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer . Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real durable responses . This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers . Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works . I hold 30000 shares . 2 Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths . You may have heard of CART but that doesn ’ t work on them . They only work for blood cancer which is only 10 % of TAM rest being Soldin tumor cancer . Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment and 2L severely lacking treatment . If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers the market is massive . Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD . Add cervical NSCLC head and neck ovarian the upside gets wide quickly . In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications with several already in late stage phase 3 . The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat . And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area . With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment . NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space . No_other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is . They have their own manufacturing facilities that ’ s worth 1 billion USD itself . 3 Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid2024 . Early numbers • Q2 around $ 31M • Q3 around $ 62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter . 70 treatment centers active or onboarding . Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250300M range . And management has reiterated their range for EOY . For a $ 1B market cap company that ’ s extremely low valuation . 3 Bear Case arguments that don ’ t hold water Execution With IOVA bears and shorts never_questioned the science but about the execution . I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible . However they bought in a new CFO Corleen Roche in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40 % in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption This was another pain point during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA . Since it is a Novel treatment . Patient referrals by Doctors was slow and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process . In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies . The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff . Q4 will be explosive . Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write 1 . Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast . If they keep beating the market rerates this quickly . Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target . Q4 will be huge for this stock 2 . New indications Cervical cancer filing potential . NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval Firstline melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3 . 3 . Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway . UK is already approved but not_announced Canada already approved . 4 . Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time more patients more revenue . 5 . Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable any major pharma would want this platform . 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy LongTerm Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers . The total addressable market becomes enormous . At least $ 30B and at current share prices that ’ s $ 75 per share . Even if you are super bear about this stock at $ 10 minimum is already better than its current price . Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock . Firstinclass advantage strong early sales a huge melanoma market and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers . If they execute this isn ’ t a 5 percent upside story . It ’ s potentially several multiples . This is why I ’ m long 30K shares . Risks Not_sugarcoated • Manufacturing is complex . • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong . Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail . But highly unlikely given its recent data release . It ’ s incredible • Volatility is brutal . Shorts have been at this stock with about 35 % shorted . However about 8090 % is owned by Institutions . Big names like Blackrock GS etc .. • They ’ ve diluted before and might again if sales don ’ t scale fast enough . But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don ’ t buy this thinking it ’ s a safe biotech . You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks . And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy real revenue growing adoption a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers and a valuation priced like it ’ s dead . I ’ m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science the market and the timing actually line up . If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts this has legitimate multibagger potential . Q4 will be turning point . Get in before the stock rips . It will create generational wealth . If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn ’ t complete vapor this is one of the few worth watching ."

      "title": "Why Some Commercial Biotech Companies Get Valued on Trailing Revenue Instead of Forward Expectations",
      "selftext": "Over the past year I’ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercial-stage biotech companies. Unlike most sectors, which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue, early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter. This creates situations where companies with FDA approval, real product sales, and multi-year cash runways still get priced as if nothing meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two. One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer’s drug called Zunveyl into long-term care earlier this year. They reported a little over $2.6 million in product revenue last quarter, and early adoption from facilities has been steady, but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering, solid QoQ growth. It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech. Is this caution justified, or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase? [](",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past year I ’ ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercialstage biotech companies . Unlike most sectors which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter . This creates situations where companies with FDA approval real product sales and multiyear cash runways still get priced as if nothing_meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two . One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer ’ s drug called Zunveyl into longterm care earlier this year . They reported a little over $ 2.6 million in product revenue last quarter and early adoption from facilities has been steady but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering solid QoQ growth . It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech where the shift from a “ pipeline story ” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quartertoquarter noise . In most other industries companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter so I ’ m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech . Is this caution justified or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase"
