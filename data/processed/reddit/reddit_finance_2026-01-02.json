      "selftext": "Not one strategist predicts a poor year for the S&P 500 in a large survey of major broker estimates compiled by Bloomberg. CFRA’s strategists, cited by TKer by Sam Ro, offer advice for 2026. Remain invested but vigilant, focusing on higher quality growth companies. “Nvidia is the only company that meets almost all of the assumptions in that bullish outlook, such as earnings growth, AI spending, high valuations, and the market’s top-heavy leadership.” A consensus bullish call usually boils down to a few things on which analysts agree: Earnings will grow fast enough to justify prices. Interest rates won’t make things worse financially like they may when inflation rises. AI expenditure is not only intriguing, it is also strong. The market’s leaders, who are still mostly big IT companies, won’t break. Why Nvidia is the perfect “anchor stock” for 2026 1. AI capex proxy. Nvidia is usually the company that gets the most money when big corporations buy AI infrastructure. 2. Stress test for valuation. Prices go up quickly when expectations are high. That makes the stock (and frequently the whole sector) more sensitive to surprises. 3. Check the breadth. If a small group of leaders conducts most of the work, Nvidia’s strength can hide weakness in other areas. The disguise falls off quickly if Nvidia fails.",

The market ’ s leaders who are still mostly big IT companies won ’ t break . Why Nvidia is the perfect “ anchor stock ” for 2026 1 . AI capex proxy . Nvidia is usually the company that gets the most money when big corporations buy AI infrastructure . 2 . Stress test for valuation . Prices go up quickly when expectations are high . That makes the stock and frequently the whole sector more sensitive to surprises . 3 . Check the breadth .

      "selftext": "I genuinely love Public’s user friendly interface, and all I currently want is on there. Stocks, ETF’s, indexes, IRA, Bonds, this is all I’m currently looking at. Granted, I am newer (I’ve been dabbling here and there but decided to actually take my finances into my own hands) so I don’t know if there’s something else I may be interested in later. I have (or had) a Fidelity account a while ago just never invested anything in it. I ask this because I’ve seen many from this forum say their bond account isn’t really trust worthy. Also, unless I read wrong I believe they only have up to $50,000 in securities insured, which is something I’m not a fan of. I had planned to put $200/week into my account for investing so I’d get to that point in a few years. I want to make sure I’m covered, does anyone have experience with that? Am I safe or just transfer it over to Fidelity? Can I just move my securities over to Fidelity from Public or would I have to cash out? Thanks!",

I don’t understand why that is? Interest rates are coming down, and it seems like we’re starting to see liquidity injections. Geopolitically the world is improving and a little more stable. Meanwhile beginning of 2025, there was so much uncertainty and tariffs and yet we still saw a rally. Can someone explain to me why the market is risk off NOW with the current circumstances?",

Meanwhile beginning of 2025 there was so much uncertainty and tariffs and yet we still saw a rally . Can someone explain to me why the market is risk off NOW with the current circumstances"

I don't have much help during the day so I was thinking it would be great if I could write for a financial blog at night. 1- Do you have any ideas on good financial blogs I could write for? 2- For the above, do you know any that typically take freelance writers? I do have quite a bit of experience (almost 20 years) and what I think is a good resume. This is an idea I had that would allow me to stay on top of the markets without having to go to a traditional 9-5. I was thinking maybe an article or 2 a month (or more). Thanks for any and all insights.",

In layman's term, they will be the only refiner in north america to produce battery grade cobalt. Very important for lithium-ion batteries as this is a core material in those types of batteries. They plan to finish construction some time in 2027 hopefully and their biggest customer seems to be LG so thats a positive look. They also had a recent debt restructuring which helped reduce their debt I believe. If you have any important or relevant information please share, as I am trying to learn more about this stock. It feels like it has a good future but it just needs to be able to execute first.",

In laymans term they will be the only refiner in north america to produce battery grade cobalt . Very important for lithiumion batteries as this is a core material in those types of batteries . They plan to finish construction some time in 2027 hopefully and their biggest customer seems to be LG so thats a positive look . They also had a recent debt restructuring which helped reduce their debt I believe . If you have any important or relevant information please share as I am trying to learn more about this stock . It feels like it has a good future but it just needs to be able to execute first ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to pose this question. ​I’m 22 years old and currently have about $28,000 in a Roth IRA managed by Edward Jones. After realizing I’m paying ~1.5% in annual fees to lag the market, I’ve decided to pull the trigger and consolidate everything to Fidelity to self-manage. ​ ​The Proposed Portfolio (Fidelity Funds): ​I’m planning a 60/20/20 split: -​60% FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index): My core US foundation. -​20% FTIHX (Fidelity Total International Index): For global diversification/safety net. -​20% FSPGX (Fidelity Large Cap Growth Index): My \"tilt\" to overweight big tech/growth for the next 10-15 years. ​My Rationale: -​FSKAX gets me the whole US market. -​FTIHX at 20% feels like enough international exposure to avoid being 100% US, without dragging down returns too much if the US continues to outperform. -​FSPGX is my \"aggressive\" bet. I know it overlaps with FSKAX, but I want to double down on growth/tech while I’m 22. ​My Questions for you: -​Is the 20% tilt to FSPGX overkill given that FSKAX is already tech-heavy? -​Is 20% International (FTIHX) a good middle ground? I see some people say 0% and others say 40% (market weight). I’m trying to find the sweet spot for maximum growth. -​Are there any specific \"gotchas\" or better fund equivalents at Fidelity I should be using instead (e.g., FZROX vs FSKAX)? ​Thanks in advance for the feedback!",

But if you are strongly convicted in a stock, that just feels like diluting the gains, when you could have just gone all out one the single stocks. But then again you could end up like intel stock guy. But then again you could end up like nvidia stock guy. How do you solve this dilemma? i mean it is a gamble at the end of the day, regardless of how strongly you feel about a stock, but at same time, taking this gamble feels worth it because if it does work it means you just fast-forwarded a few years and got bigger rewards, but then i guess if it fails you''ve gone backwards in time a few years but honestly this is a lot of buts in decision making. Or you could just not get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds. in short, seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy, like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 1-3 blue chip stocks",

But then again you could end up like intel stock guy . But then again you could end up like nvidia stock guy . How do you solve this dilemma i mean it is a gamble at the end of the day regardless of how strongly you feel about a stock but at same time taking this gamble feels worth it because if it does work it means you just fastforwarded a few years and got bigger rewards but then i guess if it fails youve gone backwards in time a few years but honestly this is a lot of buts in decision making . Or you could just not_get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds . in short seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 13 blue chip stocks"

      "selftext": "This probably isn't your typical penny stock. Because it's actually a deep value-play. And it probably won't be a quick mover either...unless it gets acquired (which I believe it will)....but more on that later. What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry. Vitamins/supplements/nutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future. An aging population and a friendly administration to non-pharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead. The company currently trades at a $9.6m market cap. They have $4.7m in cash and 0 debt, giving us an enterprise value of $4.9m. Fiscal 2025 revenue (ending June 30th) was $54.3m, compared to $50.3m in the year ago period. Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here, but on aggregate this is a growing business. **The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue. That's undervalued clue #1** The company has trailing 12-month EBITDA of $2m. On an **EV/EBITDA basis this is 2.4x. That's undervalued clue #2** Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt. The company's inventory is $10.5m, which is more than the current market cap of the company. **Simply put, they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for. That's undervalued clue #3** The hidden value here is really in their real estate. They only have their entire property & equipment valued at $1.8m. This is despite owning a 40,000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate. Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $8-10m range. **The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what it's actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company. That's undervalued clue #4** Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet. The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value. **Simply put, the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for, without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business. That's undervalued clue #5.** I've always tried to align myself with people smarter than me. And the fact that the stock is 40% owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign. The DeSantis family, thru CDS holdings, control just over 13m shares, or about 43% of the stock. Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP. William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP, and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius. It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values. I'm sure they're looking at the same numbers I'm looking at, and realize the company's assets are probably worth around $1/share (current share price is in the low $0.30s). And that's valuing the company's profitable operations at $0. We're just talking assets here. **Risks:** As with most penny stocks, things are never going to be perfect. You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward. The main risk here is with customer concentration. The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for, Life Extension and Herbalife. Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue, and Herbalife is around 25%. These are multi-decade relationships so I'd weight the probability of losing these customers as low, but it's still a risk. INBP has been in business for over 50 years, so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry. **Conclusion**: It's not often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value. And not just a little below, INBP is 50% below net asset value. And probably more like 70% below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate. There's a lot of margin for error here, and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires. I think it's a matter of when, and not if, the company is acquired. Disclosure: Long",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably isnt your typical penny stock . Because its actually a deep valueplay . And it probably wont be a quick mover either ... unless it gets acquired which I believe it will .... but more on that later . What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry . Vitaminssupplementsnutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future . An aging population and a friendly administration to nonpharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead . The company currently trades at a $ 9.6m market cap . They have $ 4.7m in cash and 0 debt giving us an enterprise value of $ 4.9m . Fiscal 2025 revenue ending June 30th was $ 54.3m compared to $ 50.3m in the year ago period . Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here but on aggregate this is a growing business . The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue . Thats undervalued clue 1 The company has trailing 12month EBITDA of $ 2m . On an EVEBITDA basis this is 2.4x . Thats undervalued clue 2 Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt . The companys inventory is $ 10.5m which is more than the current market cap of the company . Simply put they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for . Thats undervalued clue 3 The hidden value here is really in their real estate . They only have their entire property equipment valued at $ 1.8m . This is despite owning a 40000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate . Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $ 810m range . The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what its actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company . Thats undervalued clue 4 Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet . The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value . Simply put the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business . Thats undervalued clue 5 . Ive always tried to align myself with people smarter than me . And the fact that the stock is 40 % owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign . The DeSantis family thru CDS holdings control just over 13m shares or about 43 % of the stock . Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP . William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius . It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values . Im sure theyre looking at the same numbers Im looking at and realize the companys assets are probably worth around $ 1share current share price is in the low $ 0.30s . And thats valuing the companys profitable operations at $ 0 . Were just talking assets here . Risks As with most penny stocks things are never_going to be perfect . You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward . The main risk here is with customer concentration . The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for Life Extension and Herbalife . Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue and Herbalife is around 25 % . These are multidecade relationships so Id weight the probability of losing these customers as low but its still a risk . INBP has been in business for over 50 years so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry . Conclusion Its not_often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value . And not_just a little below INBP is 50 % below net asset value . And probably more like 70 % below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate . Theres a lot of margin for error here and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires . I think its a matter of when and not_if the company is acquired . Disclosure Long"

      "selftext": "With CES 2026 happening next week I thought it would be a good time to discuss what people’s favourite robotic stocks are. Typically during the CES event there is a lot of hype around robotics and some of the largest companies discuss and show off the latest and upcoming developments in the robotics industry. My personal favourites right now are RR (Richtech Robotics) and SERV (Serve Robotics). Richtech will be showing off their latest robots at CES next week. They have a wide range of robots that will service various sectors and have partnerships with Nvidia. Serve robotics is mainly focused on food delivery but have deals already with major food delivery companies. What are your favourites and how do you think the robotics sector will do this year? There seems to be growing hype around Robotics recently and the change it can have in various sectors.",

      "selftext": "Thoughts on agency MREITs with 12-20% yield like AGNC, NLY, DX, ORC, TWO, ARR etc., (and mortgage companies like RKT, LDI, UWMC.) My basic thesis is below but I’d like outside opinions since every friend I have from working in the mortgage industry has no opinions. Please tell me where I am wrong. Mortgages companies and Mortgage REITS (probably the best risk adjusted value niche in the market) • ⁠It affects so many people (and therefore our justifiably unpopular president’s popularity leading into midterms) and is driven by policy and regulation that the executive branch largely has control over. Trump has more • ⁠Mortgage spreads are historically wide when corporate spreads (ex ORCL) are tight • ⁠Deregulation for mortgages and banking • ⁠Lower Capital requirements means more lending • ⁠Funding/repo rates are gonna drop more with the federal • ⁠LT rates anchored with largest treasury buybacks of all time • ⁠MREITs yield 12-20% dividends so when rates fall and will look even more attractive on a relative basis. Meanwhile their higher net interest spread will make them more profitable and they should continue to appreciate. • ⁠Financial/Mortgage companies are full of paper pushers who do countless repetitive tasks whose jobs are the most easily replaced with AI. No edge AI sensors or insane computational energy needed for how straightforward these are. Headcount expense can plummet. Outside catalyst bet: - Declaring housing an emergency, Trump can order his new lackey at the fed is to start to buy mortgage bonds in some form of QE tightening spreads. Potential Risk - People may not want to move cuz of their mortgage rates and material costs can rise with the inevitable “run it hot” inflation. Also, K shaped economy and labor weakness.",

      "selftext": "If you are looking for a stock that could be a ten bagger, I would recommend you consider Symbotic (SYM). This is highly speculative, and the prices assumes substantial growth, but the sky is the limit for this one. To quote its business summary: “Symbotic Inc., an automation technology company, develops technologies to enhance operating efficiencies in modern warehouses. The company automates the processing of pallets, cases, and individual items in warehouses. Its systems enhance operations at the front end of the supply chain.” I strongly recommend you looks the video at their website to understand what they do. I love their products! But, the thing I like even more is their customer list. It may be short but it is growing and the additions are trend setters that you have to respect. The list includes: Walmart Target Albertsons They have a joint venture with SoftBank which is called GreenBox. This provides warehouse automation as a service; therefore, the customer does not have to incur upfront costs. They recently picked up Medline as a client. Medline has connections with Blackstone, Carlyle Group, and Hillman &Friedman. This has the product and connections to go through the roof! This is not a recommendation, draw your own conclusions.",

      "selftext": "I’m curious how other investors handle this. When a company does an earnings call, management usually makes a lot of statements about what they plan to do over the next quarters or year.

However, from a portfolio allocation standpoint, if the smartest investors such as Berkshire Hathaway are keeping a lot of cash for a downturn, why shouldn’t retail investors hold a bigger cash position now? See below article on Berkshire I am NOT talking about silly things such as selling all stocks or YOLOing into a meme stock, but tactically increasing cash allocation for 3-6 months after S&P 500 has gone up almost 80% cumulatively in the last three years. Specially if you have new money now, would you invest all at once into S&P index at the current valuation or keep more cash position? Edit: clarified that I am not debating VOO and chill approach, which I think is the right strategy for most.

I thought Venmo would help but it just seems like this company is lost and has no real prospects to turn it around in 2026.

Plus I didnt need the losses in 2025 . I did finally give up on PayPal after about 5 years of DCAs in on the stock . I thought Venmo would help but it just seems like this company is lost and has no_real prospects to turn it around in 2026 . Also if you sold did you wait until November December or did you decide earlier in the year"

      "selftext": "Happy New Year, everyone. After the frenzy of 2025 subsided, 2026 feels entirely different now. The once dominant Mag7 companies have begun to diverge. The market no longer buys into so called AI potential; instead, it focuses on who can actually deliver cash flow from AI monetization. These are the three stocks I'm focusing on in 2026: 1. GOOG: I know many find Google boring. But with Gemini 3.0's deep integration and Google Cloud's growth outpacing peers, they've proven the skeptics wrong. Their AI Agent monetization within Workspace will be this year's big surprise. Crucially, compared to Microsoft or Nvidia, Google remains relatively “cheaply” valued. 2. VRT: If 2024-2025 was the year of chips, then 2026 is the year of power grids. Every data center built today requires top tier cooling and power management, and Vertiv is the undisputed leader in this space. As long as tech giants keep pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure, VRT will keep raking in profits. This is a classic “shovel business” no matter which AI model wins, they'll need its liquid cooling tech. 3. VRTX: Their cystic fibrosis drug faces virtually no competition, and their CRISPR gene editing pipeline is entering harvest mode. In years of heightened tech stock volatility, growth stocks like VRTX with deep moats and resilience to economic cycles can significantly stabilize portfolios. My current strategy is to steer clear of pure hardware hype and focus on companies controlling infrastructure or vertical applications with exceptionally high margins. Which investments do you see as valuable by 2026? This article is for informational purposes only. Invest with caution!",

      "selftext_processed": "Happy New Year everyone . After the frenzy of 2025 subsided 2026 feels entirely different now . The once dominant Mag7 companies have begun to diverge . The market no_longer buys into so called AI potential instead it focuses on who can actually deliver cash flow from AI monetization . These are the three stocks Im focusing on in 2026 1 . GOOG I know many find Google boring . But with Gemini 3.0s deep integration and Google Clouds growth outpacing peers theyve proven the skeptics wrong . Their AI Agent monetization within Workspace will be this years big surprise . Crucially compared to Microsoft or Nvidia Google remains relatively “ cheaply ” valued . 2 . VRT If 20242025 was the year of chips then 2026 is the year of power grids . Every data center built today requires top tier cooling and power management and Vertiv is the undisputed leader in this space . As long as tech giants keep pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure VRT will keep raking in profits . This is a classic “ shovel business ” no_matter which AI model wins theyll need its liquid cooling tech . 3 . VRTX Their cystic fibrosis drug faces virtually no_competition and their CRISPR gene editing pipeline is entering harvest mode . In years of heightened tech stock volatility growth stocks like VRTX with deep moats and resilience to economic cycles can significantly stabilize portfolios . My current strategy is to steer clear of pure hardware hype and focus on companies controlling infrastructure or vertical applications with exceptionally high margins . Which investments do you see as valuable by 2026 This article is for informational purposes only . Invest with caution"

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing, and with a background in geopolitics, I decided to go pretty hard (\\~25% of my portfolio) on MPC, the largest oil refinery in the US, about a month ago. Sorta bought the peak. The logic was as follows: MPC is the largest petroleum refiner in the US. By that point it was up \\~25% YTD. 293% 5 years. Generally speaking, oil is a finite resource, and even if the world switches to renewable energy, petroleum-related products are going to remain mandatory. (asphalt, bitumen etc). As for MPC specifically, I thought it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the geopolitical situations unfolding. First of all, many of its refineries are located on the Gulf Coast, primed to receive Venezuelan crude. In fact, they were built *specifically for it*. They are the best suited refiner for sour, heavy crude, which is the vast majority of what Venezuela has. Secondly, they're the only refiner that's expanding its factories to accommodate more volume. And lastly, they've been regularly and consistently buying back shares, suggesting high confidence in the business from the company side. Geopolitically speaking, I figured MPC should benefit from the conflict no matter how it ends. When Venezuela concedes and the US gains access to VE crude, MPC wins the most because it can import raw materials at premium prices. And it **will** end that way, based on the fact that Maduro has **already** offered the US premium access to its oil reserves, and Trump has refused. This means that the only question is **how** preferential US access will be to VE crude, not whether or not it will obtain it. The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation, right? Source: [ That being said, I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down, over speculations of oversupply. But MPC is a *buyer* of oil, not a seller. The core products of MPC, like Diesel and distillates, are seeing the exact opposite. There's a supply *squeeze* in the US, not a glut. All that being said, if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute, could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month?

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys Im relatively new to investing and with a background in geopolitics I decided to go pretty hard 25 % of my portfolio on MPC the largest oil refinery in the US about a month ago . Sorta bought the peak . The logic was as follows MPC is the largest petroleum refiner in the US . By that point it was up 25 % YTD . 293 % 5 years . Generally speaking oil is a finite resource and even if the world switches to renewable energy petroleumrelated products are going to remain mandatory . asphalt bitumen etc . As for MPC specifically I thought it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the geopolitical situations unfolding . First of all many of its refineries are located on the Gulf Coast primed to receive Venezuelan crude . In fact they were built specifically for it . They are the best suited refiner for sour heavy crude which is the vast majority of what Venezuela has . Secondly theyre the only refiner thats expanding its factories to accommodate more volume . And lastly theyve been regularly and consistently buying back shares suggesting high confidence in the business from the company side . Geopolitically speaking I figured MPC should benefit from the conflict no_matter how it ends . When Venezuela concedes and the US gains access to VE crude MPC wins the most because it can import raw materials at premium prices . And it will end that way based on the fact that Maduro has already offered the US premium access to its oil reserves and Trump has refused . This means that the only question is how preferential US access will be to VE crude not_whether or not_it will obtain it . The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation right Source That being said I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down over speculations of oversupply . But MPC is a buyer of oil not_a seller . The core products of MPC like Diesel and distillates are seeing the exact opposite . Theres a supply squeeze in the US not_a glut . All that being said if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month And whether it makes sense to attempt to DCA"

      "selftext": "I’m a Canadian DIY investor managing my own portfolio and investing an additional $1,500–$2,000 weekly, mostly into US equities. I’m not looking for a financial advisor. Instead, I’m looking for a paid online service that offers: • Clear buy/sell guidance • Model portfolios • ETF recommendations • Rules‑based or systematic frameworks I’m willing to spend up to ~$1,000/year if the service provides real value. My timeline: • Wife has a ~$70K pension starting in ~5 years • I’m targeting retirement in 6–8 years There are tons of newsletters and advisory platforms out there, but I’m trying to narrow down which ones are actually worth paying for. Which online services do you recommend for someone who wants structured guidance but still wants to stay fully DIY? Thanks in advance for your advice *** I understand that there are no service that are 100% accurate. I have many US stocks and really unsure what to keep, what to sell… I am looking at different services like SeekingAlpha, Morningstar, … but comments / reviews are all over the map. Looking for any advice from you folks that have had some success with similar service ***",

My timeline • Wife has a $ 70K pension starting in 5 years • I ’ m targeting retirement in 6–8 years There are tons of newsletters and advisory platforms out there but I ’ m trying to narrow down which ones are actually worth paying for . Which online services do you recommend for someone who wants structured guidance but still wants to stay fully DIY Thanks in advance for your advice I understand that there are no_service that are 100 % accurate . I have many US stocks and really unsure what to keep what to sell… I am looking at different services like SeekingAlpha Morningstar … but comments reviews are all over the map . Looking for any advice from you folks that have had some success with similar service"

The only thing I remember in my quick search was that there are mainly 2 tipes of investing: 1)The \"Go big or go home\" where you aim for a big turnout but are taking a bigger risk 2)The \"Slow and steady\" where the turnout may be significantly less, but the risk comes down as well. What I'm asking is some tips on about everything I've said, corrections if even the 2 things I've written are wrong as well, recommendations on how or if to start (based on how much I have as well if interested) And lastly, happy new year",

I dont know witch sitesapp to use and so on . The only thing I remember in my quick search was that there are mainly 2 tipes of investing 1The Go big or go home where you aim for a big turnout but are taking a bigger risk 2The Slow and steady where the turnout may be significantly less but the risk comes down as well . What Im asking is some tips on about everything Ive said corrections if even the 2 things Ive written are wrong as well recommendations on how or if to start based on how much I have as well if interested And lastly happy new year"

      "selftext": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams. - do not assume that an offer to \"help\" is legitimate. There are many dozens of types of scams - a list of scam types can be found in r/scams in the master list here: [/r/Scams Common Scam Master]( 1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot]( 2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion. 6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary. Depending on where you live - you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [ You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [ United Kingdom - Financial Conduct Authority - [ \\- a warning list of fake companies can be found here - [ Canada - CIRO - [ For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pump-and-dumps - one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with - you can find the AMA here - [ If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following: 1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to \"recover\" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers. 4. If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer - report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company.",

      "selftext_processed": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading please be aware that social media platform like Reddit Discord etc . can be a vector for scams and fraud . Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious . Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams . do not_assume that an offer to help is legitimate . There are many dozens of types of scams a list of scam types can be found in rscams in the master list here rScams Common Scam Master 1 . Good explanation of pigbuthering here Pig butchering how to spot 2 . Legitimate investment advisors do not_use WhatApp Telegram Discord etc . to provide tips . In the US it is against regulation specifically SEC Rule 17a4 and FINRA Rule 3110 . For example brokers in the US that use social media for support do not_offer investment advice . 3 . It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams . It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else . 4 . Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype . You can sometimes identify if its a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history . Often you will see that the account has posted nothing_related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks . 5 . One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never_engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd . Those are all signs of stock promotion . 6 . Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake . If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser be wary . Depending on where you live you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser . Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered . United States check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority a warning list of fake companies can be found here Canada CIRO For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pumpanddumps one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with you can find the AMA here If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam . Be aware of the following 1 . Do not_send more money . Do not_provide additional banking or credit card information . 2 . It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to recover funds for payment . This is a common followup scam . Law enforcement will never_ask for money . 3 . If a login account was created . The password used is compromised . Change all passwords that are used . The password will be shared and sold to other scammers . 4 . If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company ."

      "title": "Fidelity Managed FidFolios - Real Numbers After ~ 13 Months",
      "selftext": "Hi All, If you ever talked to a Fidelity advisor, one of their products like the FidFolio was probably shoved in your face. They claim it will save you money due to tax loss harvesting, so I put it to the test so you don't have to. Here is my honest review of how it did: Fidelity Managed FidFolios®: U.S. Total Market Index Initial Investment - $50,574.14 made on 11/27/2024. No additonal investment was mode. Current Valve (as of 1/1/26) - $56,718.84 Total tax loss harvesting - $6,933.11 If I had just invested directly into VTI with the same initial investment and reinvested all the dividends, I would actually have $57,740.65 sitting in my account. That is a difference of $1,021.81. However, with tax loss harvesting and considering my tax bracket to be 24% I should have actually saved $1,663.95 in federal taxes alone. So in theory I'm actually ahead by $642.14, which isn't a lot, but the system is working. The higher your tax rate the more this product would benefit you. Two negatives though: 1. I did find kind of annoying is that Fidelity reports my tax savings to be $2,482.05 with a giant asterick. That asterick is the assumption is that I'm in the 35% tax bracket! I find this to be extremly dishonest from Fidelity since they know exactly what my income is. 2. The money is not as liquid as I thought it would be. Actually from what I understand I would have to call Fidelity first to sell the securities within the account into cash before I can transfter it out. I don't mind the few days delay in this type of process, but I would rather do this from the app or website without having to talk to someone on the phone to get access to my money. 3. Fidelity is pushing the FidFolios product VERY HARD. This generally makes me skeptical and raises my guard. Are they making a commission on this? If the product performs better than other investment vehicles, it will sell itself like hot cakes! At the moment this product does seem to perform better than just investing directly into VTI. However, very marginally! Actually, $642.14 is just 1.1% of the overall value. If you consider state income tax burdens and/or have a higher tax rate your results may be more positive. So what do you think - VTI and chill or keep monitoring the FidFolios product?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi All If you ever talked to a Fidelity advisor one of their products like the FidFolio was probably shoved in your face . They claim it will save you money due to tax loss harvesting so I put it to the test so you dont have to . Here is my honest review of how it did Fidelity Managed FidFolios® U.S. Total Market Index Initial Investment $ 50574.14 made on 11272024 . No_additonal investment was mode . Current Valve as of 1126 $ 56718.84 Total tax loss harvesting $ 6933.11 If I had just invested directly into VTI with the same initial investment and reinvested all the dividends I would actually have $ 57740.65 sitting in my account . That is a difference of $ 1021.81 . However with tax loss harvesting and considering my tax bracket to be 24 % I should have actually saved $ 1663.95 in federal taxes alone . So in theory Im actually ahead by $ 642.14 which isnt a lot but the system is working . The higher your tax rate the more this product would benefit you . Two negatives though 1 . I did find kind of annoying is that Fidelity reports my tax savings to be $ 2482.05 with a giant asterick . That asterick is the assumption is that Im in the 35 % tax bracket I find this to be extremly dishonest from Fidelity since they know exactly what my income is . 2 . The money is not_as liquid as I thought it would be . Actually from what I understand I would have to call Fidelity first to sell the securities within the account into cash before I can transfter it out . I dont mind the few days delay in this type of process but I would rather do this from the app or website without having to talk to someone on the phone to get access to my money . 3 . Fidelity is pushing the FidFolios product VERY HARD . This generally makes me skeptical and raises my guard . Are they making a commission on this If the product performs better than other investment vehicles it will sell itself like hot cakes At the moment this product does seem to perform better than just investing directly into VTI . However very marginally Actually $ 642.14 is just 1.1 % of the overall value . If you consider state income tax burdens andor have a higher tax rate your results may be more positive . So what do you think VTI and chill or keep monitoring the FidFolios product"

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |CRSP US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |CRSP US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |CRSP US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |CRSP US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets Index|\\+33.57%| |MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index|\\+32.39%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "Football is the most-watched event in the United States. Over the next month, the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape. Last year, seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games. The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each. Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest. Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada. Up until 2018, Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘enjoy’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game. On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). By doing so, it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Today, thirty-eight states permit sports wagering in their areas. Now, another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray. They are called prediction markets. Over the last year, the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports, politics, business, weather, travel, and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption. The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events, and specifically football. Why does this matter for the investment world? Increasingly, the public uses its money to try to make a profit. Traditionally, the investment world was the domain where that took place. Over the last twenty years, as markets have become digitized, custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices, especially smartphones. Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity. If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options, levered ETFs, levered ETFs on single stocks, and ETFs related to any geography or activity, one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are, at the very least, blurring. The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi. Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products. In October of 2025, Polymarket received a $2 billion investment at a $9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide access to prediction products for institutions. Kalshi, the leader in global prediction markets with a 60% share and annual trading volume of over $50 billion, obtained $300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia, Andreesen-Horwitz, A16z, and Paradigm. Interestingly, one of the best-performing stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood, the online broker. When any entity suddenly finds a one-hundred-million-dollar run-rate business in less than a year, especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues, investors react favorably. As the prediction entities have gained adoption, the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically. More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas, the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6% in 2025 (perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026?) []( [Share](%%share_url%%) Whenever there is a competitive alternative, incumbents will respond to protect their market share. FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association. The following week, both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms (in partnership with the CME Group, the publicly traded futures exchange). Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry. From a regulatory standpoint, the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, it views the product as a financial derivative and not gambling. Anti-fraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘clarify’ the legal boundaries. In Congress, our on-the-ball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members (The ex-madame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember). So how should investors view this whole situation? The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting. However, betting and gambling are different. In gaming, there is a definite outcome, and the only thing one owns is the chance that one’s prediction, wager, hand, throw of the dice, or pull of the machine turns out correctly. When one invests, you own an entity that has assets and liabilities. In most cases, those assets and liabilities form operating businesses. The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity. From my perspective, and I have written this on numerous occasions, my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino. The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges, suppliers of gaming, and some underlying offshoot of both. Yes, Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged. It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and I certainly will be paying attention.",

      "selftext_processed": "Football is the mostwatched event in the United States . Over the next month the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape . Last year seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games . The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each . Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest . Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada . Up until 2018 Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘ enjoy ’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game . On May 14 2018 the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act PASPA . By doing so it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting . Today thirtyeight states permit sports wagering in their areas . Now another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray . They are called prediction markets . Over the last year the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports politics business weather travel and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption . The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events and specifically football . Why does this matter for the investment world Increasingly the public uses its money to try to make a profit . Traditionally the investment world was the domain where that took place . Over the last twenty years as markets have become digitized custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices especially smartphones . Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity . If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options levered ETFs levered ETFs on single stocks and ETFs related to any geography or activity one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are at the very least blurring . The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi . Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products . In October of 2025 Polymarket received a $ 2 billion investment at a $ 9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange ICE to provide access to prediction products for institutions . Kalshi the leader in global prediction markets with a 60 % share and annual trading volume of over $ 50 billion obtained $ 300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia AndreesenHorwitz A16z and Paradigm . Interestingly one of the bestperforming stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood the online broker . When any entity suddenly finds a onehundredmilliondollar runrate business in less than a year especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues investors react favorably . As the prediction entities have gained adoption the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically . More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6 % in 2025 perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026 Share % % share_url % % Whenever there is a competitive alternative incumbents will respond to protect their market share . FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association . The following week both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms in partnership with the CME Group the publicly traded futures exchange . Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry . From a regulatory standpoint the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC . Currently it views the product as a financial derivative and not_gambling . Antifraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘ clarify ’ the legal boundaries . In Congress our ontheball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members The exmadame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember . So how should investors view this whole situation The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting . However betting and gambling are different . In gaming there is a definite outcome and the only thing one owns is the chance that one ’ s prediction wager hand throw of the dice or pull of the machine turns out correctly . When one invests you own an entity that has assets and liabilities . In most cases those assets and liabilities form operating businesses . The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity . From my perspective and I have written this on numerous occasions my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino . The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges suppliers of gaming and some underlying offshoot of both . Yes Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged . It will be interesting to see how this evolves and I certainly will be paying attention ."

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |CRSP US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |CRSP US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |CRSP US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |CRSP US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets Index|\\+33.57%| |MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index|\\+32.39%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

So will the rise continue or not? The next payment is 25k in April. Then the next one is 34k in july and final one is in november Its a matter of selling at the start of the year or waiting if I can make 5-15% free money. Or then it could crash -30% which is the worst case scenario What would you guys do in my position?",

I currently have left to pay 88k and I own 84k in us stocks . I live in Europe . I own sp 500 google visa berkshire hathaway microsoft johnson johnson . The thing is with eur rising to usd any gains with us stocks are almost wiped out . So will the rise continue or not_The next payment is 25k in April . Then the next one is 34k in july and final one is in november Its a matter of selling at the start of the year or waiting if I can make 515 % free money . Or then it could crash 30 % which is the worst case scenario What would you guys do in my position"

      "selftext": "I thought this list was very interesting for 2026 by JPM. Only one of the MAG7 made the list, but AVGO is in the trillion dollar club. I own only 12 of these names with recent additions of SBUX and CRM, expecting big turnarounds next year. Price targets for some of them are a little odd, projecting only very small growth in 2026. For example XOM is already at $120 and the JPM's target is only $124. Really, does this made it a top stock pick? Regardless, this is a pretty diverse list with a bunch of energy and healthcare stocks (which is nice to see). Anyway, would like to hear your thoughts on what you agree or disagree with. The start of a new year is always exciting and a good time for fresh ideas. The top picks, all rated Overweight, with price targets: 1.

I own only 12 of these names with recent additions of SBUX and CRM expecting big turnarounds next year . Price targets for some of them are a little odd projecting only very small growth in 2026 . For example XOM is already at $ 120 and the JPMs target is only $ 124 . Really does this made it a top stock pick Regardless this is a pretty diverse list with a bunch of energy and healthcare stocks which is nice to see . Anyway would like to hear your thoughts on what you agree or disagree with . The start of a new year is always exciting and a good time for fresh ideas .

Scenario: Assume the ability to invest $100,000 annually consistently over the next 10-15 years, with the goal of long-term wealth building while also allowing for some medium-term opportunities. I’ve been reading about a mix of: • long-term compounding assets (equities, funds, etc.) • real estate (residential, multi-unit, or commercial) as a long-game strategy • higher-risk asymmetric assets (e.g., Bitcoin or similar alternatives) as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10+ year horizon, while still allowing for some shorter- to medium-term opportunities. Relevant parameters for context: • Age: early 30s • Location: Southern California, USA (open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida) • Employment: self-employed • Monthly income: \\~$17,000–$20,000 • Debt: none • Liquidity: high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance: moderate-to-high (comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term upside) • Time horizon: primarily 10+ years, with openness to some shorter-term plays alongside long-term compounding",

My last big play of the year was apeing $TSLA calls and some tech puts in November. Seeing how January starts off with most of MSM mega bullish and all of Fintwit expecting a downturn. I think $BIDU continues to go up and planning to go heavy there. I also like $RDW for space and drone theme as a moonshot. My other plays are robotics and software in names like $SYM $TER $PATH & $NOW $CRM. $NKE is due for a run back to $80 and think consumer stocks can bounce more. I also think I will short shares of $PLTR & $HOOD as a hedge. Let me know what plays you’re looking at and wish every one a happy new year and good luck in 2026!! 🙏",

      "selftext": "I just opened my first brokerage account and I'm honestly kinda overwhelmed by all the options out there. For the last couple of years I've been reading (and watching videos) a lot about different investment approaches including stocks, options, futures, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, day trading, buy and hold, swing trading, quantitative, etc. Honestly, it's a lot to take in! I know that am not interested in set it and forget it type approaches. I believe that while historically they have done fine, there's no guarantee that the next bear market won't be -60% and won't last for decades. I really can't gamble with my retirement for a measly 7%-10% a year! Day trading seems too stressful and I have a full-time job so kinda won't work. I tend to like swing trading (from what I have read and watched) and data driven quantitative approaches. For the latter I have seen some hedge funds making a killing, but yet to find any success stories with swing trading. Quant approach seems to require a lot of learning and being good with math and stats (I'm not). Has anyone else been in the same boat as me? What did you do?",

For the last couple of years Ive been reading and watching videos a lot about different investment approaches including stocks options futures fundamental analysis technical analysis day trading buy and hold swing trading quantitative etc . Honestly its a lot to take in I know that am not_interested in set it and forget it type approaches . I believe that while historically they have done fine theres no_guarantee that the next bear market wont be 60 % and wont last for decades . I really cant gamble with my retirement for a measly 7 % 10 % a year Day trading seems too stressful and I have a fulltime job so kinda wont work . I tend to like swing trading from what I have read and watched and data driven quantitative approaches . For the latter I have seen some hedge funds making a killing but yet to find any success stories with swing trading . Quant approach seems to require a lot of learning and being good with math and stats Im not_Has anyone else been in the same boat as me What did you do"

I’m still overweight big cap tech / AI adjacent names, mainly because the fundamentals and cash flow are hard to ignore but I’ve definitely been trimming into strength and sitting on more cash than earlier this year. This week’s price action didn’t really change my mind either. Thin volume, quiet selloff, some metals suddenly ripping, and TSLA guiding a bit lower feels more like rotation + year end positioning than fear. My approach going into 2026 is pretty simple: Core positions in large, profitable tech I’m comfortable holding through volatility Some shorter term trades when setups are clean More cash than usual, waiting for better risk/reward instead of chasing After trading through a few cycles, I’ve learned I don’t need to be “all in” at year end. I’d rather stay flexible and let the market show its hand in Q1. Curious how others here are positioned right now: Still fully invested? I’m intentionally avoiding smaller speculative names right now. I’ve been burned enough times chasing narratives when liquidity dries up.",

      "selftext": "JPMorgan expects the labor market to slow in early 2026, followed by gradual improvement in the latter half of the year. The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies, which have reduced labor supply. Monthly job growth may decline from 50,000 to 15,000 as businesses remain cautious. Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually. I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year, particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology. As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor, automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform. While near-term gains may prove elusive, a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate. What are your thoughts on this?",

Morgan's latest report releases its 2026 “Top Investment Picks.” After reviewing it, I believe these companies must meet the following criteria: Rock-solid finances (strong cash flow, low debt) Pricing power (inflation resistant, stable profits) Bets on major trends (AI, data centers, infrastructure, resilient sectors) Three key themes: AI Boom: Explosive demand for computing power Infrastructure Madness: Grid + Power Revolution Risk Resilient Champions: Top tier performers with robust resilience Top Picks: Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) $385 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) $730 Eli Lilly and Company (LLY) $1,150 (GLP-1 weight loss drug is the real deal) Shocking Price Target: Carvana Inc. (CVNA) projected to hit $490! (???) But I'm curious how this one made the list... A used car platform that plummeted over 80% last year, is J.P. Morgan genuinely bullish or setting a trap to cut the chives? Which stocks are genuine trends? Which are high risk “catching falling knives”? Carvana: Bottom fishing or a pitfall?",

Long-term, I still believe the stock could reach $500 next year, but its recent performance... has been disappointing. Even as the broader market resumed its rally, TSLA failed to follow suit. Therefore, I'm contemplating: Limited upside potential over the next six months Volatility has significantly decreased compared to previous years TSLA currently constitutes an excessive portion of my portfolio, raising concerns from a risk perspective Consequently, I'm considering whether to redirect some capital toward more stable defensive plays like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), or select other low-volatility, dividend-paying stocks to smooth investment fluctuations. This isn't a bearish stance on Tesla itself, but rather a consideration of opportunity cost and concentration risk. Seeking others' perspectives: Would you hold TSLA through this volatility? Reduce exposure while maintaining core holdings? Switch to dividend/defensive stocks? Looking forward to diverse viewpoints, especially from fellow long-term TSLA investors.",

      "selftext": "While the stock market continues to hit all-time highs, the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating. We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a K-shaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living. For the average person, the economy has been in a recession for a year, while the top quintile rides an AI-fueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest over-investment bubble in history. Big Tech is currently pouring over $200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips, yet we are still waiting for a mass-market business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex. And even if there will be a business model, it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising....Just as a side note. The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance. With US national debt crossing $37 trillion, the interest payments alone have breached the $1 trillion mark, now exceeding the entire defense budget. The Fed is trapped in a \"no-win\" scenario: they cannot hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury, but they cannot cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by de-globalization and China’s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse. Simultaneously, the global liquidity taps are being turned off. The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money, and as rates hit the 1% mark, the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets. This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a \"wild\" 2026 bond auction season, taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring. Another hidden fuse (or rather gasoline), however, is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs. We have a massive \"shadow banking\" sector in private credit that hasn't been stress-tested in a high-rate environment. On the other side, when the AI bubble pops, the ETF correlation trap snaps shut. Because passive investing now dominates the market, a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously, driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0. This won't stay confined to the stock market; it will bleed into the housing market. I haven't even touched on the cost of living, US/France/Germany Bond auctions etc. Now my question: Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion? As the Fed is no position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm?",

      "selftext_processed": "While the stock market continues to hit alltime highs the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating . We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a Kshaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living . For the average person the economy has been in a recession for a year while the top quintile rides an AIfueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest overinvestment bubble in history . Big Tech is currently pouring over $ 200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips yet we are still waiting for a massmarket business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex . And even if there will be a business model it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising .... Just as a side note . The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance . With US national debt crossing $ 37 trillion the interest payments alone have breached the $ 1 trillion mark now exceeding the entire defense budget . The Fed is trapped in a nowin scenario they can not hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury but they can not cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by deglobalization and China ’ s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse . Simultaneously the global liquidity taps are being turned off . The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money and as rates hit the 1 % mark the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets . This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a wild 2026 bond auction season taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring . Another hidden fuse or rather gasoline however is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs . We have a massive shadow banking sector in private credit that hasnt been stresstested in a highrate environment . On the other side when the AI bubble pops the ETF correlation trap snaps shut . Because passive investing now dominates the market a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0 . This wont stay confined to the stock market it will bleed into the housing market . I havent even touched on the cost of living USFranceGermany Bond auctions etc . Now my question Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion As the Fed is no_position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm"

      "selftext": "Just yesterday (December 30th), Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) officially launched five new ETFs through its fintech brand \"Truth.Fi\". Although $DJT's stock price fell by 4.5% after the announcement (a typical \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" scenario), the underlying holdings of these funds reveal the current administration's economic strategy for 2026. The \"America First\" Five: TSSD (Security and Defense): Heavily invested in Palantir ($PLTR) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW). This isn't just about tanks and cannons, but rather AI-driven warfare logic. TSFN (Next Frontier): Focused on \"breakthrough\" technologies, appearing to be a high-beta play on domestic innovation. TSIC (American Idols): Investing in blue-chip brands that represent the \"American spirit.\" TSES (Energy Security): This is an interesting mix, including both ExxonMobil ($XOM) and utility stocks like Constellation Energy ($CEG), betting on a \"fracking frenzy\" policy to meet the power demands of AI. TSRS (Red State Real Estate Trust): Specifically targeting real estate in conservative-leaning states. This is a pure play on the trend of population migration inland. Why is this worth paying attention to now? Although the 0.65% management fee is slightly high, the timing is very precise. With the 25% auto tariff and reciprocal trade act set to take full effect in early 2026, these funds aim to capture the benefits of \"manufacturing reshoring.\" Furthermore, with the SEC's changing stance, there are strong calls for the group to launch a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency ETF in early 2026. The core question: Are these funds merely \"political stunts,\" or can they truly generate excess returns by tracking specific sectors supported by the government?",

      "selftext": "Semiconductor stocks were mostly lower to end the 2025 trading year, as investors looked to lock in profits heading into 2026. However, NVDA bucked the trend, posting a modest gain after reports emerged that the company had approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM to increase production of its H200 GPUs, amid a surge in Chinese demand. TSM shares rose 2% on the news. Other semiconductor stocks also declined at the close, including Micron (MU), whose market value has surged this year. Micron's stock fell 1.6% on Wednesday but has risen over 220% due to robust AI demand. Storage companies Seagate Technology (STX), SanDisk (SNDK), and Western Digital (WDC) also saw similar declines on Wednesday. However, like Micron, these three companies have also seen their 2025 valuations surge significantly due to AI investments. Storage and traditional semiconductor companies have significantly outperformed the broader market this year. Do you believe this trend can continue through 2026? Will you continue holding these leading semiconductor stocks, or consider reallocating during short term volatility?",

      "selftext": "Being a 30-something year old with a 30+ year window until retirement, I generally subscribe to the \"VOO and chill\" method for the bulk of my non-qualified long-term investing. I also have a target-dated 401K and some speculative stocks. My income is over the Roth limit so that is not an option. While my target-date fund will continuously rebalance as I approach retirement, what is the best strategy to reduce risk in my (eventually) heavy-weighted VOO portfolio in 20+ years when I am closer to retirement? From what I understand I would either have to realize gains to move funds to a more conservative option (while potentially still being in a high income tax bracket), or simply stop contributing to VOO and invest in more conservative funds to slowly rebalance. Am I missing another strategy?",

I also have a targetdated 401K and some speculative stocks . My income is over the Roth limit so that is not_an option . While my targetdate fund will continuously rebalance as I approach retirement what is the best strategy to reduce risk in my eventually heavyweighted VOO portfolio in 20 years when I am closer to retirement From what I understand I would either have to realize gains to move funds to a more conservative option while potentially still being in a high income tax bracket or simply stop contributing to VOO and invest in more conservative funds to slowly rebalance . Am I missing another strategy"

      "selftext": "China’s demand for Nvidia’s H200 chips reflects both technological dependence and strategic urgency. Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the gold standard for training and deploying large AI models. Their performance, software ecosystem (like CUDA and cuDNN), and integration with global AI frameworks make them hard to replace. China’s domestic alternatives lag behind. While China has made significant investments in chip design (e.g., Huawei’s Ascend, Alibaba’s Hanguang), these chips generally trail Nvidia in raw performance, software support, and developer adoption. U.S. export controls have also cut off access to advanced chip manufacturing tools, making it harder for Chinese firms to catch up quickly. Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent, and ByteDance are racing to develop competitive AI models. Without access to top-tier compute, they risk falling behind US rivals. Chinese firms are scrambling to secure as many Nvidia chips as possible based on uncertainty that U.S. restrictions may tighten again. This behavior signals a lack of domestic substitutes and a fear of future supply shocks.",

      "selftext": "I structured my portfolio with ETFs (VOO, VGT, QQQ) as the core and stocks as a smaller allocation (15–20%). Due to outsized gains in stocks like PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB, the stocks portion has now grown to 50% of the portfolio (stocks total is about $100k). Should I rebalance my portfolio? I sold about 30% of PLTR and RKLB late last year when they grew 6-7x, but since then they have grown another 2-3x (not sure if I should regret though lol). I’m currently considering the following options, but I’m open to other ideas: 1. Rebalance the current % in the table below to the new target % (mostly trimming PLTR, NVDA and RKLB to buy other stocks) 2. Trim PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB but move the money to ETFs 3. Do nothing and continue monthly contributions as usual What's your take? |Stock|Current %|New Target %|Comment| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |PLTR|26.4|19|High growth| |NVDA|22.5|20|High growth| |RKLB|14.2|10|High growth| |GOOGL|14.4|20| | |AMZN|7.5|9| | |AMD|4.5|5| | |TSLA|3.8| |Not a fan anymore| |LUNR|1.8|3|Added 2 months back| |NBIS|1.7|3|Added 2 months back| |ASTS|1.2|3|Added 2 months back| |S|1|2|Added 2 months back| |IONQ|1|1|Added 2 months back| |IREN| |2|New| |VRT| |3|New|",

Ownership and control should confer: \\-cash flow \\-utility \\-productive use \\-enforceable rights If an asset only has value because someone else might buy it later, then returns depend on a greater fool, not ownership.

      "selftext": "The trend lines are rather obvious. At some point, people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships, and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025, the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half (47%) of U.S. households are married couples, a slide from 66% fifty years ago. The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women, and 25% of 40-year-olds have never been married. Currently, 42% of U.S. adults are single, and for many, it isn't a choice; it’s structural isolation. GWI research shows that 80% of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months. Crucially, 31% of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation. The share of Americans who say they have no close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021. One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated. This has created a massive loneliness economy. The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $280 billion by 2032. Within this, the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode. Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8%, projecting the industry to hit $140.7 billion by 2030. In 2023, you could only text these things. In 2025, you could talk to them. By 2027, Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space. This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn’t a flop, it was just early. Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar. These use machine learning to generate photorealistic, real-time representations of humans, capturing subtle eye movements, skin texture, and mouth twitches. The Lex Fridman/Zuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together. Running these used to require a supercomputer, but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA) has significantly reduced compute requirements. By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair, Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4. Combine this with Meta’s absurd amount compute (they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350,000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600,000 H100s) and you have complete vertical integration &nbsp: - **The Brain:** Llama 4 and beyond. - **The Body:** GPiCA Codec Avatars. - **The Hardware:** Quest - **The Memory Software:** Reality Labs &nbsp: By 2030, people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends, All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out. IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit: A lot of people seem to doubt this. I’d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today. People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models. Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable. The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists. Like it or not, Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this",

      "selftext_processed": "The trend lines are rather obvious . At some point people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025 the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half 47 % of U.S. households are married couples a slide from 66 % fifty years ago . The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women and 25 % of 40yearolds have never_been married . Currently 42 % of U.S. adults are single and for many it isnt a choice it ’ s structural isolation . GWI research shows that 80 % of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months . Crucially 31 % of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation . The share of Americans who say they have no_close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021 . One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated . This has created a massive loneliness economy . The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $ 118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $ 280 billion by 2032 . Within this the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode . Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8 % projecting the industry to hit $ 140.7 billion by 2030 . In 2023 you could only text these things . In 2025 you could talk to them . By 2027 Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space . This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn ’ t a flop it was just early . Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar . These use machine learning to generate photorealistic realtime representations of humans capturing subtle eye movements skin texture and mouth twitches . The Lex FridmanZuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together . Running these used to require a supercomputer but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars GPiCA has significantly reduced compute requirements . By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4 . Combine this with Meta ’ s absurd amount compute they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600000 H100s and you have complete vertical integration nbsp The Brain Llama 4 and beyond . The Body GPiCA Codec Avatars . The Hardware Quest The Memory Software Reality Labs nbsp By 2030 people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out . IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit A lot of people seem to doubt this . I ’ d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today . People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models . Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable . The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists . Like it or not_Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this"

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching AppLovin Corporation (APP) closely lately and wanted to get some outside perspectives. APP has been one of the strongest performers in the ad-tech / mobile monetization space, driven largely by its AI powered ad optimization (Axon) and improving margins. Revenue growth has been strong, and the market clearly rewarded that over the past year. That said, at these levels, a few things I’m personally weighing: Valuation is no longer cheap, especially after the recent run-up Growth expectations feel very high going into the next earnings Regulatory and data-privacy headlines still seem like an overhang, even if nothing material has changed recently I’m not bearish on the business more just trying to decide whether this is a hold/add on pullbacks story or if expectations have gotten ahead of fundamentals in the short term. Curious how others here are thinking about APP: Long term compounder? Or a great company that’s priced for perfection right now? Not financial advice genuinely interested in discussion.",

      "selftext": "So, I am trading for years in the stock market, usually using Technical Analysis with some fundamental analysis. Lately I have been paying more attention to insider purchases in order to understand and follow the “smart money”. For example Elliott Hill the CEO of $NKE just disclosed an open market purchase of 16,388 shares at Average price of $61.10 it’s about $1.0M of personal capital. What makes it interesting for me was that about a week earlier two directors were purchasing at the same day. Tim Cook and Robert Holmes Swan, both buying in the high $50s. So I was wondering if do you guys: 1.pay attention to insider buying at all? 2.treat CEO buys differently from directors? 3.is this something use it for confirmation, context, or mostly ignore?",

      "selftext_processed": "So I am trading for years in the stock market usually using Technical Analysis with some fundamental analysis . Lately I have been paying more attention to insider purchases in order to understand and follow the “ smart money ” . For example Elliott Hill the CEO of $ NKE just disclosed an open market purchase of 16388 shares at Average price of $ 61.10 it ’ s about $ 1.0M of personal capital . What makes it interesting for me was that about a week earlier two directors were purchasing at the same day . Tim Cook and Robert Holmes Swan both buying in the high $ 50s . So I was wondering if do you guys 1.pay attention to insider buying at all 2.treat CEO buys differently from directors 3.is this something use it for confirmation context or mostly ignore"

      "selftext": "This story starts around the time when tariff was such a scary word it was moving the market like 5-10% every time Trump would say it. I downloaded Robinhood as any young man thinking that these day trading discords would change my life would, and I got to work. Naturally, I got my ass kicked. Like day in day out I was just losing money. I turned 30k into about 28k. Then something miraculous happened, the market began to pump. I thought I was just making genius trades trading SPY4x Leveraged stock though. I was making a small amount every day and I was happy. Then I got burnt out, I thought it wasn’t for me and just put all my money in my bank account. I then went to Navy bootcamp and the stock market was the least I was worried about. Well it turns out the market was printing, I saw this in August and thought “no way this can keep going.” It proceeded to keep going. I’m not even kidding I started investing on the lowest point the market was at for the whole year, I could of invested in literally anything and got my money back with a 30-40% gain. Instead I thought I was the wolf on Wall Street and tried to time the market and left the year almost perfectly even. This showed me that this time around I’m just maxing out my Roth, putting it in VOO and some other low risk index’s, and forgetting about the money entirely. Never again will I try to beat the market.😔😔",

I downloaded Robinhood as any young man thinking that these day trading discords would change my life would and I got to work . Naturally I got my ass kicked . Like day in day out I was just losing money . I turned 30k into about 28k . Then something miraculous happened the market began to pump . I thought I was just making genius trades trading SPY4x Leveraged stock though . I was making a small amount every day and I was happy . Then I got burnt out I thought it wasn ’ t for me and just put all my money in my bank account . I then went to Navy bootcamp and the stock market was the least I was worried about . Well it turns out the market was printing I saw this in August and thought “ no way this can keep going. ” It proceeded to keep going . I ’ m not_even kidding I started investing on the lowest point the market was at for the whole year I could of invested in literally anything and got my money back with a 3040 % gain . Instead I thought I was the wolf on Wall Street and tried to time the market and left the year almost perfectly even . This showed me that this time around I ’ m just maxing out my Roth putting it in VOO and some other low risk index ’ s and forgetting about the money entirely . Never_again will I try to beat the market.😔😔"

So far, I’ve been researching SOXX for semiconductor exposure and SKYY for cloud computing. I like the idea of using ETFs instead of picking individual tech stocks because of diversification and lower risk compared to betting on one company. I’m looking for more ETFs with similar exposure (AI, data centers, chips, cloud, software, etc.). What other ETFs should I research? Are there things I should be careful about, like fees, concentration risk, or too much overlap between funds?",

      "selftext": "I am a 60 year old UK national in Swizterland temporarly until 2030. I will return to the UK then I was forced to sell my london home in 2024 due to divorce and horrific tenants i couldnt deal with from abroad. I had planned to buy a flat straight away in london but because of supply , demand , price and distance couldnt find anything and at the same time I was earning 1% only from Santander. 18 months have passed. After my divorce, I reconciled all my debts and the result was 500k GBP in the bank . I have no stocks , shares or private pension. I am also suffering from deep depression and anxiety issues. whilst fighting for my rights as a father. I am working part time in a low paid job that covers my rent and health insurance only here. I had companies / marriages which cost me dearly . Now its the end of 2025. I did marginally better by santander which is giving 2.47% interest subject to income tax . I still did not manage to buy a flat. I am getting more and more depressed. Information overload from many sources doesnt help. I am scared of risky investing as j am sure I will be refreshing my screen 99 times away. Dividends and Bank Interest attract tax in Switzerland. There is no tax on capital gains so I am looking for lower risk investment trust that provides capital gains only. I want to invest 400k GBP in something that would attract dividends or interest and just grow for the next 3 years whilst I try to recover For a risk averse , fearful , useless investor would this be be OK . your thoughts please",

      "selftext_processed": "I am a 60 year old UK national in Swizterland temporarly until 2030 . I will return to the UK then I was forced to sell my london home in 2024 due to divorce and horrific tenants i couldnt deal with from abroad . I had planned to buy a flat straight away in london but because of supply demand price and distance couldnt find anything and at the same time I was earning 1 % only from Santander . 18 months have passed . After my divorce I reconciled all my debts and the result was 500k GBP in the bank . I have no_stocks shares or private pension . I am also suffering from deep depression and anxiety issues . whilst fighting for my rights as a father . I am working part time in a low paid job that covers my rent and health insurance only here . I had companies marriages which cost me dearly . Now its the end of 2025 . I did marginally better by santander which is giving 2.47 % interest subject to income tax . I still did not_manage to buy a flat . I am getting more and more depressed . Information overload from many sources doesnt help . I am scared of risky investing as j am sure I will be refreshing my screen 99 times away . Dividends and Bank Interest attract tax in Switzerland . There is no_tax on capital gains so I am looking for lower risk investment trust that provides capital gains only . I want to invest 400k GBP in something that would attract dividends or interest and just grow for the next 3 years whilst I try to recover For a risk averse fearful useless investor would this be be OK . your thoughts please"

A stock goes up by 10% and then the next year that same stock goes up by 8% that gain from the first year is also going up by 8%. But say in a S&S ISA. I invest a certain amount every month and am not looking to sell. Surely because I hadn’t sold, the unrealised profit doesn’t get that compounding because I haven’t reinvested it?? Hopefully that makes sense, but can someone explain that to me because I’m struggling to understand it. Thank you!",

I’ve been pretty optimistic about AI, but I was looking at the data recently and it’s freaking me out. Retail investors are buying in at record highs, but corporate insiders are selling at a 27:1 ratio right now. Why is 'smart money' cashing out so aggressively? Then you look at SoftBank, they are literally selling their winning stocks (Nvidia, T-Mobile) just to scrape together cash to pay OpenAI by the end of the year. It honestly feels like the whole industry is just trying to keep the valuation inflated long enough to IPO OpenAI next year so the VCs can exit. I don’t want to be a fearmonger but does this look like a massive wealth transfer setup to anyone else? Or am I just overthinking it? I know this isn't too different from the whole 'AI bubble' panic but I feel like the timeline seems more concrete now with Google's soon-to-be lead in AI.",

      "selftext": "33m planning to retire at 60. I'm currently making \\~125k/year. With inflation/lifestyle I'm expecting to need \\~200K/year in retirement. * Roth IRA $13,000 in SCHD. I'm contributing the 7K/yr from this point forward. Estimating 5% share price growth rate and 8.5% dividend growth rate. * At 60 this would be worth \\~1.6M with dividends bringing in about \\~125K/yr * at 65 this would be worth \\~2.8M with dividends bringing in about \\~316K/yr * At 70 this would be worth \\~6.2M with dividends bringing in about \\~830K/yr * 401K $160,000 in FXAIX. I'm only contributing up to the employer match. Estimated 8% returns * At 60 this would be worth \\~2-2.5M * \\~240K/yr gets me through about 9 years (including a continued return) * HSA $5,500 in FXAIX. I'm contributing 7,800/yr from this point forward. Estimated 8% returns * At 65 this would be worth \\~1.2M I should have enough money in my 401K to easily get me through \\~7 years. At 67 I should be making somewhere in the ballpark of 450K/year of tax free dividends. I will also still have my HSA growing in the background, unless it's needed for health. I guess what I'm asking is: 1. Is my math mathing? 2. Wouldn't this leave me/my family in an unbelievable position when I inevitably kick the bucket? Just shift to the dividend life at \\~67 and reinvest whatever I don't use. 3. What am I missing? It's late... I have to be missing something.",

I understand RKLB is priced as a high-growth stock as it should be, but it seems as though FOMO and hype surrounding the space industry has risen to an unsustainable level. At 68X sales it looks like RKLB is almost priced for perfection. That being said, RKLB is an amazing company with an incredible opportunity to take significant market share as the 2nd space company in the US behind SpaceX. I know many of you likely got in early and will be holding long term. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on its current valuation relative to where the company is today. No one can predict the future, but do you think $70/share is a fair price to pay? If you had never invested in RKLB, would you now at the current price? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Couer Mining (CDE) closed the day at $18.09 according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext_processed": "Couer Mining CDE closed the day at $ 18.09 according to VectorVest they are valued at 32.5 share . Therefore they are extremely undervalued . Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026 They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD a Canadian mining company . Once this merger goes through they will have 7 operations across North America . They will have the production capability of 900000oz of gold and 20000000oz of silver . They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit . They have had production expansion like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas . Therefore they are still growing . They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year . I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026 . Their debt is mostly longterm and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt . The coupon is fixed . I could not_find the allin sustaining cost but it cost them $ 248m to sell $ 554.6m worth of gold and silver . All their mines are considered to be in safe areas they have 3 in the US 2 in Mexico and 1 explorational site in BC . After the merger they will acquire more sites in Canada . So none of the mines will be politically impacted . They have no_active offering as a matter of fact they have a $ 75 million share buyback program valid through May 31 2026 . Their free cash flow is positive at $ 188M ."

      "selftext": "Hello, stock traders. I thought I'd share an idea with you. On another subreddit I'm on, someone had posted a list of \"low RSI\" stocks he'd screened (less than 30, but >10, to weed out anomalies), with prices above $2. The idea being that these might be oversold and/or due to go up for whatever reasons. I've never felt like I could predict *if* a stock should go up, let alone *when*. But I can tell when one **is** going up. We all can. So my mind immediately went to the *other* extreme of RSI, and I filtered above 70 (and <90). Share price above $50, and Volume >50k were the only other filters I used. I got 46 hits on Barchart, and in hindsight I could've lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates. And maybe price, but I personally wouldn't go <$20. I sorted by 3-month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up. Then I started flipping through charts using Barchart's \"flipcharts\" feature. Candidates I liked, *strictly based on their charts* (no other research) were: ALB, AA, AUGO, PAAS, GM, RIO, FDX, TD, & BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose (because I 'diversify' with just 3 tickers at a time), I charted those 9 against each other by 3's. That yielded these 3 charts: [9 stocks 3 ways, 6-month views]( Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts. (I use 6-month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is.) **Which stock from each chart would** ***you*** **choose?** I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view (and that influenced 2 picks), but I chose: >!AA, RIO, TD!< (Click to see. This is the 'spoiler' feature of Reddit.) As a final sanity check, I plotted them against each other, with SPY as the benchmark: [3 momentum picks vs SPY]( And tbh, I don't like how AA looks in this view, but that's down to it having been in the first tranche of 3, which were highest on the 3-month performance sort. But with the averaging effect of the other 2, I can live with it. I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwim's Paper Money to buy them at Monday's open. They filled at: AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days, but it's early yet. I could update this in a month or two if people are interested. Does anyone else do something like this?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello stock traders . I thought Id share an idea with you . On another subreddit Im on someone had posted a list of low RSI stocks hed screened less than 30 but 10 to weed out anomalies with prices above $ 2 . The idea being that these might be oversold andor due to go up for whatever reasons . Ive never_felt like I could predict if a stock should go up let alone when . But I can tell when one is going up . We all can . So my mind immediately went to the other extreme of RSI and I filtered above 70 and 90 . Share price above $ 50 and Volume 50k were the only other filters I used . I got 46 hits on Barchart and in hindsight I couldve lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates . And maybe price but I personally wouldnt go $ 20 . I sorted by 3month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up . Then I started flipping through charts using Barcharts flipcharts feature . Candidates I liked strictly based on their charts no other research were ALB AA AUGO PAAS GM RIO FDX TD BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose because I diversify with just 3 tickers at a time I charted those 9 against each other by 3s . That yielded these 3 charts 9 stocks 3 ways 6month views Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts . I use 6month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is . Which stock from each chart would you choose I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view and that influenced 2 picks but I chose AA RIO TD Click to see . This is the spoiler feature of Reddit . As a final sanity check I plotted them against each other with SPY as the benchmark 3 momentum picks vs SPY And tbh I dont like how AA looks in this view but thats down to it having been in the first tranche of 3 which were highest on the 3month performance sort . But with the averaging effect of the other 2 I can live with it . I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwims Paper Money to buy them at Mondays open . They filled at AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days but its early yet . I could update this in a month or two if people are interested . Does anyone else do something like this"

      "selftext": "I’m about 10 years away from retiring. The 3% bonus into my Roth is very appealing. I know it’s only $240 (minus the $60 for gold) per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not bother but anything to get more money into my Roth. Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth. I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that. I have no problems having accounts at different brokerages (in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages. ) Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account (would only move a percentage, not all). One question, I assume the gold relationship is per person? So I couldn’t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3% instead of 1? Also, can I buy CEFs, BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood? Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything (general question). I don’t panic trade (well at least I hope not) so I am not worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years. I like the idea of a 3% back credit card, I really have no patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides?",

I know it ’ s only $ 240 minus the $ 60 for gold per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not_bother but anything to get more money into my Roth . Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth . I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that . I have no_problems having accounts at different brokerages in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages . Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account would only move a percentage not_all . One question I assume the gold relationship is per person So I couldn ’ t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3 % instead of 1 Also can I buy CEFs BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything general question . I don ’ t panic trade well at least I hope not_so I am not_worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years . I like the idea of a 3 % back credit card I really have no_patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides"

      "title": "Unusual Move｜Tesla Directly Releases Analyst Forecasts: Q4 Deliveries May Drop 15%, Signaling Demand Pressure?",
      "selftext": "Tesla's stock price has fallen for six consecutive trading days. I just came across an unusual piece of news about Tesla (TSLA) and wanted to share it for discussion. Tesla recently proactively disclosed analysts' forecasts for its fourth-quarter deliveries, breaking from its usual low-key approach. According to these projections, fourth-quarter deliveries may decline by approximately 15% year-over-year, a rare occurrence in Tesla's history. Key factors contributing to demand pressure include: Phasing Out Tax Credits: The gradual withdrawal of electric vehicle subsidies in certain markets significantly impacts marginal demand Intensifying Competition: Traditional automakers and new energy vehicle manufacturers are simultaneously ramping up efforts, fueling ongoing price wars Diminishing demand pull-forward effect: Previous price cuts have already captured some future demand This “pre-disclosure” strategy has also sparked market speculation: Is Tesla actively managing market expectations? Does this signal greater near-term fundamental pressures than previously anticipated? Or is it merely paving the way for a reset in the 2025 growth trajectory? From a trading and investment perspective, this could yield two starkly different interpretations: Bearish View: The high-growth narrative is weakening, necessitating a re-evaluation of valuations. Bullish View: Releasing negative news early could actually mitigate the impact after earnings reports. Tesla currently sits at the intersection of macroeconomic factors, industry competition, and its own growth trajectory. Heightened short-term volatility may become the norm. What are your thoughts? Is this expectation management, or a signal of a demand inflection point? Share your bullish or bearish perspectives.",

      "selftext": "For someone who has always focused on diversification, I've gotten in deep with my latest venture. Before 2023, I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor, with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs, Tech stocks, Real-Estate, and Crypto. On paper, it looked responsible. I slept well. Then in 2023, I made a big life change, relocated, and decided to go all-in on building a company. My third. Fast forward to today, and my personal balance sheet looks completely different. What used to be a \\~$300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset: my ownership equity in an operating fintech company. On paper, that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was (>$3m). In reality, my liquid position is now under 3% compared to 40% before my move. This bothers me. From one angle, this looks like rational concentration - founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highest-conviction asset right?. From another angle, it feels like I’ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside. I’m “wealthier” on paper, but functionally much poorer in cash. So I’m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective: • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management? • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid? • For those who’ve been through this, what did you wish you’d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside? Not looking for validation, genuinely interested in how others frame this trade-off. Am I overthinking it?",

      "selftext": "I recently shifted my focus away from the volatility of the Q2 earnings report and back to Nike's core: its products. After years of criticism for rehashing old designs, Nike's 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its R&D capabilities again. Three recent (or upcoming) key releases have changed my perspective: The \"Unleashed\" Year of the Horse Collection: Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection. The special editions of the G.T. Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the Asia-Pacific region. If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market, it will be a huge support for the \"recovery logic.\" The \"Nike Mind\" Platform (launching January 2026): This is very cutting-edge. Nike is entering the \"neuroscience-based\" footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002. These shoes are designed to enhance \"sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet. This is a completely new category (Mind Science), and likely their response to the \"health/comfort\" trend pioneered by Hoka. 3D Printed Air Max 1000: The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology. Seeing the high premium for the \"Oat\" colorway on the secondary market shows that \"brand heat\" hasn't disappeared, but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously. Investor Question: CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a \"Win Now\" year. With North American wholesale business showing a 24% surge in the December 18th earnings report, are these new products enough to support building a long-term position below $65?",

After years of criticism for rehashing old designs Nikes 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its RD capabilities again . Three recent or upcoming key releases have changed my perspective The Unleashed Year of the Horse Collection Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection . The special editions of the G.T . Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the AsiaPacific region . If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market it will be a huge support for the recovery logic . The Nike Mind Platform launching January 2026 This is very cuttingedge . Nike is entering the neurosciencebased footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002 . These shoes are designed to enhance sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet . This is a completely new category Mind Science and likely their response to the healthcomfort trend pioneered by Hoka . 3D Printed Air Max 1000 The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology . Seeing the high premium for the Oat colorway on the secondary market shows that brand heat hasnt disappeared but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously . Investor Question CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a Win Now year . With North American wholesale business showing a 24 % surge in the December 18th earnings report are these new products enough to support building a longterm position below $ 65"

      "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a post in the community discussing the recent AI tech boom and also shared my thoughts on Intel (INTC) as a stock. A lot of people responded that they’re not optimistic about INTC and think it can’t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA (NVDA). Admittedly, in some respects, Intel isn’t on the same level as those two companies right now. However, I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value, and today’s rally kind of proved my point. I’ve always felt that a stock’s price movement isn’t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research. So I’m really curious when you’re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in, what aspects do you usually pay attention to? What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",

A lot of people responded that they ’ re not_optimistic about INTC and think it can ’ t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA NVDA . Admittedly in some respects Intel isn ’ t on the same level as those two companies right now . However I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value and today ’ s rally kind of proved my point . I ’ ve always felt that a stock ’ s price movement isn ’ t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research . So I ’ m really curious when you ’ re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in what aspects do you usually pay attention to What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock I ’ d love to hear everyone ’ s thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Wishing you all a lot of professional, personal and financial success, and a happy 2026. Influenced by some Reddit users here, I recently started using GetQuin (free version). However, I must admit I find the platform quite complex. I first tried to manually recreate my three stock portfolios, which were built over the course of this year starting from an initial deposit. After that, I imported my transactions from XTB, which actually worked fine. That said, I noticed that the results were not offset against the initial portfolio balance and instead seemed to duplicate the values, which left me a bit confused. Overall, I got the feeling that the platform largely exceeds my actual needs. What I’m looking for is something simpler, excluding Google Finance / Yahoo Finance (and similar tools), that allows me to: Track the performance of each of my portfolios (stocks, fixed-term deposits, and investment funds) And, in particular: Access detailed information on each individual stock Analyse my portfolio by sector and currency Track dividends, namely: payment dates ex-dividend dates expected/forecast dividends For dividend tracking specifically, I was considering starting to use Track Your Dividends, but ideally I’d like to have everything consolidated in a single platform. Do you have any recommendations for platforms that offer both a mobile app and a browser version, preferably free? Thanks in advance!",

I'm watching them very closely in these final trading days of 2025 as I may buy in, expecting an increase as end of year tax selling comes to an end. **GIS** \\- General Mills. Food stocks in general have been in a tough environment. GIS has been in a downward trend for over a year. Current SP: $46.75. 52-wk range: 45.15 - 67.35. They pay a solid dividend of 5.2% Would be a LT hold for me if I can get it on sale in the next day or 2. That one meme stock that isn't always welcomed here. Has been in a steady decline the past couple weeks as retail has tax-loss harvested. Just above it's 52-wk low. Would be a ST hold if I can get in on sale. Not one I want to chase. **HRZN** \\- Horizon Technology Finance - my long-term high yielding stock. It's had some mis-steps the past couple years and has been trending back down towards a 52-week low. Current SP: $6.34. 52-wk range: 5.71 - 10.00 Would probably be a ST hold if it pops. Would love to know of any stocks you're specifically watching!",

They pay a solid dividend of 5.2 % Would be a LT hold for me if I can get it on sale in the next day or 2 . That one meme stock that isnt always welcomed here . Has been in a steady decline the past couple weeks as retail has taxloss harvested . Just above its 52wk low . Would be a ST hold if I can get in on sale . Not_one I want to chase . HRZN Horizon Technology Finance my longterm high yielding stock . Its had some missteps the past couple years and has been trending back down towards a 52week low .

      "selftext": "In 1964, Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway at $7.50 per share, which means that at roughly $756,000 per share (Class A common), it has grown its market price at roughly 20% compounded annually, approximately double the CAGR of the S&P index over the same period. EDIT: Perhaps more impressive is that, using data tracked through 2018, Berkshire's per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7% annualized. No other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years. Buffett changed my life in two ways: First, his 1984 article in Hermes, the Columbia Business School paper, \"[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville](\" introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd, and completely changed my capital allocation/investment management strategy. Second, [this talk]( given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates, specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity. I am confident in Greg Abel's abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders' ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Graham's four key criteria, which I can recite from memory to this day: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*",

The cleanest example is the 28-year microgrid PPA with Topanga Terrace, where the company says it will design, build, own, and operate an on-site system combining solar, battery storage, and gas backup. One coverage summary notes a 2% annual escalator and a company model estimating about $3.85M in gross revenue over the contract term. Then came the A123 MOU, focused on deploying 20-foot 5 MWh storage units across projects. Even if you treat MOUs cautiously, it is a practical de-risking step for a business where storage is a gating component. What makes this more interesting is that short interest has been rising. MarketBeat shows about 4.43M shares sold short as of Dec 15, 2025, roughly 10.66% of the public float, with days to cover around 1.7 NFA",

The cleanest example is the 28year microgrid PPA with Topanga Terrace where the company says it will design build own and operate an onsite system combining solar battery storage and gas backup . One coverage summary notes a 2 % annual escalator and a company model estimating about $ 3.85M in gross revenue over the contract term . Then came the A123 MOU focused on deploying 20foot 5 MWh storage units across projects . Even if you treat MOUs cautiously it is a practical derisking step for a business where storage is a gating component . What makes this more interesting is that short interest has been rising . MarketBeat shows about 4.43M shares sold short as of Dec 15 2025 roughly 10.66 % of the public float with days to cover around 1.7 NFA"

      "selftext": "Disclaimer: This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate. Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes. TL;DR: CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today. At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem. That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it. On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist. This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart. Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it. This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories. It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure. Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways. U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle. Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. That disconnect is the thesis.

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate . Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes . TLDR CPNG only trades in the U.S. but the crisis is entirely in Korea lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension the public is actively boycotting and this is a newly profitable logisticsheavy business that can not survive disruption . U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis not_a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today . At the National Assembly hearing lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it ’ s framed in U.S. outlets . Domestically investigators are disputing Coupang ’ s disclosures challenging sworn testimony and raising perjury accusations . Internationally it ’ s still framed as a data breach plus compensation . Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem . That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S . The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE . There is no_Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage no_local shareholder pressure and no_market release valve . All price discovery happens in the U.S. while all political regulatory and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea . Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it . On the ground public reaction is not_abstract . Lawmakers civic groups and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension not_just fines or apologies . Korean media coverage has shifted from “ breach response ” to “ whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form. ” At the consumer level largescale boycott behavior “ 탈팡 ” is observable with appusage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share . In Korea boycotts are not_symbolic — people actually leave platforms especially when alternatives exist . This is existential for Coupang because of its structure . The company only recently became profitable after years of losses . It is a logisticsheavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume dense routing and habitdriven repeat usage . A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability . Drivers leave . Sellers leave . Customers retrain behavior . This is not_a business you can pause and restart . Two weeks ago Coupang installed a U.S.trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis . Domestically that has been widely interpreted as insulating decisionmakers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability . That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it . This is why this trade is no_longer about valuation multiples or growth trajectories . It ’ s about whether a newly profitable logisticsdependent company — openly boycotted politically isolated under criminal scrutiny and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure . Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways . U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle . Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . That disconnect is the thesis .

      "selftext": "I’ve been reading a lot of threads here, and a big portion of the discussion seems to revolve around headlines/news and “what do I do now?” That made me think about a question we rarely ask directly: What is a stock, in practice? It’s not the news. It’s a price that reflects collective expectations about future cash flows, risk, and sentiment and those expectations update continuously. News can absolutely matter, but reacting to headlines alone often isn’t a repeatable approach because: information is frequently priced quickly, the interpretation (and what’s already expected) matters more than the headline, and results are often dominated by process rather than “having the right info.” Where I’ve seen the biggest difference is having a clear framework that answers: Thesis: what do I believe and what would change my mind? Valuation / expectations: what needs to go right for this price to be justified? Time horizon: is this a 3-month view or a 3 year view? Risk: what’s the downside case and how do I avoid a permanent loss? Position sizing: even if I’m wrong, can I stay in the game? I’m not claiming this is the only way to think about it just sharing a lens that helps me separate noise from signal. Question for the community: When a big news item hits, what determines whether you change your thesis versus do nothing? What’s your decision rule?",

It's clear they believe in the long-term potential, and their actions speak louder than words. Nike’s brand still holds its ground globally, maintaining a leading position in the market. The North American market is showing signs of recovery, and despite a 26% drop in share price, Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world. The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors. With a more attractive valuation, Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity, especially for those who believe in the company’s future growth prospects. The question remains: is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity? Only time will tell, but with insider confidence and global brand strength, it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist.",

However, the profit margin guidance and weakness in the Chinese market still look pretty grim. The only reason I haven't sold or done a Cover Call yet is because I saw Tim Cook bought about $3 million worth of shares last week.

      "selftext": "Coinbase trades pretty in line with Bitcoin so you can see it’s down in the last year. Bitcoin is EXPECTED to bottom in ‘26, whether it actually does or drags longer is another story. Coinbase is also expanding to tokenized stock trading and also using Kalshi for the prediction markets. While I think those two things help them drive additional earnings, I do think the outlook on crypto (especially BTC) is going to weigh more heavily on how this company performs next year than the added lines of business. At least, that’s how I believe the market will overwhelmingly choose to trade the company on. In other words, my assumption is that the stock trading and prediction markets is a nice sweetener but doesn’t change the story (already would face fiercer competition from Robinhood on stuff like this). So given all of this, coupled with the lower PE, (20x) versus others in the industry and assuming BTC will follow a standard cycle and hit a low in the coming is there really any other reason not to buy sometime in the coming year? Holding for a few years at this point seems like it would yield a decent return",

      "selftext": "Recently, MU has continued to fluctuate within a high-range band. Although volatility has increased, it remains fundamentally strong overall. The market's core logic surrounding it still revolves around: AI memory demand, data center expansion, and tight HBM supply these are indeed genuine long-term drivers. My personal perspective: MU currently exhibits distinct characteristics: Solid fundamental logic, not purely a sentiment-driven narrative Continued support at elevated levels, with no significant capital outflow However, divergence is growing, and sentiment is less one-sided than before Therefore, in my view: It possesses the core of a trend while entering a phase requiring validation. Moving forward, focus should shift to earnings delivery, order momentum, and industry pricing trends rather than relying solely on imagination. For MU today, the question is no longer simply “will it rise?” Rather, it's whether the logic behind its ascent can be sustained. While the trend warrants respect, timing and risk awareness are equally crucial. What's your take? In your view, does MU currently represent trend continuation or over-anticipated expectations? Personal observations only. Not investment advice.",

The markets core logic surrounding it still revolves around AI memory demand data center expansion and tight HBM supply these are indeed genuine longterm drivers . My personal perspective MU currently exhibits distinct characteristics Solid fundamental logic not_purely a sentimentdriven narrative Continued support at elevated levels with no_significant capital outflow However divergence is growing and sentiment is less onesided than before Therefore in my view It possesses the core of a trend while entering a phase requiring validation . Moving forward focus should shift to earnings delivery order momentum and industry pricing trends rather than relying solely on imagination . For MU today the question is no_longer simply “ will it rise ” Rather its whether the logic behind its ascent can be sustained . While the trend warrants respect timing and risk awareness are equally crucial . Whats your take In your view does MU currently represent trend continuation or overanticipated expectations Personal observations only . Not_investment advice ."

I’m mainly curious how people here are thinking about AMD going into 2026. On the bullish side, AMD seems to be gaining more traction in data center and AI, and they are still taking market share from Intel. Lisa Su has also built a lot of trust over the years when it comes to execution. On the other hand, the stock has already run up quite a bit and competition in AI, especially from Nvidia, is intense. Valuation is also something I’m not fully sure about at these levels. For those who follow AMD closely, do you think the growth story still has room to play out in 2026? Or do you feel most of the good news is already priced in? Not looking for financial advice, just want to hear different perspectives from long term holders and skeptics. Thanks",

      "selftext": "Okay so $DJT has forever been called a meme stock and for good reasons. Its valuation has been all over the place, it’s never reported any meaningful revenue, there are no price targets for it and basically Wall Street doesn’t consider it a serious company. Well, while that may continue to be the case in the future there’s a chance that it might not if the merger with TAE is successful - or am I wrong? The merger is valued at $6 billion in an all-stock deal, both companies’ shareholders get 50% stakes, deal is expected to close mid-2026. How come the stock isn’t trading at a rock solid $10.71? ~ $3 billion. I guess because intrinsic value matters little? When was it ever a meaningful metric for this stock anyway- but if this merger happens then shouldn’t it begin to be? Maybe the stock is on its way back to $10.71 after it initially rallied on the merger news all the way up to $17 but has since dived back to $13. I just found it curious that this isn’t like when a buyout is announced and the stock trades at a rock solid price.",

Its valuation has been all over the place it ’ s never_reported any meaningful revenue there are no_price targets for it and basically Wall Street doesn ’ t consider it a serious company . Well while that may continue to be the case in the future there ’ s a chance that it might not_if the merger with TAE is successful or am I wrong The merger is valued at $ 6 billion in an allstock deal both companies ’ shareholders get 50 % stakes deal is expected to close mid2026 . How come the stock isn ’ t trading at a rock solid $ 10.71 $ 3 billion . I guess because intrinsic value matters little When was it ever a meaningful metric for this stock anyway but if this merger happens then shouldn ’ t it begin to be Maybe the stock is on its way back to $ 10.71 after it initially rallied on the merger news all the way up to $ 17 but has since dived back to $ 13 . I just found it curious that this isn ’ t like when a buyout is announced and the stock trades at a rock solid price ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a stock trading strategy for the past 4 months and wanted to hear how more experienced people would approach monetizing something like this. The principals are: medium-term trades (avg 20 days), avg 8 concurrent trades, diversified - out of 100 monitored stocks 47 stocks were traded in the 4 month period. Results so far (live trading): * 89 closed trades (1-2 trades a day) * 75% win rate * average trade return +3.1% * profit factor ~5.1 * max drawdown ~1.7% * Sharpe ~3.6. I’m aware that 4 months is not statistically sufficient to claim anything, but given these constraints, I’m curious how experienced traders/investors would think about next steps: continue trading personal capital? (I don't have nearly enough personal wealth, even if this strategy persists - which will double the invested capital each year, the initial capital I can invest right now is way too small to gain something meaningful in the near term). Perhaps trading with leverage can solve this? focus on building a longer live track record? But how much is enough? half a year? a full year? 3 years? By then I might lose the edge I have. position it as research/consulting rather than a trading product? I'm already working on the next iteration monitoring additional companies which will improve performance, but this takes time and effort, and I don't want to wait until it's \"perfect\" rather I'd start now when it's \"good enough\". Also, developing this takes too much time to go along with a full time job, so I need to decide whether to continue developing this or to use the current version as is and abandon any further development. Let me know if you have any critical feedback especially on what you’d want to see before taking something like this seriously. ps - I also add a figure of the capital increase compared to several indices from the last 4 months in the comments.",

      "selftext": "25 year old male. Took 500 to 90k within a month and ended up losing every penny of it (EDIT: THE LOSS PORN IS NOT ABOUT THE $500, but the 90k I peaked at) and now have pretty much nothing to my name. I still have my tech job, but there’s a pretty high chance I’m gonna get laid off soon even if it hasn’t happened yet. Completely lonely in my personal life with no real friends and a non existent dating life. My entire world is crumbling before me and losing all this money is just the final gut punch. If I could give any advice to anyone out there, just don’t trade options. They will ruin your life. Look, I’m not completely giving up yet even though I’m undoubtedly at a very difficult point, but I hope I’ve been able to prevent someone else from having their life ruined by options. Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy’s soon. EDIT: I know that I technically only lost $500, but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k, actually money that I could’ve withdrawn, before falling back to $0. There is no way to mentally see this as just a $500 loss. Trust me I would not be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $500 to $0. By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $0. EDIT: Yes, I regret that I didn’t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $0, but i guess hindsight is 20/20 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past.",

Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy ’ s soon . EDIT I know that I technically only lost $ 500 but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k actually money that I could ’ ve withdrawn before falling back to $ 0 . There is no_way to mentally see this as just a $ 500 loss . Trust me I would not_be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $ 500 to $ 0 . By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $ 0 . EDIT Yes I regret that I didn ’ t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $ 0 but i guess hindsight is 2020 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past ."

      "selftext": "I know reddit is evangelical about index investing so before everyone seethes most of my holdings are HSBC FTSE All-World Index Fund Accumulation C (not investment advice) but I am curious about steel-manning active management. I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above, fees, etc. But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include? For example, Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid. Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g. 7% for less volatility or contain bonds or are target-date funds (retirement) so almost by construction will lose to the market but aren't designed for that purpose. Also a lot of funds measure their return as risk-adjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say, an all world index, after accounting for that and fees? The all-world index (and US even more so) is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 - in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management. Holding 10,000 stock in a global market tracker is also not really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter - meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tail-end where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman, but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation %s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100% equity return maximisers against the index net of fees? Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds? Any other considerations?",

I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above fees etc . But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include For example Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid . Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g . 7 % for less volatility or contain bonds or are targetdate funds retirement so almost by construction will lose to the market but arent designed for that purpose . Also a lot of funds measure their return as riskadjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say an all world index after accounting for that and fees The allworld index and US even more so is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management . Holding 10000 stock in a global market tracker is also not_really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tailend where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation % s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100 % equity return maximisers against the index net of fees Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds Any other considerations"

      "title": "Conversation on Howard Marks' Memo - \"Is [AI] a Bubble?\"",
      "selftext": "I read Howard Marks' memo addressing the widely discussed \"AI Bubble.\" As a novice, still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI, I found it insightful not because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright, but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in - an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy. *For those that read Marks' memo, curious if you had a different takeaway....* While I believe we are in a bubble, the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a mean-reverting bubble (net negative for the economy) or an inflection bubble (net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns). * Mean-Reverting Bubbles * These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk, offering little or no lasting benefit to productivity or human progress. The capital is misallocated, leverage compounds fragility, and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off. * Example: The subprime mortgage-backed securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. * Inflection Bubbles * These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years. While vast amounts of capital are destroyed, a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy. * Example: The dot-com bubble, which accelerated internet infrastructure, normalized online consumer behavior, funded logistics, warehousing, and software systems long before they were profitable. * Amazon is the perfect example, a company that nearly failed, but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale. **Applying this Framework to the AI Era** Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble, but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered: 1. Who will ultimately be the winners? 1. History is unkind to early entrants. There were once thousands of automobile companies; only a handful survive today. AI will likely follow a similar pattern. 2. Will AI generate profits, and for whom? 1. Today, many AI services reportedly lose money on each query. The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share, and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges. 2. Sam Altman stated: \"We'll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.\" 3. Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users? 1. AI is clearly a productive tool, but productivity gains do not automatically translate into profits. Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away? 4. Should we worry about \"circular deals\"? 1. Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s, when fiber-owning companies sold capacity to one another, allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value. 2. Today, (i) OpenAI reportedly committed \\~$1.4T to counterparties despite not yet being profitable, and (ii) Goldman Sachs estimates that \\~15% of Nvidia’s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements. 3. This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine end-demand versus financial engineering. **AI Financing Structures, and Looming Debt Issues** JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure build-out could ultimately cost approx. $5T, while the largest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle) collectively hold only \\~$350B in cash. This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures. I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “good projects” and is beginning to fund marginal ones. Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership, where they structured an SPV so the debt would not sit on Meta's balance sheet. This shifts accounting risk; however, it does not eliminate economic exposure. The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron, where operating control existed without consolidation, and leverage sat outside the partner company's financials. Debt itself is not inherently problematic, instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with long-term economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature. **Takeaway: Are We in an AI Bubble?** I think it's fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change, but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do, how it will be monetized, or the timeline over which returns actually materialize. As is said, \"history rhymes\" and is often instructive. Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s, yet their stocks fell 97% and 96%, respectively, from peak to trough (period covering late 1920s through early 1930s). While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes, it is important context. Going in favor of AI, is that it already has products with over a billion active users; leading players are established companies with revenue, cash flow, and some profits; and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes. Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today, it is hard to argue AI will not drive real productivity gains and long-term economic benefits. What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested. If we assume \\~$1T in invested capital in AI-related capex and infrastructure, achieving a 20% return requires generating 3-6x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 5-10 year period; not revenue, but distributable cash flow. Once we account for failed projects, overbuilt infrastructure, and the concentration of value among a small number of winners, the burden falls on the winners (assuming Nvidia, Google, and a handful of others) to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous. In short: I believe AI is an inflection bubble, one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity, but also one where many investors will not earn the returns they anticipate, and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises.

      "selftext_processed": "I read Howard Marks memo addressing the widely discussed AI Bubble . As a novice still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI I found it insightful not_because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy . For those that read Marks memo curious if you had a different takeaway .... While I believe we are in a bubble the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a meanreverting bubble net negative for the economy or an inflection bubble net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns . MeanReverting Bubbles These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk offering little or no_lasting benefit to productivity or human progress . The capital is misallocated leverage compounds fragility and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off . Example The subprime mortgagebacked securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis . Inflection Bubbles These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years . While vast amounts of capital are destroyed a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy . Example The dotcom bubble which accelerated internet infrastructure normalized online consumer behavior funded logistics warehousing and software systems long before they were profitable . Amazon is the perfect example a company that nearly failed but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale . Applying this Framework to the AI Era Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered 1. Who will ultimately be the winners 1 . History is unkind to early entrants . There were once thousands of automobile companies only a handful survive today . AI will likely follow a similar pattern . 2 . Will AI generate profits and for whom 1 . Today many AI services reportedly lose money on each query . The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges . 2 . Sam Altman stated Well build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it . 3 . Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users 1 . AI is clearly a productive tool but productivity gains do not_automatically translate into profits . Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away 4 . Should we worry about circular deals 1 . Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s when fiberowning companies sold capacity to one another allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value . 2 . Today i OpenAI reportedly committed $ 1.4T to counterparties despite not_yet being profitable and ii Goldman Sachs estimates that 15 % of Nvidia ’ s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements . 3 . This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine enddemand versus financial engineering . AI Financing Structures and Looming Debt Issues JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure buildout could ultimately cost approx . $ 5T while the largest spenders Microsoft Alphabet Amazon Meta and Oracle collectively hold only $ 350B in cash . This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures . I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “ good projects ” and is beginning to fund marginal ones . Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership where they structured an SPV so the debt would not_sit on Metas balance sheet . This shifts accounting risk however it does not_eliminate economic exposure . The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron where operating control existed without consolidation and leverage sat outside the partner companys financials . Debt itself is not_inherently problematic instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with longterm economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature . Takeaway Are We in an AI Bubble I think its fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do how it will be monetized or the timeline over which returns actually materialize . As is said history rhymes and is often instructive . Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s yet their stocks fell 97 % and 96 % respectively from peak to trough period covering late 1920s through early 1930s . While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes it is important context . Going in favor of AI is that it already has products with over a billion active users leading players are established companies with revenue cash flow and some profits and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes . Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today it is hard to argue AI will not_drive real productivity gains and longterm economic benefits . What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested . If we assume $ 1T in invested capital in AIrelated capex and infrastructure achieving a 20 % return requires generating 36x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 510 year period not_revenue but distributable cash flow . Once we account for failed projects overbuilt infrastructure and the concentration of value among a small number of winners the burden falls on the winners assuming Nvidia Google and a handful of others to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous . In short I believe AI is an inflection bubble one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity but also one where many investors will not_earn the returns they anticipate and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises ."

I already have a monthly savings plan running for a few ETFs . Should I just dump the sum into that Or make some oneoff stock purchases Or do something completely different Obviously this is a very small amount in investment terms but surely there must be something worthwhile I can do with it Thanks in advance for any tips ."

      "selftext": "Opinion: Symbotic’s future growth valuation is not taking into account its 35% stake in Green Box, an AI warehouse as a service business. Currently Symbotic is viewed as a pure play robotics company, simply supplying its AI robotics system to companies such as Walmart and Target. Symbotic’s AI robotics system is the only rival to Amazon’s system, which has been proven to be a game changer and the key to unlocking fast and accurate order fulfilment when 1000s of SKUs are available. If companies want to compete with Amazon, they will need Symbotic’s systems and this is what we are seeing with Walmart, Target and recently Medline. This is already well known and baked into the company valuation, with the company trading at just under 16 x revenue. What I believe is not factored in is the warehouse as a service market and their unique opportunity to capture a huge share of this through Green Box, their joint venture with Soft Bank to provide multi tenant warehousing services fit out with their custom AI robotics systems. Quick maths show that the WaaS market was $12 billion USD growing at 15% per year, giving a value of $25 billion USD in 2028. If Green Box can capture 35% market share (first Green Box locations go live 2026) that is revenue of $3.06 billion. Current robotics sales forecast is $4.16 billion in 2028 (massive >$22 billion back log) so that would be a total revenue of $7.22 billion USD. Multiply by current Market Cap/Revenue ratio of 15.8 and divide by share count and that gives a share value of $189 using just US market alone. Now, if you take this and apply it to the total international WaaS market with an estimated TAM of $2.69 trillion USD in 2030 and estimate that Symbotic can capture just 1%, we get a share price of $256 (assuming it is trading at 10 x revenue) accounting for only $6 billion in revenue from robotic system sales. Obviously this would be way higher so conservatively we could say $300 - $400 per share. I believe massive share dilution is not a huge risk as Soft Bank is financing the Green Box venture. Obviously stock based compensation could be an issue but people said that about PLTR when it was a >$20 stock and now look at it. To be fair I am probably a bit early with my revenue predictions as it take a couple years to build out a Green Box site and start recognising revenue, so I am accumulating shares, but might grab some calls should there be a large drop for end of 2026 when the first revenue from Green Box is recognised.",

      "selftext_processed": "Opinion Symbotic ’ s future growth valuation is not_taking into account its 35 % stake in Green Box an AI warehouse as a service business . Currently Symbotic is viewed as a pure play robotics company simply supplying its AI robotics system to companies such as Walmart and Target . Symbotic ’ s AI robotics system is the only rival to Amazon ’ s system which has been proven to be a game changer and the key to unlocking fast and accurate order fulfilment when 1000s of SKUs are available . If companies want to compete with Amazon they will need Symbotic ’ s systems and this is what we are seeing with Walmart Target and recently Medline . This is already well known and baked into the company valuation with the company trading at just under 16 x revenue . What I believe is not_factored in is the warehouse as a service market and their unique opportunity to capture a huge share of this through Green Box their joint venture with Soft Bank to provide multi tenant warehousing services fit out with their custom AI robotics systems . Quick maths show that the WaaS market was $ 12 billion USD growing at 15 % per year giving a value of $ 25 billion USD in 2028 . If Green Box can capture 35 % market share first Green Box locations go live 2026 that is revenue of $ 3.06 billion . Current robotics sales forecast is $ 4.16 billion in 2028 massive $ 22 billion back log so that would be a total revenue of $ 7.22 billion USD . Multiply by current Market CapRevenue ratio of 15.8 and divide by share count and that gives a share value of $ 189 using just US market alone . Now if you take this and apply it to the total international WaaS market with an estimated TAM of $ 2.69 trillion USD in 2030 and estimate that Symbotic can capture just 1 % we get a share price of $ 256 assuming it is trading at 10 x revenue accounting for only $ 6 billion in revenue from robotic system sales . Obviously this would be way higher so conservatively we could say $ 300 $ 400 per share . I believe massive share dilution is not_a huge risk as Soft Bank is financing the Green Box venture . Obviously stock based compensation could be an issue but people said that about PLTR when it was a $ 20 stock and now look at it . To be fair I am probably a bit early with my revenue predictions as it take a couple years to build out a Green Box site and start recognising revenue so I am accumulating shares but might grab some calls should there be a large drop for end of 2026 when the first revenue from Green Box is recognised ."

      "selftext": "For each post, I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers. Then I cross-referenced it with data from Polygon.io. I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later. Here’s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact: 1 ) The famous U.S. Steel partnership post. It's pretty long [so here's the link.]( Affected ticker: X + 13.48% 2) I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Bill needs no formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country, because they have seen, and many have experienced, his philanthropy firsthand. He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation, and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL. Congratulations Bill! Tickers: FNMA + 5.64% FMCC + 3.70% 3) Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.

I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long so heres the link . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

Citi forecasts that XPUs will grow faster than GPUs by 2027, driven by a smaller base and the acceleration of custom AI chip programs.

I’ll not be needing or wanting the funds starting from 2030 leading up to 2032 (so 7 year max they’ll be in there for with us withdrawing some in 2030 & 2031) as we are using it for a Lapland & Florida fund for my daughter when she’s older. Is it viable or would a standard Cash ISA account be better? I know that’s a pretty hard question to ask as it’s based on markets but people have said anything under 5 years for a stocks and shares ISA is pointless?",

      "selftext": "Firstly, let me say I hate these over-done posts as much as the next person hah, but I did want to offer my insights as a 20+ year investor with both a long portfolio and an options portfolio that I generate a living income off of. My long portfolio is currently 100% SGOV. Without overanalyzing or cherry picking, the simplest historic indicators show that market valuations right now are extremely rich, of the type that always proceeds a major correction. Shiller PE nearing dot-com levels: [ Trailing PE highest on record: [ Forward PE at a ceiling it only surpasses during major market crises: [ On top of that you have a flight to safety, gold, and a flight from risk, bitcoin, rounding out 2025 narratives. However, despite this, I'm not actually bearish for 2026. There will be an come-uppance, we all know this, but I can see 2026 melting up another 5-10%. This is because the single most influential variable the market has responded to in the last 15 years is liquidity, and apparently the biggest source of liquidity isn't jobs or GDP, but interest rates. This has driven the Main St vs. Wall St divide since 2008. Now the US has an administration that is hell bent on lowering interest rates, regardless of any orthodox impetus to do this. Trump will be appointing a new Fed chair, and possibly more members, who will basically vote how he says. Not only that, but I could see this new chair making statements during any moderate 10% market correction that support QE and rescuing the market, meaning almost any red month will be a buy-the-dip type situation. We also have a pending SCOTUS decision, possibly as soon as Jan 9th, that actually looks like it could undo tariffs, which I think would cause a rally in the S&P493. You never know with someone like Trump at the handle, but it's hard for me to see any major negative catalysts for 2026, aside from 'concerns about valuations'. Maybe a single missed ER by nVidia will cause an unwind, or maybe global liquidity will begin to dry-up as most other OECD nations take more moderate monetary policies and more severe theories about the yen carry-trade show true. I always play defensively as I live off my savings - I intend to stay in SGOV in my long portfolio - I'll take a safe 4.25% over a risky 8.5% any day of the week. For options, where I normally sell CSPs, I'll likely pursue more delta neutral strategies.",

My long portfolio is currently 100 % SGOV . Without overanalyzing or cherry picking the simplest historic indicators show that market valuations right now are extremely rich of the type that always proceeds a major correction . Shiller PE nearing dotcom levels Trailing PE highest on record Forward PE at a ceiling it only surpasses during major market crises On top of that you have a flight to safety gold and a flight from risk bitcoin rounding out 2025 narratives . However despite this Im not_actually bearish for 2026 . There will be an comeuppance we all know this but I can see 2026 melting up another 510 % . This is because the single most influential variable the market has responded to in the last 15 years is liquidity and apparently the biggest source of liquidity isnt jobs or GDP but interest rates . This has driven the Main St vs. Wall St divide since 2008 . Now the US has an administration that is hell bent on lowering interest rates regardless of any orthodox impetus to do this . Trump will be appointing a new Fed chair and possibly more members who will basically vote how he says . Not_only that but I could see this new chair making statements during any moderate 10 % market correction that support QE and rescuing the market meaning almost any red month will be a buythedip type situation . We also have a pending SCOTUS decision possibly as soon as Jan 9th that actually looks like it could undo tariffs which I think would cause a rally in the SP493 . You never_know with someone like Trump at the handle but its hard for me to see any major negative catalysts for 2026 aside from concerns about valuations . Maybe a single missed ER by nVidia will cause an unwind or maybe global liquidity will begin to dryup as most other OECD nations take more moderate monetary policies and more severe theories about the yen carrytrade show true . I always play defensively as I live off my savings I intend to stay in SGOV in my long portfolio Ill take a safe 4.25 % over a risky 8.5 % any day of the week . For options where I normally sell CSPs Ill likely pursue more delta neutral strategies ."

But the stock has taken a beating: * 6 months: -15% * 1 year: -24% * 5 year: -5% The disconnect seems to be around competitive risk and whether Yelp's core business model is actually sustainable. Investors are clearly concerned about how the company fits in as AI becomes more integrated into search and discovery. Google and other search platforms are increasingly showing reviews and recommendations without sending users to Yelp. That's a real threat to their traffic and ad model. That said, fundamentally the company is still executing well. Revenue and profitability are moving in the right direction, margins are healthy, and they're returning cash to shareholders. So it's not like the business is falling apart. The question I'm wrestling with: is the market overreacting to the AI threat, or is there a structural decline coming that the financials haven't fully reflected yet? The valuation seems reasonable if the business model holds, but risky if it doesn't.",

But the stock has taken a beating 6 months 15 % 1 year 24 % 5 year 5 % The disconnect seems to be around competitive risk and whether Yelps core business model is actually sustainable . Investors are clearly concerned about how the company fits in as AI becomes more integrated into search and discovery . Google and other search platforms are increasingly showing reviews and recommendations without sending users to Yelp . Thats a real threat to their traffic and ad model . That said fundamentally the company is still executing well . Revenue and profitability are moving in the right direction margins are healthy and theyre returning cash to shareholders . So its not_like the business is falling apart . The question Im wrestling with is the market overreacting to the AI threat or is there a structural decline coming that the financials havent fully reflected yet The valuation seems reasonable if the business model holds but risky if it doesnt ."

      "selftext": "For each post, I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers. Then I cross-referenced it with data from Polygon.io. I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later. Here’s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact: 1) The famous U.S. Steel partnership post. It's pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links aren't allowed on this sub, [so I'm linking an article talking about it]( There's a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post. Affected ticker: X, + 13.48% 2) I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Bill needs no formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country, because they have seen, and many have experienced, his philanthropy firsthand. He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation, and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL. Congratulations Bill! Tickers: FNMA + 5.64% FMCC + 3.70% 3) Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW, + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.",

      "selftext_processed": "For each post I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers . Then I crossreferenced it with data from Polygon.io . I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links arent allowed on this sub so Im linking an article talking about it Theres a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

      "selftext": "Obviously a lot of traction of the outperformance of the [2025 WSB picks]( I wanted to do a slightly more thorough analysis to see if there was any real alpha here. **TLDR:** *evidence of excess returns, but the performance is best explained by a highly aggressive, factor-loaded portfolio in a strong market environment* To evaluate alpha, I used standard asset-pricing models, including CAPM and the Fama-French four-factor model (market, size, value, and momentum). These models help distinguish returns driven by skill from returns driven by exposure to known risk factors such as growth, momentum, or small-cap bias. The portfolio was an equal weighted basket of the 10 picks: * AMD * GOOG * HOOD * META * MSTR * PLTR * RDDT * RKLB * TSLA * WMT *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* (*Note: this analysis is through Nov 28, since Fama-French hasnt published daily returns for December*) **Descriptive Stats:** * **Portfolio Return**: 61.2% * **SPY Return**: 17.9% * **Portfolio Outperformance**: 43.3% * **Portfolio Vol**: 44.5% * **SPY Vol**: 20.2% * **Portfolio Sharpe | Sortino**: 1.85 | 2.82 * **SPY Sharpe | Sortino**: 0.86 | 1.29 ***Interpretation:*** *significant outperformance, with significantly more volatility* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **CAPM Regression** * **Adj. R-Squared**: 0.718 * **Market beta**: 1.88 ***Interpretation:*** *The portfolio had an extremely high beta. I.e. if the market goes up, all else equal you expect the portfolio to go up 1.88x the market. If it goes down, same thing in reverse* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Fama-French Four Factor Regression** * **Mkt-Rf**: 1.59 *(very high market risk)* * **SMB**: 0.64 (small cap weighted) * **HML**: -0.73 *(strong growth bias)* * **MOM**: 0.51 *(significant momentum exposure)* ***Interpretation:*** *Confirms that the portfolio was significantly weighted towards \"levered\" growth names* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Conclusions:** nothing novel here, WSB tilts towards higher risk, momentum names. If the same exercise is done in 2026, you should expect outperformance if the market goes up and underperformance if the market goes down. *Sources/Methods: Fama-French Library, yFinance, Python* *Happy to answer any questions or provide code if people are interested in running it themselves*",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, so, I am an idiot. a real big one, life-changing, dumb decisions type of idiot. If you spoke with me on October 1st, I was a legend. turned 80k to 220k+ in investments. Speak with me now, and you'll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k+ into 70k. How I got there: Google calls, Soxl calls, UNH calls, Path calls. How I got to where I am now: Iren, CIFR, DGXX. What a fool I am lol wow. It happened quickly and slowly. Didn't realize how heavily I was invested in one sector. Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR. Not just my cash tho, margin too. Then the landslide happened. Wow, did I get fucked. Some bouncing around happened, had some up days, but over the past 2 months, it has been a mental deterioration. Kept throwing in more cash on every dip. So, ya, I fucked up, been rather depressed lately. I was not conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money. I saw a 5% dip, and that was 12k, felt the need to micromanage my positions. bought and sold like crazy. SO what am I doing now? I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler, gambling my life away. It is true **I did gamble**, but that stops here. What I have done: Sold 70% of equity positions and 100% of my option contracts. Bought mainly VOO, and a small bit of QQQI, SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure. This was my first real year of investing, a rough year mentally. Having trouble finding any motivation anymore. But I can't afford that. This is affecting my job performance, marriage, and home life. Constant panic attacks in the evenings, glued to my phone during market open, and glued to futures during market closed. I don't really believe in myself anymore. I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it. Had all my checks and balances and made a killing. But when it mattered most, I threw away my rules and f'd up. It was crazy, one day I checked my port in the morning, it was +3%. By lunch, it was -22%. By the next day, -35%. One more day after, -45%. I literally was in shock watching the red just climb. Since then, death by 1000 cuts. My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing. Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions. Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5% of port. it just sucks I decided to do this now. Not when I had 200k, not 150k, not even at 100k. But now that I have lost so much, I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market. If you read this all, be thankful this isn't you and use this as a reminder to re-read your rules. I never thought this would happen to me, scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice, looking at losses and going ya, no, that will **never be me**. lol life had dif plans. For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar, perhaps not as bad, or worse. What got you back on your feet? It is as if I am wearing red-coloured glasses. Everything just fucking sucks right now, can't find happiness in anything. EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is responding. It is keeping my head on my shoulders. I will keep reading comments and responding. I want this to have a positive effect on someone. Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage. Or someone who is up big right now and doesn't know if they should take profits.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone so I am an idiot . a real big one lifechanging dumb decisions type of idiot . If you spoke with me on October 1st I was a legend . turned 80k to 220k in investments . Speak with me now and youll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k into 70k . How I got there Google calls Soxl calls UNH calls Path calls . How I got to where I am now Iren CIFR DGXX . What a fool I am lol wow . It happened quickly and slowly . Didnt realize how heavily I was invested in one sector . Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR . Not_just my cash tho margin too . Then the landslide happened . Wow did I get fucked . Some bouncing around happened had some up days but over the past 2 months it has been a mental deterioration . Kept throwing in more cash on every dip . So ya I fucked up been rather depressed lately . I was not_conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money . I saw a 5 % dip and that was 12k felt the need to micromanage my positions . bought and sold like crazy . SO what am I doing now I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler gambling my life away . It is true I did gamble but that stops here . What I have done Sold 70 % of equity positions and 100 % of my option contracts . Bought mainly VOO and a small bit of QQQI SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure . This was my first real year of investing a rough year mentally . Having trouble finding any motivation anymore . But I cant afford that . This is affecting my job performance marriage and home life . Constant panic attacks in the evenings glued to my phone during market open and glued to futures during market closed . I dont really believe in myself anymore . I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it . Had all my checks and balances and made a killing . But when it mattered most I threw away my rules and fd up . It was crazy one day I checked my port in the morning it was 3 % . By lunch it was 22 % . By the next day 35 % . One more day after 45 % . I literally was in shock watching the red just climb . Since then death by 1000 cuts . My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing . Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions . Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5 % of port . it just sucks I decided to do this now . Not_when I had 200k not_150k not_even at 100k . But now that I have lost so much I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market . If you read this all be thankful this isnt you and use this as a reminder to reread your rules . I never_thought this would happen to me scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice looking at losses and going ya no_that will never be me . lol life had dif plans . For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar perhaps not_as bad or worse . What got you back on your feet It is as if I am wearing redcoloured glasses . Everything just fucking sucks right now cant find happiness in anything . EDIT Thanks to everyone who is responding . It is keeping my head on my shoulders . I will keep reading comments and responding . I want this to have a positive effect on someone . Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage . Or someone who is up big right now and doesnt know if they should take profits ."

      "selftext": "I want to share some analysis I’ve been thinking about. I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts. This is for discussion and research purposes only. # 1. Burry’s Thesis Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io]( This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com]( He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com]( and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit). The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position. # 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org]( The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org]( Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD. # 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth]( giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200]( (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price. [Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024]( with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments. The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly. # 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs: |Phase|CPU Generation|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers| |2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention| |3|Milan|Default choice for workloads| |4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share| This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs. # 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation. * NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales * Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace * Refresh cycles could stretch * Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash. # 6. Signals to Watch * MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 * Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale * ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration * NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates. # 7. Bottom Line * NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next. * Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact. * The AI shift is gradual and structural. * If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape. This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*",

      "selftext_processed": "I want to share some analysis I ’ ve been thinking about . I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts . This is for discussion and research purposes only . 1 . Burry ’ s Thesis Michael Burry ’ s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated . Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years en.bloomingbit.io This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality . Burry estimates this mismatch could total $ 176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 investing.com He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dotcom era sahmcapital.com and is using longdated puts expiring in 2027 reddit . The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real . But Burry may underestimate AMD ’ s strategic position . 2 . How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA ’ s AI dominance was not_planned from day one . CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for generalpurpose computing not_AI . Ian Buck a Stanford CS PhD experimented with GPUs for nongraphics workloads . His project Brook became the foundation for CUDA en.wikipedia.org The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers . Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude en.wikipedia.org Key takeaway NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company . That “ stumble ” created their early dominance but nothing_guarantees the next discovery will not_favor AMD . 3 . AMD ’ s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with 192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TBs bandwidth giving it a 36 % memory advantage over NVIDIAs H200 141GB HBM3e 4.8 TBs . Cost is approximately $ 1014k per MI300X versus $ 4044k for H200 roughly one quarter of NVIDIAs price . Microsoft Meta Oracle and TensorWave deployed 327000 MI300X units in 2024 with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services . This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale not_experimental deployments . The main constraint is ROCm software maturity . Historical precedent suggests this is temporary CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance . If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings AMDs hardware advantage could scale rapidly . 4 . EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical generationovergeneration growth in server CPUs PhaseCPU GenerationResult 1NaplesReentry into data centers 2RomeCompetitive performance and cost gains attention 3MilanDefault choice for workloads 4GenoaTurinDominant market share This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally . The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs . 5 . The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not_bursting . That implies sudden collapse . What I see is a gradual rotation . NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace Refresh cycles could stretch Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no_expectation of panic selling . Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold . Burry ’ s longdated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash . 6 . Signals to Watch MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates . 7 . Bottom Line NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company . AMD could be next . Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch but he underestimates AMDs potential impact . The AI shift is gradual and structural . If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape . This analysis is based on research and historical patterns . History is repeating itself and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA just like they did with Intel ."

Longer life cycle(further cost saving). 1/4 of $EOSE pipeline is tied to data centers, best fast response alternative to outdated diesel generators and more cost efficient.

      "selftext": "The narrative in AI hardware is undergoing a significant shift. NVIDIA is officially entering the ASIC and inference market through its partnership with Groq, involving about 20 billion dollars in inference machines. This marks a new phase in AI computing NVIDIA is expanding from GPU-dominated training into ASIC dominated inference. What does this mean? Here are some of my guesses GPUs still firmly dominate AI model training. But hyperscale cloud providers and enterprise customers are increasingly leaning toward specialized chips, ASICs, to better control power, depreciation costs, and unit economics, achieving low-latency, cost-effective inference deployments. This does not mean NVIDIA is pessimistic, on the contrary it shows AI spending is diversifying, with funds flowing into multiple chip architectures rather than concentrating on a single winner. ASICs are evolving from a previously niche position to becoming a core necessity for cost efficient inference in the AI stack. Overall, in the thin liquidity environment at year-end, this structural shift in the AI hardware sector is drawing market attention, but short-term price volatility calls for caution. More meaningful trend validation might not come until January 2026. Will NVDA continue to rise and break the 5 trillion mark? What does today's market drop signal? I am already a long-term holder, but will the market shift in2026 and should I continue holding?",

      "selftext": "WeRide is top performing in 2025 in my opinion. The company has largely expanded their operations across global markets, the Middle East, SEA and Europe. They run their fully driverless service in Abu Dhabi with Uber. In Europe, WRD secured their approval in Switzerland's Zurich region and the company expanding fleets in Singapore, planning to operate fully driverless in 2026. Most importantly, the company focus on Level 4 autonomy in defined markets. Rather than just concentrating on single one, WeRide is contributing to the broader evolution of autonomous driving industry. WeRide is advancing their vehicles with WePilot 3.0, one-stage, end-to-end ADAS system, developed with Bosc. The system helps the vehicles to see and act, more like human driving behavior in real time. These efforts clearly show how the autonomy market is moving forward in 2016.",

      "selftext": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\". So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis: The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. The entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. There's two bottlenecks: InP Substrates - \\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc) \\- Optical transceivers (5g, data) \\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military) \\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters) \\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia’s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.) This is a DUOPOLY from \\-AXTI (est. \\~30–35%) \\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%) \\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%) Indium Phosphide (the source material for everything): Vital Materials - 35% AXT - 25% Before, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom. Now they're used for the entire AI buildout. Just to give u an example $AXTI -> $LITE -> $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down. Google would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -> hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls. THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand > supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI. This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. NFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout. I just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout. It's a monopoly in mining -> refining -> substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary. TLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.",

      "selftext_processed": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams . And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for low quality . So heres the more TLDR version of my thesis The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects . The entire AI Growth story ends in 2026 if theres no_InP substrates materials . BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL One Company $ AXTI . Theres two bottlenecks InP Substrates Hyperscaler optics TPU pods etc Optical transceivers 5g data LiDAR robotaxis drones military Optical Modules interconnect clusters Silicon photonics laser dies Nvidia ’ s future copackaged optics and IntelBroadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays . This is a DUOPOLY from AXTI est . 30–35 % Sumitomo est.30 % JX Nippon est . 1015 % Indium Phosphide the source material for everything Vital Materials 35 % AXT 25 % Before this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom . Now theyre used for the entire AI buildout . Just to give u an example $ AXTI $ LITE $ GOOGL TPU . without any of these members the program shuts down . Google would literally pay $ 5B 50 TIMES prices $ 140m TAM from 2024 DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesnt stall because Meta decided to buy them out . And this would only be a like a 34 % added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap . If Meta does it first then Googles TPU program stalls . If Google does it first Microsofts ASIC problem stalls . THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW demand supply by multiple factors preramp AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains . Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI . This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis materials research . Nobodys_posted about this stock here in the past 5 years youre welcome . Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday because theres a low chance this goes from $ 15 to $ 150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026 . I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof . NFI theres a chance China sends this to $ 0 with export controls so dont follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts . But if this goes to $ 0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout . I just thought this could also easily be a $ 7B company given they control 13rd of the worlds entire substrate capacity and then 14th of the worlds entire materials used for AI buildout . Its a monopoly in mining refining substrate production . And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide . I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary . TLDR THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY . FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $ 700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP ."

Recently, I decided to finally pull the trigger and move to a platform that prioritizes stability over gamification. Here is my honest breakdown after using moomoo daily: Pros: * Market Data: The free Level 2 data is a game-changer. Unlike my old app where I had to pay extra or just guess, seeing the order book depth here helps a lot. * Trading Hours: The access to full pre-market (4 AM ET) is excellent. I like being able to react to news before the standard market opens. * charts: The charting is intense. I honestly only use VWAP and RSI, but it’s nice to have a million other indicators available if I ever get smart enough to use them. Cons: * The UI is... A Lot: It’s super cluttered. Information overload is real. Has anyone else finally made the switch to moomoo recently? For those of you who have been using moomoo for a while, what are your thoughts on the platform?

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I turned 18 in April. I have a long time horizon (40+ years), and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction. I’m trying to be intentional about account placement, taxes, and risk. Before anyone says anything, I’ve maxed my Roth IRA already, and plan to keep on doing so. I also had roughly 2k in my taxable. **Roth IRA (growth focused):** **• 65% VOO** **• 35% QQQM** My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I’m young. **Taxable account:** **• 60% equal weighted sector growth stocks** **• 30% AVUV (US small cap value)** **• 10% SPYI** The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated. It is approximately 55% technology, 20% healthcare, 10% financials, 5% consumer discretionary, 5% consumer staples, and 5% crypto via a thematic ETF. The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term. This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions, especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds. AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods. SPYI is intentionally kept small. The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow, while reinvesting all distributions for now. I am not trying to market time or trade frequently. This is meant to be a long term, mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing. **Curious to hear thoughts on:** **• Asset location choices** **• The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure** **• Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient** Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I turned 18 in April . I have a long time horizon 40 years and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction . I ’ m trying to be intentional about account placement taxes and risk . Before anyone says anything I ’ ve maxed my Roth IRA already and plan to keep on doing so . I also had roughly 2k in my taxable . Roth IRA growth focused • 65 % VOO • 35 % QQQM My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I ’ m young . Taxable account • 60 % equal weighted sector growth stocks • 30 % AVUV US small cap value • 10 % SPYI The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated . It is approximately 55 % technology 20 % healthcare 10 % financials 5 % consumer discretionary 5 % consumer staples and 5 % crypto via a thematic ETF . The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term . This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds . AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods . SPYI is intentionally kept small . The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow while reinvesting all distributions for now . I am not_trying to market time or trade frequently . This is meant to be a long term mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing . Curious to hear thoughts on • Asset location choices • The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure • Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient Thanks in advance for any feedback ."

Each sale I've made was for a reason and not always the right one. I sold KTOS because the stock was sliding to my purchase price before earnings and I had a small position. It popped afterwards. I recently bought back in after another dip so it worked out. I just checked on Carpenter Technologies, one of my first stocks, and it's at $324.25 shit ! I sold because tariffs were dragging it down and I figured growth would flatten out. Big mistake. I'm seeing an entry point for ATI to get back into manufactured metals for turbines, rockets, satellites, medical devices and defense. Point being it was one of my first stocks and I had total confidence in the company and I let emotions and some volitiliy make the decision to sell for me.",

Each sale Ive made was for a reason and not_always the right one . I sold KTOS because the stock was sliding to my purchase price before earnings and I had a small position . It popped afterwards . I recently bought back in after another dip so it worked out . I just checked on Carpenter Technologies one of my first stocks and its at $ 324.25 shit I sold because tariffs were dragging it down and I figured growth would flatten out . Big mistake . Im seeing an entry point for ATI to get back into manufactured metals for turbines rockets satellites medical devices and defense . Point being it was one of my first stocks and I had total confidence in the company and I let emotions and some volitiliy make the decision to sell for me ."

      "selftext": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my “bags”. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn’t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. Why am I bullish on oil? Well, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order : 1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row). 2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing. 3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100. 4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1. 5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point. One of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. Here’s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. XOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN Anyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open it wouldn ’ t move it a needle . With that being said I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026 I believe that energy equities could outperform . Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $ 55 crude . Yes an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver . Read that again . Can it go lower Sure . Is it sustainable No_I think in hindsight this will have been obvious . Sometimes things are cheap enough . Why am I bullish on oil Well I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it . I will try to keep this short and concise . In no_particular order 1 . The massive supply glut is overstated and demand is not_as weak as forecasted either . Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 not that IEA has any real credibility . They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row . 2 . Most of the worlds oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale . There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked or is close . Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices contrary to what the Mango man wants their production will not_be growing . 3 . XLE makes up less than 3 % of SPY . Just going back to the historical average of 68 % would imply massive gains for the equities . The bullish case is not_necessairly dependent on crude hitting $ 100 . 4 . Seasonality . Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1 . 5 . Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point . One of my favorite boomers to listen to Rick Rule says that you dont need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities . He thinks XOM is selling at 60 % of NPV meaning at 40 % discount . Im personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant . The Canadian OG stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and Im betting that he will enable them . He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US OG names . Im also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks . Here ’ s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats . XOM CVX COP CNQ SU OXY DVN Anyways thats it for now . Im off to play some poker . See you degens on Monday ."

They had a decent quarter, ARR, Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price. I work in tech nationally. Every company that I talk to (from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet) are switching from VMWare to Nutanix. Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they’re bleeding customers now. The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that’s really only for MS customers who are only MS. This feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?",
