Because I’ve got one name that sits right in the middle of the domestic supply chain theme: USAR. This isn’t when Washington talks on a policy, but when Mar-a-Lago starts talking “critical minerals,” that’s not a press release, that’s procurement, grants, offtakes. And when that money moves, it doesn’t drip in - it floods. USAR isn’t “a stock” — it’s a theme. When money needs to be j moved it isn’t just moved. It’s called an offering and it’s just a flash sale to most professionals. This trades like everyone cares, but you just didn’t buy this in time. You didn’t buy the Trump stamp of approval, you bought the US state sign of wtf it’s going on.",

      "selftext": "Recently the Colombian market has started to rebound mainly due to peso strengthening against a weak dollar and inflows from emerging market investment. Recently the bank of colombia has taken large amounts of external debts at high interest rates artificially propping up the peso making Colombia one of the highest interest payers in dollars in the world relative to their exports. If you look at a 15 year chart comparing $COLO to ClW00(continuous crude oil) you see in 2015 it crashed 70% from the U.s starting to raise rates as well as crude oil prices crashing. If you look at the chart now you can see the huge divergence. I believe the Colombian president is artificially propping up the peso for his party because the election is in a few months as well as this year he raised minimum wage 22% to $550 a month. The economy is incredibly vulnerable with the Colombian bank rate at 9.5% and their inflation sticking at 5%, they will eventually be either forced raising interest rates driving out foreign investment with their unemployment rate already at 8-9% or printing their way out which is a bad idea since their external loans have high interest and their export industry is already struggling.",

      "selftext": "Here is a DD, fellow window lickers. The Europoors have an investible asset for once. The pride of the Italian construction worker & Dubai sheikh. Ferrari: $RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis. Its business model, demand dynamics, and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any mass-market OEM. Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings, while Ferrari trades closer to the mid-thirties at the moment. Based on trailing EPS, a Hermès-level earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels. The gap is not due to inferior fundamentals, but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand. Ferrari’s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector. The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not meaningfully impacted by interest rates, inflation, or consumer credit conditions. For their customers, availability, allocation, and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations, . As a result, revenue stability, pricing power, and margins behave more like high-end luxury goods than cyclical vehicles. Order books remain deep, consistently extending beyond two years. Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts, allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game. Taking delivery of a less-desired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow. This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model, where customers accept less sought-after references to build credibility with the brand, and where the real product being sold is not the object itself but the access. Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of short-term sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance. Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches, but projected units, mix, and pricing still support the broader earnings profile. F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end, and the release does not carry long-term revenue consequences. The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals. The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestment/production reduction in EVs. This should be positive with the current political climate. Regardless, who tf wants a EV Ferrari? It should be easily priced at $500. The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead, I’m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly.

      "selftext_processed": "Here is a DD fellow window lickers . The Europoors have an investible asset for once . The pride of the Italian construction worker Dubai sheikh . Ferrari $ RACE The most profitable car company on earth by a % basis . Its business model demand dynamics and customer behavior place it closer to Hermès than to any massmarket OEM . Hermès trades at roughly fifty times trailing earnings while Ferrari trades closer to the midthirties at the moment . Based on trailing EPS a Hermèslevel earnings multiple would imply a share price roughly sixty percent higher than current levels . The gap is not_due to inferior fundamentals but because the market still partially misclassifies Ferrari as an auto manufacturer rather than a luxury scarcity brand . Ferrari ’ s demand profile is insulated from the typical macroeconomic pressures that affect the automotive sector . The company sells to high NW buyers whose purchasing power is not_meaningfully impacted by interest rates inflation or consumer credit conditions . For their customers availability allocation and status matter far more than financing rates or monthly payment considerations . As a result revenue stability pricing power and margins behave more like highend luxury goods than cyclical vehicles . Order books remain deep consistently extending beyond two years . Even in cases where a model receives mixed feedback from enthusiasts allocations sell out because buyers are playing a longer reputation game . Taking delivery of a lessdesired model today increases the probability of earning a rarified allocation tomorrow . This behavior mirrors the Patek Philippe model where customers accept less soughtafter references to build credibility with the brand and where the real product being sold is not_the object itself but the access . Recent analyst downgrades tied to the rollout cadence of the F80 are reflective of shortterm sentiment more than any deterioration in operational performance . Delivery expectations have shifted modestly on certain tranches but projected units mix and pricing still support the broader earnings profile . F80 demand remains oversubscribed at the high end and the release does not_carry longterm revenue consequences . The temporary softness in sentiment is a function of modeling timelines rather than weakening fundamentals . The tipping point for the recent stock slide was based on an underinvestmentproduction reduction in EVs . This should be positive with the current political climate . Regardless who tf wants a EV Ferrari It should be easily priced at $ 500 . The drawdown has stabilized with earning ahead I ’ m looking for a meaningful push into the low 400 shortly .

      "selftext": "I'm seriously thinking about dumping all my Bitcoin at a loss, but I want to make sure its a good idea first. I've been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24% loss for around 6 months or more, and I'm starting to think it was a bad investment. I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks. However, Bitcoin hasn't lived up to my expectations. I'll be honest, mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right, and up into the right is good lol, but now it isn't. Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation, mainly with major world banks buying it up. The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I, so I can't go against their game. Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock (I don't understand this too well I could be wrong). More and more I'm thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin. What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have? What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later? I know its obviously a currency, but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web. At least with gold and silver, you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry. Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar, since you can't really buy goods and services with silver and gold. But then again, maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver. I want to know what you guys think. I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not be seeing the whole picture.",

Ive been holding bitcoin at roughly a 24 % loss for around 6 months or more and Im starting to think it was a bad investment . I was expecting Bitcoin to be a hedge against possible US dollar devaluation and more continued interest in the expansion of Bitcoin investment vehicles like people being able to invest into it with their 401ks . However Bitcoin hasnt lived up to my expectations . Ill be honest mostly I invested in Bitcoin because the chart was going up into the right and up into the right is good lol but now it isnt . Silver and gold are doing the work of hedging against US dollar devaluation mainly with major world banks buying it up . The major banks have more power than every day people like you and I so I cant go against their game . Supposedly JP Morgan is keeping the price of Bitcoin down with them shorting Microstrategy stock I dont understand this too well I could be wrong . More and more Im thinking Warren Buffet was right on Bitcoin . What intrinsic value does Bitcoin have What other major functions can you do with Bitcoin besides buying and holding and then selling later I know its obviously a currency but the only other major use case I know of for Bitcoin is buying drugs off the dark web . At least with gold and silver you can melt it down and make electronics and jewelry . Maybe things will change in the future and Bitcoin will become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar since you cant really buy goods and services with silver and gold . But then again maybe someone will come up with another electronic coin backed by gold and silver . I want to know what you guys think . I might have some misconstrued views on Bitcoin and may not_be seeing the whole picture ."

      "title": "Today is only the start of UNH and HUM's drop",
      "selftext": "I was following some of the threads regarding todays drop of UNH and HUM. It seemed like it was a reaction to the Medicare rate increase holding steady, however with so many republicans selling their shares earlier in the week I thought something else had to be going on. This 10% drop seems like an over reaction to a Medicare rate increase. I did some quick research with Gemini and I'm very concerned for UNH. UNH's primarily growth and profitability driver had always been Optum RX. The Trump administration is moving quickly to remove the \"middleman\", pharmacy margins and name brand drug profits. With the stagnant Medicare rates piling on top, guidance isn't going to look good for these healthcare companies. Added the 1 Trillion in Medicaid cuts I missed from OBBBA starting over the next few years. UNH May be able to price their way out of this but I took a quick loss on my AH purchase and won't be holding through tomorrow. There is too much conflict and risk for what i perceive to be a small return here in the next 1-2 years. Edit: Not sure why this was downvoted so much but I'll add insider sells [ **\\*\\*\\*H.R. 7148** On January 22, 2026, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2026 (H.R. 7148). This bill contains core elements of the PBM Reform Act. **Delinking:** It prohibits PBM compensation in Medicare Part D from being tied to the list price of a drug. This effectively ends the incentive for PBMs to prefer higher-priced drugs just to collect a larger percentage. **100% Rebate Pass-Through:** It requires PBMs to pass 100% of manufacturer rebates directly to plan sponsors (employers) and patients, rather than keeping a \"spread\" or \"kickback.\" **Ban on Spread Pricing:** The bill bans \"spread pricing\" in Medicaid, which is the practice where PBMs charge the government one price and pay the pharmacy a lower price, pocketing the difference. **\\*\\*\\*One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA)** Medicaid Cuts: Provisions in the 2026 budget (OBBBA) are estimated to cut Medicaid spending by nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. UNH, which has a massive Medicaid footprint, faces significant \"disenrollment risk\" as states tighten eligibility. **\\*\\*\\*The \"Showdown\" Meetings** There have been two major high-stakes meetings/hearings in the last 72 hours involving industry leaders: 1. **House Ways and Means Committee (January 26, 2026):** Just hours ago, CEOs from the nation’s largest health insurers and PBMs (including representation from **UnitedHealth/Optum**) testified before Congress. They were grilled on why consolidation has not led to lower premiums and were specifically challenged on \"abusing their authority\" to prioritize profits over patients. 2. **House Energy and Commerce Committee (January 22, 2026):** This hearing coincided with the House vote and focused on the \"PBM Mafia\" (a term used by Rep. Buddy Carter during the proceedings). Industry leaders were put on notice that the era of \"hidden fees\" is being legislated out of existence.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was following some of the threads regarding todays drop of UNH and HUM . It seemed like it was a reaction to the Medicare rate increase holding steady however with so many republicans selling their shares earlier in the week I thought something else had to be going on . This 10 % drop seems like an over reaction to a Medicare rate increase . I did some quick research with Gemini and Im very concerned for UNH . UNHs primarily growth and profitability driver had always been Optum RX . The Trump administration is moving quickly to remove the middleman pharmacy margins and name brand drug profits . With the stagnant Medicare rates piling on top guidance isnt going to look good for these healthcare companies . Added the 1 Trillion in Medicaid cuts I missed from OBBBA starting over the next few years . UNH May be able to price their way out of this but I took a quick loss on my AH purchase and wont be holding through tomorrow . There is too much conflict and risk for what i perceive to be a small return here in the next 12 years . Edit Not_sure why this was downvoted so much but Ill add insider sells H.R . 7148 On January 22 2026 the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2026 H.R . 7148 . This bill contains core elements of the PBM Reform Act . Delinking It prohibits PBM compensation in Medicare Part D from being tied to the list price of a drug . This effectively ends the incentive for PBMs to prefer higherpriced drugs just to collect a larger percentage . 100 % Rebate PassThrough It requires PBMs to pass 100 % of manufacturer rebates directly to plan sponsors employers and patients rather than keeping a spread or kickback . Ban on Spread Pricing The bill bans spread pricing in Medicaid which is the practice where PBMs charge the government one price and pay the pharmacy a lower price pocketing the difference . One Big Beautiful Bill Act OBBBA Medicaid Cuts Provisions in the 2026 budget OBBBA are estimated to cut Medicaid spending by nearly $ 1 trillion over the next decade . UNH which has a massive Medicaid footprint faces significant disenrollment risk as states tighten eligibility . The Showdown Meetings There have been two major highstakes meetingshearings in the last 72 hours involving industry leaders 1 . House Ways and Means Committee January 26 2026 Just hours ago CEOs from the nation ’ s largest health insurers and PBMs including representation from UnitedHealthOptum testified before Congress . They were grilled on why consolidation has not_led to lower premiums and were specifically challenged on abusing their authority to prioritize profits over patients . 2 . House Energy and Commerce Committee January 22 2026 This hearing coincided with the House vote and focused on the PBM Mafia a term used by Rep . Buddy Carter during the proceedings . Industry leaders were put on notice that the era of hidden fees is being legislated out of existence ."

      "selftext": "Been digging into Alphabet's financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative. This isn't investment advice, just my analysis. The headline numbers look great: Net income up 36% YoY to $100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $125.3B Stock up \\\\\\\\\\\\\\~65% in 2025 But here's what's getting buried: 1. Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63% ($32.3B → $52.5B) while cash on hand stayed flat at $23.5B. Net income is up, but FCF margin is declining. That's a red flag most screens won't catch. 2. Hidden leverage nobody talks about Long-term debt looks manageable at $10.9B. But capital lease obligations are $14.6B more than the debt itself. All those data centers aren't free. 3. Liquidity is shifting long-term at the worst time Short-term investments dropped from $86.9B to $72.2B while long-term investments increased. They're locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking. 4. AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Here's the contrarian take: AI-generated answers bypass traditional ad clicks. Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue, but it could redistribute value within Google's ecosystem rather than expand it. 5. Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9% YoY. If those AI/Cloud contracts have delayed payment milestones, working capital strain could hit during any downturn. 6. Governance risk is real Dual-class structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want. Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy. Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings. If you're a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals. There are tools to surface these kinds of non-obvious risks. Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into Alphabets financials and wanted to share some findings that go beyond the surface level bullish narrative . This isnt investment advice just my analysis . The headline numbers look great Net income up 36 % YoY to $ 100.1B Operating cash flow jumped to $ 125.3B Stock up 65 % in 2025 But heres whats getting buried 1 . Free Cash Flow is compressing despite higher earnings CapEx jumped 63 % $ 32.3B → $ 52.5B while cash on hand stayed flat at $ 23.5B . Net income is up but FCF margin is declining . Thats a red flag most screens wont catch . 2 . Hidden leverage nobody_talks about Longterm debt looks manageable at $ 10.9B . But capital lease obligations are $ 14.6B more than the debt itself . All those data centers arent free . 3 . Liquidity is shifting longterm at the worst time Shortterm investments dropped from $ 86.9B to $ 72.2B while longterm investments increased . Theyre locking up liquidity right when CapEx is peaking . 4 . AI might cannibalize before it monetizes Heres the contrarian take AIgenerated answers bypass traditional ad clicks . Investors are pricing AI as additive revenue but it could redistribute value within Googles ecosystem rather than expand it . 5 . Receivables growing at revenue pace Receivables up 9 % YoY . If those AICloud contracts have delayed payment milestones working capital strain could hit during any downturn . 6 . Governance risk is real Dualclass structure means founders maintain control regardless of what shareholders want . Limited influence on capital allocation or dividend policy . Finding this stuff took hours of digging through filings . If youre a value investor tired of fragmented research and information overload causing you to miss risk signals . There are tools to surface these kinds of nonobvious risks . Anyone else concerned about the CapEx ramp or see it differently"

      "selftext": "By all means gold and silver have had an extraordinary run and I congratulate all the people who've made so much off of it, but after the blow-off top today, it's time to sell out and take profits. Gold and silver have risen to a point that they are extremely overvalued and their rise have been mostly fueled by speculation of the President of the United States doing a poor job. Here are the facts - according to recent economic data, the economy has been accelerating in comparison to 2024, not slowing, and according to J Powell himself, there have been no clear detrimental effects of the tariffs on the economy besides a one-time rise in prices, the cost of which would be offset by a $2,000 stimulus set to be paid to working class Americans later this year. When the economic impact of President Trump's agenda becomes even more apparent, the prices of Gold and Silver will collapse as the US enters an economic golden age. The world will find out that Trump is actually bringing peace and stability to the world through his negotiations that have already ended over half a dozen wars and freed the Venezuelan people from the oppression of the Maduro regime and unlocking the largest oil reserves to the global market, strengthening global energy security. When the world finds out that the fears about Trump are unsubstantiated, the prices of gold and silver will collapse and US equities will once again be the outperformers.",

Gold and silver have risen to a point that they are extremely overvalued and their rise have been mostly fueled by speculation of the President of the United States doing a poor job . Here are the facts according to recent economic data the economy has been accelerating in comparison to 2024 not_slowing and according to J Powell himself there have been no_clear detrimental effects of the tariffs on the economy besides a onetime rise in prices the cost of which would be offset by a $ 2000 stimulus set to be paid to working class Americans later this year . When the economic impact of President Trumps agenda becomes even more apparent the prices of Gold and Silver will collapse as the US enters an economic golden age . The world will find out that Trump is actually bringing peace and stability to the world through his negotiations that have already ended over half a dozen wars and freed the Venezuelan people from the oppression of the Maduro regime and unlocking the largest oil reserves to the global market strengthening global energy security . When the world finds out that the fears about Trump are unsubstantiated the prices of gold and silver will collapse and US equities will once again be the outperformers ."

Used it to analyse sector rotation patterns across 27 years of S&P 500 sector ETF data. --- **Methodology** - **Data:** S&P 500 Sector SPDR ETFs (XLK, XLE, XLF, XLV, XLY, XLP, XLI, XLB, XLU, XLRE, XLC) - **Period:** 1999-2026 (XLRE from 2015, XLC from 2018) - **Approach:** Rank all sectors by annual return, track year-over-year transitions, count reversals **Why ETFs, not stock averages:** Market-cap weighted. A $3T company has more influence than a $100M micro-cap. I initially used FMP's sector_performance data (simple averages) but got garbage. +73% single-day sector returns from micro-cap noise. ETFs reflect actual investable returns. --- **Results** | Metric | Count | |:-------|:------| | Total year-over-year transitions | 246 | | Bottom-3 → Top-3 next year | 27 (11%) | | Top-3 → Bottom-3 next year | 34 (14%) | | Major reversals (either direction) | 61 (25%) | No sector stayed #1 for more than 2 consecutive years. --- **Recent rankings (2024-2026)** | Year | #1 | #2 | #3 | Worst | |:-----|:---|:---|:---|:------| | 2024 | Comm Services (+36%) | Financials | Consumer Disc | Materials (0%) | | 2025 | Technology (+25%) | Comm Services | Industrials | Utilities (-43%) | | 2026 YTD | Materials (+7%) | Energy | Consumer Staples | Financials (-2%) | Materials: worst in 2024, leading 2026 YTD.

A family is considering allocating $1–2 million into a long-term investment vehicle with the objective of generating a sustainable \\~5% annual return while preserving capital. What types of instruments or structures would be appropriate to achieve this goal over a long time horizon? EDIT: Sorry if my post sounded confusing. Background is that I would like to secure my family's future and organize some sort of trust fund or something like that so we would have some sort of passive income. I now use CDs but the rates are not great and they will probably go lower. I want to keep 5% at min, and I would like to increase the asset base (insh) in the coming years. So that's the background. I am not familiar with any firms or advisors, so I think I will talk to Schwab or someone similar. Anyone who gave advice, I am greatful. I am a trader and I have been in the markets since 2013. Actively since 2017, and I am 42. So trying to plan my fams future. That's it. Don't want to take market risk, as I have plenty of capital under risk daily anyways.",

It’s @ 4.80 yesterday was 6.00. 2: PL 36 Call EXP: May.15.2026 bought for 2.85 It’s @ 2.10 yesterday was 2.80. Personally I love this company and will be investing long term. If you guys can help that would be great but no pressure. My question is 1) How bad would PL be affected by the government shutdown If it happens, I imagine pretty bad right? 2) If a government shutdown occurs that would lead me to believe we entered a bearish market? 3) Should I just sell or hold? I don’t mind selling and I am more worried about waiting. Hope you guys/gals have a good one!",

      "selftext": "Looks like he's not done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada. Load up on your stocks boys because it'll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow [From NBC]( President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25% from 15%, complaining that the nation's legislature wasn't \"living up\" to a trade deal that was struck last year. \"Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%,\" Trump wrote in a social media post. Trump's announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living. His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation, and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties. South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States, ranking among the top 10 sources of imports. Nearly $150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers. In July, Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Korea's president. However, the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for. Then in October, during Trump's Asia trip, he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal, which included a promise of investing $350 billion in the U.S. Weeks later, in November, the White House and South Korean government released a \"fact sheet\" that was set to put the deal in motion. [Edit] For anyone interested, in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense, I've setup r/TrumpTariffTracker. Any help setting it up is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "Looks like hes not_done trying to rally gold after his weekend threat against Canada . Load up on your stocks boys because itll be TACO Tuesday tomorrow From NBC President Donald Trump said Monday that he was hiking tariffs on imports from South Korea to 25 % from 15 % complaining that the nations legislature wasnt living up to a trade deal that was struck last year . Because the Korean Legislature hasnt enacted our Historic Trade Agreement which is their prerogative I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos Lumber Pharma and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS from 15 % to 25 % Trump wrote in a social media post . Trumps announcement comes as he also contends with blowback from voters on affordability and the cost of living . His tariffs have contributed to stubborn price inflation and recent research says consumers have shouldered nearly all of costs from the duties . South Korea is an important trading partner for the United States ranking among the top 10 sources of imports . Nearly $ 150 billion worth of goods is imported every year from South Korea to the U.S. by companies and consumers . In July Trump reached what he called a trade deal with South Koreas president . However the two sides then remained deadlocked for months over an investment pledge that the U.S. pushed for . Then in October during Trumps Asia trip he and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung finalized that deal which included a promise of investing $ 350 billion in the U.S . Weeks later in November the White House and South Korean government released a fact sheet that was set to put the deal in motion . Edit For anyone interested in an attempt to keep track of the tariff nonsense Ive setup rTrumpTariffTracker . Any help setting it up is appreciated ."

Was it because the threat resolved itself before today or is it because the market finally knows what we all do the threats are hollow and shortlived I guess well find out after next weekends threat ."

      "selftext": "There's something truly different about gold/metals ATH right now. As many have pointed out, these are safe haven assets. When there is turmoil in the world, when the value of government currencies are uncertain, equities are uncertain, this is where the money flows. Can't make more of it, no government can affect it, can hold, can travel. EDIT Previous highs, like the 70's, functioned in this way. Gold at all time highs. Equities in the cellar, bonds in the cellar. The dollar was weak and losing credibility — that's what drove gold up. Critically, central banks weren't buying gold back then — many were selling or holding, believing the price had gotten too high. The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation. Eventually, Volcker jacked rates to 20%, which crushed inflation, strengthened the dollar, and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back. Gold then entered a 20-year bear market, with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s (most famously, the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999). In the 70's we were in stagflation (high inflation low growth) in the US though, so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation, but inflation remained high and growth was low... so demand for t bills was still weak, high inflation. So the fed made a crazy move - pegged interest to 20%. This killed inflation, and brought strong interest back to the dollar, and gold went into a 20 year decline. They can't do that anymore. The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP. How do we service that debt? We issue more bonds. If those bonds paid 20%, we'd go bankrupt. So back to the beginning, what's special about right now. We have never had this situation. Equities are near all time highs. CAPE, which measures P/E ratio of the market, is over 40 for the second time in history, implying very high valuations. The buffet factor, which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224%, the highest ever. And we know metals are also at ATH's. What is happening? Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates, but in the 90's, Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick. Treasury issues bonds. Fed buys them. They just create the money and give it to the treasury. They collect payments. Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury. US does this the most, but everyone has allowed it because there's no better currency. When COVID hit, the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession. In one month, they bought $1.3T of bonds (April 2020). They agree to buy $120B per month thereafter. In the last five years, the money in the world has increased from $15T >>> $22T. This is unprecedented, and rightfully so, countries' central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if they're just going apeshit printing money. (Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP \"loans\" that were forgiven --->> all that extra money drove up equities, properties, groceries... it's the root of the hyper inflation.) Ok we're almost there. 2022. Russia invades Ukraine. US freezes $300B of Russia's dollars. OH shit the dollar isn't what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they don't like us they can just cancel it. Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy. Instead of buying \\~400 tons of gold per year (about 12% of demand) they started buying 1200 tons - 25% of demand in 2024. Now they are buying 900. They are only buying less because the price is up, they don't care about the price they are buying anyway. Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price. Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are, and industry can't buy less. They are buying less treasury bonds. So the dollar has fallen 15% in the last year. Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar. So why would this stop? US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill. Which means more t bills, and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply. They can't raise interest rates like the 70's. If stagflation hits (low growth, high unemployment AND high inflation) we are fucked. Remember our clever friend Japan? Well they just kept buying their t bills. Then they started buying nikkei stocks too. They hold 226% of their gdp in debt, interest is zero, and the yen is cratering. (One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now, FYI.) Stocks WILL drop - who knows when exactly, but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era, we're at 40+. Oh and another record - $1.3T of those stocks are leveraged. When the drop happens where is the safe haven now? Dollar is no longer safe haven. This is why I think gold, silver, platinum could double again. Side note: as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too. Signs are already there - in October is started behaving a little differently - it's not a high risk asset that should track equities, it's a safety asset. Quantum computing the core risk there IMO.",

      "selftext_processed": "Theres something truly different about goldmetals ATH right now . As many have pointed out these are safe haven assets . When there is turmoil in the world when the value of government currencies are uncertain equities are uncertain this is where the money flows . Cant make more of it no_government can affect it can hold can travel . EDIT Previous highs like the 70s functioned in this way . Gold at all time highs . Equities in the cellar bonds in the cellar . The dollar was weak and losing credibility — thats what drove gold up . Critically central banks werent buying gold back then — many were selling or holding believing the price had gotten too high . The rally was driven purely by private investors panicking about inflation . Eventually Volcker jacked rates to 20 % which crushed inflation strengthened the dollar and brought strong demand for US treasury bills back . Gold then entered a 20year bear market with central banks continuing to sell throughout the 80s and 90s most famously the UK dumped half its reserves at the bottom in 1999 . In the 70s we were in stagflation high inflation low growth in the US though so interest rates were rising to try to limit inflation but inflation remained high and growth was low ... so demand for t bills was still weak high inflation . So the fed made a crazy move pegged interest to 20 % . This killed inflation and brought strong interest back to the dollar and gold went into a 20 year decline . They cant do that anymore . The US has gotten into a situation where the treasury needs to service debt more than a third of our annual GDP . How do we service that debt We issue more bonds . If those bonds paid 20 % wed go bankrupt . So back to the beginning whats special about right now . We have never_had this situation . Equities are near all time highs . CAPE which measures PE ratio of the market is over 40 for the second time in history implying very high valuations . The buffet factor which compares GDP to the value of stocks is at 224 % the highest ever . And we know metals are also at ATHs . What is happening Everyone knows the fed sets interest rates but in the 90s Japan taught all the feds around the world a new trick . Treasury issues bonds . Fed buys them . They just create the money and give it to the treasury . They collect payments . Then they send the interest collected back to the treasury . US does this the most but everyone has allowed it because theres no_better currency . When COVID hit the fed kicked this into high gear to prevent recession . In one month they bought $ 1.3T of bonds April 2020 . They agree to buy $ 120B per month thereafter . In the last five years the money in the world has increased from $ 15T $ 22T . This is unprecedented and rightfully so countries central banks were feeling like the dollar may be a little less safe if theyre just going apeshit printing money . Also that COVID money went straight to people via stimulus checks and PPP loans that were forgiven all that extra money drove up equities properties groceries ... its the root of the hyper inflation . Ok were almost there . 2022 . Russia invades Ukraine . US freezes $ 300B of Russias dollars . OH shit the dollar isnt what it used to be they are printing it like mad and if they dont like us they can just cancel it . Central banks changed their rainy day fund strategy . Instead of buying 400 tons of gold per year about 12 % of demand they started buying 1200 tons 25 % of demand in 2024 . Now they are buying 900 . They are only buying less because the price is up they dont care about the price they are buying anyway . Jewelry is still buying the same 1200 tons regardless of price . Retail is buying 1000 tons because of the same reason central banks are and industry cant buy less . They are buying less treasury bonds . So the dollar has fallen 15 % in the last year . Tariffs just making it worse for the dollar . So why would this stop US deficit just got way bigger with the big beautiful bill . Which means more t bills and the interest rate is starting to divorce from fed rate changes because there is too much supply . They cant raise interest rates like the 70s . If stagflation hits low growth high unemployment AND high inflation we are fucked . Remember our clever friend Japan Well they just kept buying their t bills . Then they started buying nikkei stocks too . They hold 226 % of their gdp in debt interest is zero and the yen is cratering . One of the only places to take your dollar on vacation right now FYI . Stocks WILL drop who knows when exactly but the highest CAPE ever was 44 in the dotcom era were at 40 . Oh and another record $ 1.3T of those stocks are leveraged . When the drop happens where is the safe haven now Dollar is no_longer safe haven . This is why I think gold silver platinum could double again . Side note as soon as the world accepts bitcoin does in fact check every box gold does in these situations I think it goes apeshit too . Signs are already there in October is started behaving a little differently its not_a high risk asset that should track equities its a safety asset . Quantum computing the core risk there IMO ."

The layoffs, which are in addition to the 1,000 corporate job cuts the company announced last summer, primarily impact distribution center roles in Tennessee and Mississippi, where the sneaker giant operates large warehouses, people familiar with the matter said. In a statement to CNBC, Nike said the layoffs primarily affect its U.S. distribution operations and are designed to “reduce complexity, improve flexibility, and build a more responsive, resilient, responsible, and efficient operation.” “We’re taking steps to strengthen and streamline our operations so we can move faster, operate with greater discipline, and better serve athletes and consumers,” Nike said in the statement. “We are sharpening our supply chain footprint, accelerating the use of advanced technology and automation, and investing in the skills our teams need for the future.” Source: [",

Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back. I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds.

Plan is to somehow invest their money and convince them to move back . I was thinking putting the money into money markets and bonds . Apologies for the word vomit and a subsequent rant . would appreciate any advice ."

      "selftext": "TLDR: in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photos/videos would be deleted in September 2026. Users were outraged; investors seem to think it will flop. But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise: I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat+ ($5/mo standard rate)... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat+. This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends. Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data. That’s how I got to 13k+ total friends of friends. “Other Revenue” from the Q3 2025 10-Q was $189M and stated as “majority coming from Snapchat+”. It accounted for 9% of total revenue. According to demandsage (dot) com, Snapchat+ had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report. **477M Daily Active Users -> 3.56% of DAUs were subscribed. At 900M Monthly Users -> 1.88% of MAUs were subscribed** (MAUs may be a more effective metric. See end). **And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue.** **Sources of Error:** * “Total users” from the polling includes inactive accounts. This is why I suspect Snap+/MAUs is a better comparison than DAUs (the Snapchat+ rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample). * Snapchat Platinum ($15/mo) and the cheaper storage option ($2/mo) are both excluded. * Subscription rates (as a percentage of users) could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date (Sep 2026) approaches. * Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly. **Of course, the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base.** **And that’s where the regard army comes in.** Help me take this from 13k to 100k+ datapoints. Regards, I call upon thee! **HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT+** Step 1: Go to your profile and tap on the “Try Snapchat+” button at the top. NOTE: Only appears for users who don’t have Snapchat+. Step 2: Write down the circled number. If it doesn’t appear, restart the app and try again. **HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT:** Step 1: Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2: Search for “How many” and click the first filter. Write down the number above your head. **Please put your stats in the comments!** If you include your age and rough location, I’ll add your data to my dataset. My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat+ users. **DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR in September Snapchat announced that users with more than 5GB of memories would have to start paying on a monthly basis or their excess photosvideos would be deleted in September 2026 . Users were outraged investors seem to think it will flop . But I manually collected data that suggests otherwise I was using Snapchat last weekend when I tapped on my memories and discovered that Snapchat gave me a figure for how many of my friends are already subscribed to Snapchat $ 5mo standard rate ... So I started asking everyone on my friends list to tell me how many total friends they have vs how many of their friends subscribe to Snapchat . This got me to 5.5k total friends of friends . Then I hopped on Omegle for a few hours and asked a bunch of strangers for their data . That ’ s how I got to 13k total friends of friends . “ Other Revenue ” from the Q3 2025 10Q was $ 189M and stated as “ majority coming from Snapchat ” . It accounted for 9 % of total revenue . According to demandsage dot com Snapchat had 17M subscribers as of the Q3 Earnings report . 477M Daily Active Users 3.56 % of DAUs were subscribed . At 900M Monthly Users 1.88 % of MAUs were subscribed MAUs may be a more effective metric . See end . And Subscription revenue is often valued twice as much as ad revenue . Sources of Error “ Total users ” from the polling includes inactive accounts . This is why I suspect SnapMAUs is a better comparison than DAUs the Snapchat rate as a percentage of DAUs could be higher than the sample . Snapchat Platinum $ 15mo and the cheaper storage option $ 2mo are both excluded . Subscription rates as a percentage of users could go up even more over the year as the memory deletion date Sep 2026 approaches . Snap gives discounts when buying annually as opposed to monthly . Of course the sample size is only a fraction of the total user base . And that ’ s where the regard army comes in . Help me take this from 13k to 100k datapoints . Regards I call upon thee HOW TO FIND HOW MANY FRIENDS HAVE SNAPCHAT Step 1 Go to your profile and tap on the “ Try Snapchat ” button at the top . NOTE Only appears for users who don ’ t have Snapchat . Step 2 Write down the circled number . If it doesn ’ t appear restart the app and try again . HOW TO FIND YOUR TOTAL FRIEND COUNT Step 1 Click this smiley face in the bottom right of the main screen Step 2 Search for “ How many ” and click the first filter . Write down the number above your head . Please put your stats in the comments If you include your age and rough location I ’ ll add your data to my dataset . My hunch is that older folks will have lower total friend count and percent of snapchat users . DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH"

      "selftext": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU (Nvidia) and the HBM (SK Hynix/Micron), ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer. Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027. The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies. To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called \"T-Glass\"), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply. Taiwas Glass ) spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the \"T-Glass\" recipe. They just approved a $2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn. Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk. Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya). The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news. Nittobo (Japan) didn't stop at a 2x; it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock. As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division (likely Q1/Q2 2026), the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock. \\*\\*TLDR\\*\\* Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027. Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them. I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind. Corp. (1802.TW)",

      "selftext_processed": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU Nvidia and the HBM SK HynixMicron ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer . Entire AI supply chain from Blackwell to Apple ’ s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly . And they are sold out until 2027 . The general assumption is that an H100Blackwell GPU is just silicon but the chip sits on a substrate that green board . If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow the chip cracks and dies . To prevent warping you need Low CTE Glass often called TGlass which is currently manufactured by Nittobo Japan which is currently sold out hence AppleQualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply . Taiwas Glass spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the TGlass recipe . They just approved a $ 2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn . Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ . They need a second source to reduce risk . Also they are the only non Chinese option . US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives and Nittobo is maxed out . Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers Unimicron Nan Ya . The stock is up 200 % over the last year but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news . Nittobo Japan didnt stop at a 2x it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock . As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division likely Q1Q2 2026 the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock . TLDR Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027 . Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them . I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind . Corp. 1802.TW"

      "selftext": "I am in love with the stock market and I recently came up with (what I think may be) a fun idea: A website/app for ranked trading and investing. Here's the rundown: \\- You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio \\- There will be daily, weekly, monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return. \\-From there it's simple, outperform 90% of other investors in the time period? You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights. Blow 100% of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage? You get a low rank and get shamed by other users. Personally, I think this will be great, it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive. I do have some other ideas as well, however these do stray a little from the core of the idea: \\- Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks \\- Built in news tab \\- A daily quiz about recent news, where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws. \\- Built-in trading companions to win prizes. I'm really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen. If there's any feedback you have please let me know in the comments.",

Heres the rundown You connect your broker account or manually input all positions to track your portfolio There will be daily weekly monthly and YTD leaderboards based on your return . From there its simple outperform 90 % of other investors in the time period You get a high rank and officially earn bragging rights . Blow 100 % of your portfolio buying penny stocks with 1000x leverage You get a low rank and get shamed by other users . Personally I think this will be great it gamifies the stock market and allows you and your friends to get a little more competitive . I do have some other ideas as well however these do stray a little from the core of the idea Social feed to share ideas on your stock picks Built in news tab A daily quiz about recent news where correct answers grant you entries into prize draws . Builtin trading companions to win prizes . Im really excited about this idea and I would love to make it happen . If theres any feedback you have please let me know in the comments ."

      "title": "BMBL struggles with revenue decline despite cost cuts and balance sheet improvements",
      "selftext": "Bumble Inc BMBL has been trading near multiyear lows recently, around 3.55 to 3.60 USD, reflecting pressure from declining revenue and changing user metrics. Over the past year, the stock has fallen sharply from previous highs, while management has taken steps to cut costs and improve financial flexibility. For context, Q3 2025 revenue came in at about 246.2 million USD, down roughly 10 percent year over year, with Bumble App revenue declining to 199 million USD per last 10-Q. Earlier quarters showed similar trends, with Q1 2025 revenue around 247 million USD, also down compared to prior periods. Total paying users have decreased slightly, though management is focusing on engagement quality and product updates to stabilize this metric. On the cost side, Bumble reduced its global workforce by approximately 240 positions in early 2025, representing about 30 percent of staff, which management expects to generate roughly 40 million USD in annualized savings. The company also settled a tax receivable obligation at a discount, paying 186 million USD versus a 419 million USD carrying value. This move improves long-term flexibility, although user growth and revenue trends remain headwinds. Leadership changes have also shaped recent strategy. CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd returned in early 2025 to guide the company, and the Chief Product Officer recently departed as part of a reorganization under a single product leader. These moves indicate a focus on streamlining decision-making and product execution. From a trading perspective, BMBL has shown elevated volatility around earnings reports and announcements, with technical support near multiyear lows around 3.50 USD and resistance near prior highs in the 4.50–5.00 USD range. Volume has been uneven, suggesting cautious participation from investors. Long-term considerations include the strength of the Bumble brand in online dating and the potential for engagement and monetization improvements, balanced against revenue declines, reduced paying users, and ongoing competition in the social and dating app market. Execution on product updates and user retention will be critical to any recovery. Not financial advice. This is a neutral summary based on recent filings and public news. Do you think BMBL can stabilize revenue and user metrics with these changes, or is the declining trend likely to continue?",

      "selftext": "If you want to last, **cheat the institutions**. Not by fighting them. By **observing them**. Tether purchased 27 tons of gold in the fourth quarter of 2025, with the acquisition currently valued at approximately $4.4 billion according to Reuters. This purchase follows a 26-ton acquisition in Q3 2025, bringing Tether's total reported gold holdings to over 140 tons. In the same quarter, Tether also acquired 8,888 Bitcoin worth about $850 million. We can talk all day about strategies, indicators, setups. But one thing is certain: institutions don’t just set the direction, they almost always **hold the best cards**. They see it first. They position first. And most importantly, they never get attached to a narrative. While many were still debating, **gold printed a new ATH at 5100**. And that didn’t happen by accident. Tether, on its side, positioned itself **at the right time**: 27 tons of gold bought in Q4 2025. No tweet. No speech. Just action. Now, with the current headlines, I honestly think this is **only the beginning**. Intel stock took its share, dropping -17% in a single day. At that point, it became very clear to me that I had made the right decision by getting out and focusing only on the short term, using Bitget Stock Futures for easy entries, trading long or short Temporarily. The entire market could react even worse with what’s coming: tariffs, politics, macro, liquidity. And that’s where my real questions begin: **Gold at 5100 is it still possible to enter?** **Is this really the right moment to take a position?**",

Booz Allen Hamilton’s stock price dropped by more than 10% on the heels of the Treasury Department’s announcement. > The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton, totaling $4.8 million in annual spending and $21 million in total obligations. “President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste, fraud, and abuse, and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans’ trust in government,” Bessent said in a statement. “Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data, including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service,” he said. > The department noted that between 2018 and 2020, Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn “stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers.” The data breach affected about 406,000 taxpayers, according to the IRS.",

The department said it currently has 31 separate contracts with Booz Allen Hamilton totaling $ 4.8 million in annual spending and $ 21 million in total obligations . “ President Trump has entrusted his cabinet to root out waste fraud and abuse and canceling these contracts is an essential step to increasing Americans ’ trust in government ” Bessent said in a statement . “ Booz Allen failed to implement adequate safeguards to protect sensitive data including the confidential taxpayer information it had access to through its contracts with the Internal Revenue Service ” he said . The department noted that between 2018 and 2020 Booz Allen employee Charles Edward Littlejohn “ stole and leaked the confidential tax returns and return information of hundreds of thousands of taxpayers. ” The data breach affected about 406000 taxpayers according to the IRS ."

      "selftext": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU (Nvidia) and the HBM (SK Hynix/Micron), ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer. Entire AI supply chain, from Blackwell to Apple’s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly. And they are sold out until 2027. The general assumption is that an H100/Blackwell GPU is just silicon, but the chip sits on a substrate (that green board). If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow, the chip cracks and dies. To prevent warping, you need Low CTE Glass (often called \"T-Glass\"), which is currently manufactured by Nittobo (Japan) which is currently sold out, hence Apple/Qualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply. Taiwas Glass ) spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the \"T-Glass\" recipe. They just approved a $2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn. Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ. They need a second source to reduce risk. Also, they are the only non Chinese option. US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives, and Nittobo is maxed out. Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers (Unimicron, Nan Ya). The stock is up 200% over the last year, but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news. Nittobo (Japan) didn't stop at a 2x; it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock. As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division (likely Q1/Q2 2026), the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock. \\*\\*TLDR\\*\\* Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027. Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them. I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind. Corp. (1802.TW)",

      "selftext_processed": "The market is currently fixated on the GPU Nvidia and the HBM SK HynixMicron ignoring a critical bottleneck in the advanced packaging layer . Entire AI supply chain from Blackwell to Apple ’ s M series is currently being choked by a specific type of fiberglass fabric that basically only one Japanese company knows how to make properly . And they are sold out until 2027 . The general assumption is that an H100Blackwell GPU is just silicon but the chip sits on a substrate that green board . If that board warps when it gets hot during reflow the chip cracks and dies . To prevent warping you need Low CTE Glass often called TGlass which is currently manufactured by Nittobo Japan which is currently sold out hence AppleQualcomm are now fighting NVIDIA for supply . Taiwas Glass spent the last two years retrofitting their furnaces to crack the TGlass recipe . They just approved a $ 2.25 Billion NTD expansion specifically for electronic grade yarn . Reports from DigiTimes and local supply chain checks confirm Nvidia and Unimicron execs have been at Taiwan Glass HQ . They need a second source to reduce risk . Also they are the only non Chinese option . US sanctions block the mainland Chinese alternatives and Nittobo is maxed out . Taiwan Glass is right next door to the substrate packagers Unimicron Nan Ya . The stock is up 200 % over the last year but that was just insider accumulation front running the qualification news . Nittobo Japan didnt stop at a 2x it pulled a 5 bagger once it was fully priced as an AI stock . As soon as Taiwasn Glass reports meaningful revenue from the electronic materials division likely Q1Q2 2026 the algos will have to rerate this as a tech material stock . TLDR Entire AI GPU industry is dependent on ultrarigid glass fabric which only one Japanese company knows how to make perfectly and it is already sold out till 2027 . Taiwan Glass is their new competitor and is already engaged with NVIDIA in talks to buy from them . I am 15k shares long on Taiwan Glass Ind . Corp. 1802.TW"

      "title": "$NOW (ServiceNow): premium valuation, but elite fundamentals",
      "selftext": "($NOW) and I’m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names. A few fundamentals that stand out to me: • \\~20–21% subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98% • Non-GAAP operating margin above 30% • Strong free cash flow generation (\\~30%+ FCF margin annually) • RPO and cRPO both growing >20% YoY, giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn’t an “AI hype” story. AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows (IT, HR, finance, customer operations) that companies already rely on. These are mission-critical systems with high switching costs, which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts. Valuation is clearly premium, so this isn’t a cheap stock. But the combination of durable growth, margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a long-term compounder than a short-term trade. I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum. Curious how others here see $NOW: • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce? • Any long-term risks I might be underestimating? Not investment advice, just sharing research and looking for different perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ NOW and I ’ m curious why it gets relatively little attention compared to more visible AI or semiconductor names . A few fundamentals that stand out to me • 20–21 % subscription revenue growth at large scale • Renewal rate consistently around 97–98 % • NonGAAP operating margin above 30 % • Strong free cash flow generation 30 % FCF margin annually • RPO and cRPO both growing 20 % YoY giving solid revenue visibility What I like is that this isn ’ t an “ AI hype ” story . AI is embedded into existing enterprise workflows IT HR finance customer operations that companies already rely on . These are missioncritical systems with high switching costs which explains the low churn and steady expansion within accounts . Valuation is clearly premium so this isn ’ t a cheap stock . But the combination of durable growth margin expansion and predictable cash flow makes it look more like a longterm compounder than a shortterm trade . I recently started building a position and plan to add on pullbacks rather than chase momentum . Curious how others here see $ NOW • Worth the premium vs peers like Salesforce • Any longterm risks I might be underestimating Not_investment advice just sharing research and looking for different perspectives ."

      "selftext": "Spent a long time hand picking these by going one by one through thinkorswim and looking for solid companies that have bottomed and are showing strong Nikki’s momentum going forward. Each has a great near term opportunity but would also be good long term holds. Options are cheaper here than other popular names from social media and offer a higher near term upside. Good luck out there. Worked hard on this. ACN: Accenture plc Accenture is making strong progress with AI, showing a 10% year-over-year increase in managed services and better operating margins expected in fiscal 2026. The technical indicators also suggest potential for further gains, supported by solid volume and momentum. ADP: Automatic Data Processing ADP is a reliable performer with consistent earnings and dividends, setting up for about 31% total returns in 2026 due to steady growth and an attractive entry point from recent market dips. AJG: Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. Gallagher continues to grow through acquisitions, with organic expansion and likely earnings beats ahead. Analysts anticipate positive results next week, reinforced by a favorable overall outlook. BIIB: Biogen Inc. Biogen’s pipeline is advancing, including EU approval for a high-dose version of Spinraza, which strengthens the positive outlook. Combined with stable earnings and a recent 9% stock rise, it points to recovery potential. BRO: Brown & Brown, Inc. Brown & Brown maintains steady organic growth, enhanced by a new healthcare platform and a recent dividend increase. These developments should bolster the positive case moving forward. CHDN: Churchill Downs Incorporated Churchill Downs benefits from its strong brand and investments in luxury experiences like Derby suites, along with share buybacks that have reduced outstanding shares by 30% over the past decade. Analysts expect a higher valuation from new track developments. CLX: The Clorox Company Clorox is trading at an attractive 16 times forward earnings, given its over 35% return on invested capital. The lower multiples offer value, and consistent demand for household essentials should drive a recovery. CMG: Chipotle Mexican Grill Chipotle’s long-term potential remains clear despite economic challenges, with strong operations and a reset in valuation creating an opportunity to buy. The focus is on continued growth beyond temporary issues like reduced customer traffic. CNC: Centene Corporation Centene appears undervalued at current multiples, with stable earnings and the possibility of trading at 14 times 2026 earnings per share. While there are government-related risks, improvements in margins could shift sentiment positively. CPRT: Copart, Inc. Copart holds a leading position in global auctions with over 300,000 buyers ensuring strong liquidity advantages, high margins, and sustainable growth. Its careful cash management supports a solid positive outlook. DECK: Deckers Outdoor Corporation Deckers could see sales growth if lower interest rates encourage consumer spending in 2026. Even with cautious guidance, the brand’s resilience and undervaluation suggest significant potential upside. FDS: FactSet Research Systems FactSet’s first-quarter margins and a win with Barclays highlight improving profitability, while momentum indicators point to long-term gains. Ongoing revenue and earnings growth maintain the positive perspective. IT: Gartner, Inc. Gartner’s leading market position and recurring revenue provide stability, despite some AI-related concerns. The expectation is for accelerated growth through its advisory strengths after any short-term setbacks. LIN: Linde plc Linde has a backlog of $7 to $10 billion in long-term contracts, supporting over 10% earnings per share growth. Analysts remain positive about its consistent expansion and long-term compounding ability. MCK: McKesson Corporation McKesson seems undervalued by about 41% based on discounted cash flow analysis, with ongoing benefits from GLP-1 trends into 2026. Its strong performance over recent years indicates room for further progress. MOH: Molina Healthcare, Inc. Molina shows strength in its Marketplace segment, and recent investments like those from Michael Burry add to the appeal. Growth through premiums and acquisitions supports a positive view in the healthcare sector. MRSH: Marsh & McLennan Companies Marsh & McLennan is projected for 8.6% earnings per share growth and rising revenues, positioning it as a consistent performer. Analysts view any adjustments as temporary, with sustained gains expected. MSI: Motorola Solutions, Inc. Motorola Solutions is seeing growth in tactical communications, along with analyst upgrades. Even at normalized valuations, there appears to be potential for additional increases in this key area. NFLX: Netflix, Inc. Netflix demonstrates solid margins and fourth-quarter results that affirm its growth path. Analysts expect continued subscriber additions and AI initiatives to maintain its premium status. NOW: ServiceNow, Inc. ServiceNow’s AI efforts could generate over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue by 2026, attracting hedge funds and positive analyst views. Despite a 28% decline, the setup suggests a possible rebound. ORLY: O’Reilly Automotive O’Reilly benefits from steady demand and substantial share buybacks, paving the way for earnings growth in 2026. Analysts are optimistic, with trends indicating continued progress. PANW: Palo Alto Networks Palo Alto Networks is approaching a positive trendline that could lead to gains in 2026, supported by buy ratings from analysts. Demand for AI and cybersecurity keeps its competitive advantages strong. PAYX: Paychex, Inc. Paychex looks undervalued with expected revenue growth ahead. A partnership with PayPal enhances sentiment, targeting potential upside to $133 based on its recurring business model. PSN: Parsons Corporation Parsons is shifting toward defense and securing contracts like New Murabba, with U.S.-Qatar agreements adding support. Commercial successes and momentum reinforce the positive outlook. REGN: Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron’s recovery is building with contributions from Dupixent and Libtayo, plus upcoming pipeline developments in 2026. Earnings surprises and undervaluation make it an appealing choice. RSG: Republic Services, Inc. Republic Services has a track record of earnings surprises and a strong competitive position for potential beats. Its multi-year performance suggests attractive entry points for long-term investors. STLA: Stellantis N.V. Stellantis has been upgraded to overweight, with leadership changes and $13 billion in U.S. investments aimed at sales recovery by 2026. The current dip presents value opportunities. STZ: Constellation Brands Constellation’s beer business is performing well, with margins recovering after one-time issues. Analysts see current fluctuations as chances to invest for growth in 2026. TEAM: Atlassian Corporation Atlassian’s AI capabilities and over 19% revenue growth outperform peers, with effective execution opening up further potential. Its collaboration tools are expected to lead the market. TRI: Thomson Reuters Thomson Reuters targets 7.5 to 8% organic growth in 2026, accelerated by AI and acquisitions. The buy rating reflects confidence in its ongoing profitability. TROX: Tronox Holdings plc Tronox has risen 47%, with analysts raising targets to $6, indicating optimism. While growth may be moderate, the pricing supports potential for gains. UNH: UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth could return to all-time highs in 2026 through adjustments in care ratios, with undervaluation suggesting upside to over $400 per share in positive scenarios. VRSK: Verisk Analytics, Inc. Verisk’s core strengths outweigh short-term concerns, with growth and high margins driving buy recommendations. Long-term profitability appears secure despite recent dips. WIX: Wix.com Ltd. Wix’s AI-powered website builder and partnerships are driving growth, with its under $5 billion valuation offering asymmetric opportunities. The potential for expansion looks promising .",

      "selftext": "I landed an analyst role at a small but ambitious firm. What I’ve seen there has honestly confused me. I’m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn’t hold up in the real world. This firm isn’t focused on the usual private equity, venture capital, or hedge fund activities. They’re not betting on growth stories, turnarounds, or “great management teams.” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea: Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own. Not “undervalued future potential.” Not “great product, bad quarter.” It’s literally cash, securities, or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company’s market cap. The types of companies they look at are usually: \\- Cash-burning \\- Strategically dead or stuck in R&D limbo \\- Unloved by the market But still public, regulated, and liquid. Instead of trying to fix these businesses, the idea is much colder: Buy control or influence, shut down what doesn’t work, liquidate or distribute assets, and turn that “trapped” public-market capital into cash. So far, that part at least makes sense to me. Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next. They don’t just liquidate, return cash, and move on. The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that: \\- Recycles that capital repeatedly \\- Tries to use equity more than debt \\- Focuses on growing NAV per share, not revenue or EPS optics \\- Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin (which I know is controversial) The internal framing is basically: “We’re arbitraging public-market mispricing, not running operating companies.” No hero CEOs. No turnaround fantasies. No “this biotech pipeline will work eventually.” Just: buy assets cheaper than they’re worth, realize value, redeploy, repeat. Apparently, there’s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing, liquidations happening, and capital being returned. What’s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale, especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure. On one hand, the logic feels clean. It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn’t rely on market optimism just arithmetic. On the other hand, public markets are messy: Boards resist. Shareholder votes take time. Regulators interfere. Discounts don’t always close. Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside. Once you start recycling instead of returning capital, timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more. So I’m not posting this to promote anything. I’m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks. For people who’ve seen similar strategies up close: Does public-market NAV arbitrage actually scale as a long-term strategy? Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks? Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time, politics, and dead capital? I’d really appreciate blunt feedback. If this is naive, I’d prefer to learn that now.",

I ’ m trying to figure out whether this is something interesting or just a clever idea that doesn ’ t hold up in the real world . This firm isn ’ t focused on the usual private equity venture capital or hedge fund activities . They ’ re not_betting on growth stories turnarounds or “ great management teams. ” Their entire thesis is built on one uncomfortable idea Public markets have many companies trading for less than what they already own . Not_ “ undervalued future potential. ” Not_ “ great product bad quarter. ” It ’ s literally cash securities or other liquid assets on the balance sheet that exceed the company ’ s market cap . The types of companies they look at are usually Cashburning Strategically dead or stuck in RD limbo Unloved by the market But still public regulated and liquid . Instead of trying to fix these businesses the idea is much colder Buy control or influence shut down what doesn ’ t work liquidate or distribute assets and turn that “ trapped ” publicmarket capital into cash . So far that part at least makes sense to me . Where I start to feel conflicted is what comes next . They don ’ t just liquidate return cash and move on . The idea is to pool the realized capital into a permanent public vehicle that Recycles that capital repeatedly Tries to use equity more than debt Focuses on growing NAV per share not_revenue or EPS optics Allocates part of the treasury into Bitcoin which I know is controversial The internal framing is basically “ We ’ re arbitraging publicmarket mispricing not_running operating companies. ” No_hero CEOs . No_turnaround fantasies . No_ “ this biotech pipeline will work eventually. ” Just buy assets cheaper than they ’ re worth realize value redeploy repeat . Apparently there ’ s historical precedent for this working in individual cases discounts to NAV closing liquidations happening and capital being returned . What ’ s less clear to me is whether this works systematically and at scale especially when you try to keep recycling capital within one structure . On one hand the logic feels clean . It avoids a lot of operational execution risk and doesn ’ t rely on market optimism just arithmetic . On the other hand public markets are messy Boards resist . Shareholder votes take time . Regulators interfere . Discounts don ’ t always close . Cash burn and dilution can quietly eat the upside . Once you start recycling instead of returning capital timing and incentives suddenly matter a lot more . So I ’ m not_posting this to promote anything . I ’ m genuinely trying to build judgment early and would appreciate reality checks . For people who ’ ve seen similar strategies up close Does publicmarket NAV arbitrage actually scale as a longterm strategy Is capital recycling inside a permanent structure where this usually breaks Or is this one of those ideas that looks elegant on paper but gets crushed by time politics and dead capital I ’ d really appreciate blunt feedback . If this is naive I ’ d prefer to learn that now ."

Reasonable valuation with room for synergies: procurement scale benefits, overhead reduction, expanding Purells retail presence. What do you guys think of the deal? Net Positive or Net Negative for the stock at \\~$113? I personally think it’s a strong net positive for brand durability. Clorox’s portfolio is now filled with earned monopolies ( business having #1 or #2 market share position in stable categories)",

Interest rates are secondary compared to transparency, reporting quality and how platforms behave during stress. Defaults and delays don’t necessarily mean losses, but they test patience. Buyback mechanisms help psychologically, but they are not guarantees in the banking sense. The biggest value for me wasn’t yield, but understanding how credit cycles work outside public markets. That alone improved how I assess risk elsewhere.",

      "selftext": "You might ask yourselves, with all the selling happening in the markets, why does Gold continue to go up? It seems like right now, Gold and other precious metals are acting as safe haven investments amidst the economic chaos, On top of that, the narrative of countries buying Gold as reserves instead of dollars is putting extra pressure on the dollar. At some point, a weakening dollar tends to push people into risk assets, If wealthy investors continue buying Gold heavily, it could signal a shift in sentiment, Could this pattern spill over into crypto pumping too, taking profits, and pumping again? Gold already gained over 50% in 2025, and 2026 hasn’t slowed it down, Could the current environment actually be setting up a favorable stage for crypto to rally next? What do you all think, are we about to see a similar safe-to-risk rotation into crypto?",

      "selftext": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit. This past week, we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro, Swiss franc, and British pound. Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven, in part, by another factor. That is, on Friday, the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check. Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S. It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards, which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar. I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York. For those of you who do not dabble in currencies, rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies. Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth. Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finance's unprecedented rate increases this year, the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies. Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen. Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting. He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar. Due to these factors, we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not respond promptly, then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yen-dollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen. If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts, then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen. Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one. Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies. Rate increases would likely have the longest-lasting impact on depressing the dollar. Yen-denominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollar-based treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns. This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen. Alternatively, a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar. This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later, though. This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and pre-market hours on Monday. My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar, which is commodities. In particular, I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar, caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies, will act as a short-term and medium-term backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold. If anything, it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners. That, in turn, could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities. My plan is to continue to hold approximately $6.61M in UGL (90000 shares) and $2.08M in GDXU (4500 shares) for a bit longer than I had planned. I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch. I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill. I most recently re-entered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago. I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their non-leveraged versions and various, non-leveraged equities once I hit certain targets. Also, since I will likely get asked about this, I prefer to hold leveraged ETF/ETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative. Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during pre-market hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming. This has been useful several times. In December, I was able to dodge a 10% overall decline in UGL and a 25% decline on GDXU, which was spurred by CME's margin capital increase, by selling right at pre-market open. My draw down was only in the 2-4% range for both positions. Similarly, in October, I was able to walk away with only a 3-6% decline in both positions versus an approximately 10-15% total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open.",

      "selftext_processed": "I had wanted to post this play on Friday evening but preparations for the looming snowstorms delayed things a bit . This past week we witnessed a precipitous decline in the U.S. dollar against a basket of currencies like the euro Swiss franc and British pound . Movement that might normally be attributed to recent geopolitical concerns was driven in part by another factor . That is on Friday the Bank of Japan reached out to the U.S. Treasury Department to ask the U.S. Federal Reserve for a rate check . Murmurs about this rate check trickled out from various currency dealers just before lunchtime on the East Coast in the U.S . It was a widely known secret about an hour afterwards which led to further downward pressure on the yen that also carried over to the U.S. dollar . I believe that most of the dealers were authorized to publicly comment on the request after the closing bell in New York . For those of you who do not_dabble in currencies rate checks are one way for central banks to strengthen their own currencies . Doing so avoids the hassle of directly raising rates and the negative effects those rate changes can have on domestic growth . Despite the Japanese Ministry of Finances unprecedented rate increases this year the yen has been somewhat sluggish to gain favor against other currencies . Japan has fiscal and political concerns that are depressing the yen . Both the Korean won and Taiwanese dollar are similarly weak . U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent commented on this currency weakness about a few days ago and presumably again at sidebars at the World Economic Forum meeting . He has probably already started coordinating a strengthening of those currencies against the dollar . Due to these factors we will see one of two outcomes that play out very soon . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance does not_respond promptly then there will likely be a short squeeze of the yendollar currency pair and a further debasement of the yen . If the Japanese Ministry of Finance acts then it will do so by either raising rates further or offloading U.S. dollars for yen . Swapping currencies was the preferred approach by the two previous Japanese administrations and may be adopted by the current one . Either of these outcomes will undoubtedly lead to further declines of the dollar relative to the yen and other currencies . Rate increases would likely have the longestlasting impact on depressing the dollar . Yendenominated bonds would start to look even more attractive compared to dollarbased treasuries while coming with significantly fewer political concerns . This could lead to an outflow of dollars in favor of the yen . Alternatively a sharp yen rally absent a rate hike would likely cause another violent drop of the U.S. dollar . This would be coupled with the potential for a slow dollar recovery rally against the yen a few weeks later though . This knowledge leads to a few YOLO plays especially if no_actions are taken by Japan during overnight hours on Sunday and premarket hours on Monday . My preferred play is to continue to trade a market with which I am familiar which is commodities . In particular I am banking on the fact that a continuously declining dollar caused in the short term by the forced strengthening of certain Asian currencies will act as a shortterm and mediumterm backstop against any large pullbacks in precious metals like gold . If anything it may allow for continued upwards movement in spot gold prices going into earnings season for gold and silver miners . That in turn could raise forward guidance for miners and lead to a few surprise gains for the biggest entities . My plan is to continue to hold approximately $ 6.61M in UGL 90000 shares and $ 2.08M in GDXU 4500 shares for a bit longer than I had planned . I have entered into and exited from these positions a few times over an extended period and typically held them for about two to three months each stretch . I was able to ride the rallies from near their beginnings and skip the dips at the expense of a huge tax bill . I most recently reentered into these positions at the beginning of the new year and accelerated purchasing two weeks ago . I will be paring those positions and rotating most of the principal back into their nonleveraged versions and various nonleveraged equities once I hit certain targets . Also since I will likely get asked about this I prefer to hold leveraged ETFETN shares versus LEAPS contracts for large positions like these that are highly speculative . Holding shares allows me to buy and sell during premarket hours and thus start trimming to lock in gains when there is a wave of negative sentiment forming . This has been useful several times . In December I was able to dodge a 10 % overall decline in UGL and a 25 % decline on GDXU which was spurred by CMEs margin capital increase by selling right at premarket open . My draw down was only in the 24 % range for both positions . Similarly in October I was able to walk away with only a 36 % decline in both positions versus an approximately 1015 % total decrease had I been forced to wait until market open ."

( for e.g. when nvidia h100 was coming out, I saw SK Hynix to be the prime beneficiary, but I couldn't buy as it was/is only listed in Taiwan). Similar misses with Toshiba elec. and many others. I have tried US ADR but these are very limited and don't cover a lot of promising stocks. After so many misses, want to find a good platform that allows me to trade these markets. and also handles the taxes part well. Any good platform suggestion ? I currently own Charles Schwab ToS and some other accounts",

They sell more than about 15 billion per year. Impinj might sell a tag IC for $0.005-$0.02. Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others. Inlay manufacturers sell inlays (tag IC + antenna + substrate) to end customers to attach to their products. Tags can be little stickers, adhered to paper clothing tags, sewed nearly invisibly into clothing, hidden inside anything non-metallic or non-liquid, etc. Impinj also manufactures expensive stand-alone RFID readers, but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers. I don't have much to say about their readers. Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICs/chips. Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly. Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10-year agreement to not sue over patents, which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034. David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches. For the next 8 years, Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP. RAIN RFID is currently used in places like: Walmart, Inditex (clothing), UPS (package tracking, package-on-right-truck verification), Delta and United (baggage tracking), medicine tracking, car tires and other parts, etc. Supply chains and clothing, primarily. Recent investor calls show they're starting to push food with Kroger. Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets, which may explain their current valuation, which is arguably high. They're starting in the bakery sections now. Engineering deets you can skip if you're not technical: Tag ICs have been improving in performance, usually about 1-2dB (RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity) per generation / node shrink. This has been essential to the technology's capability and expanded usage. I asked Gemini about next node and it's guessing 20-something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound, which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not get smaller. Impinj knows this. Digital performance/capability/featureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes. Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology. Also, smaller node = more tag ICs per wafer = cheaper tag ICs, so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead. 20-something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not have a premium. Impinj requires cheap wafers. Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls (do your own reading on this). I know Trump is fucking over US-EU relations and is causing EU re-evaluation of large initiatives and regulations, so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all, even as a option/backup. HOWEVER, Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame: retail consumers. Right now, RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout. The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously, but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase. Consumer use is the reason for Impinj's new \"Protected Mode\". Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN. Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone, or Kroger could set PIN(s) for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries' tags at home for pantry inventory, etc. You get the idea. There's also insights into Impinj's thoughts from press releases on Gen2x, which extends the protocol the tag ICs use: \"It \\[Gen2x\\] addresses consumer privacy at point-of-sale.. \\[...\\] We are today focused on enterprise use cases, but tomorrow’s emphasis will be on consumer use cases, including consumer safety and item sustainability.\" \"Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting, fraudulent returns, or both.\" \"Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers. When necessary, the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN.\" \"Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product’s authenticity using a challenge-response protocol, preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain.\" I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic. Impinj must control that. I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself ('this is a Nike Air shoe, number 123456' for example) but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication ('Impinj indeed made this tag IC, it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database'). So Impinj won't know what the product is (only the brands will, like Walmart or Nike), but Impinj uniquely will be involved in \\*every tag scan for authentication\\*. Impinj will not make ad revenue on item data itself - only end-users like Nike or Kroger would. However, Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchases/returns. Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service. Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones. Qualcomm Q-6690 - UHF (RAIN) RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time. Commercial/industrial device focus only. It's a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHF/RAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC. That will unlock tons more potential. Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature. I see this playing out like so: 1. Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger (or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever) 2. For the first time, companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there. 3. Companies know what food is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 4. Companies know what clothing is in someone's house and how long it's been there. 5. Fundamentally, Companies know identifying information of any UHF (RAIN) RFID tagged item in anyone's house (if the tag IC is alive and enabled), as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from. 6. Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information. Impinj won't make money off this directly, but this'll push more tags to be in more things. 7. Companies will want to tag fucking everything, so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion. I'd say >20x growth potential, reasonably, not including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me. Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth (which everyone already has) but I don't see it. Inlays are 2-5x as expensive, read rate is 100x to >1000x slower, tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a reader/interrogator, tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere. I'd forget about it. I think Impinj needs to hit +20% yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and today's valuation. Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $200+/share. Consumer market is the moonshot / gamble for long term holders. Authentication, to me, is a positive thing of unknown magnitude/effect, though it'd definitely improve margins. Risks: \\-Trump's continued antagonizing of Europe (and the world) may harm/kill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize and/or may create preference for NXP within the EU. Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID. \\-Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to S&P smallcap 600. Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retail/holiday cycle. Many sudden ups/downs based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the company's growth as a result. Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in. \\-The timeline to break into the consumer space, if it ever does, may still be long. Obstacles: \\-Tagging metal surfaces (like canned goods or foil-lined bags) can be done and the physics has been solved, but crucially it remains expensive at >$0.60 per tag. A normal RAIN RFID tag (tag IC + inlay) might be $0.035-$0.05. A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news. Until then, this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology. \\-Breaking into consumer (normal person) smartphones for the high growth trajectory. Impinj is making all the right moves so far, but it's a barrier that hasn't been broken yet. Bulls: \\-If you hear about major new enterprise customers, that's bullish. Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon. \\-If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service, that's bullish. \\-If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough, that's very bullish. \\-If the EU \\*mandates\\* RAIN RFID for DPP, that's very bullish (whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option, that's somewhat bullish). \\-If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF (RAIN) RFID capability built into consumer phones, that's extremely bullish. Bears: \\-If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts, that's bearish. \\-If Impinj's only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share (like vs NXP) rather than new market growth, that's very bearish. Recommendation: Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below \\~$110. Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $70 (like last April) because I'd peg Impinj at roughly $50-$60 without its growth premium at all. Sit on it for 3 years and then re-evaluate.",

      "selftext_processed": "My position details I own 1982 shares of Impinj PI stock . PI market cap $ 4.8B Impinj manufactures UHF RAIN RFID tag integrated circuits ICs . They sell more than about 15 billion per year . Impinj might sell a tag IC for $ 0.005 $ 0.02 . Impinj sells the tag ICs to inlay manufacturers like Avery Denison and others . Inlay manufacturers sell inlays tag IC antenna substrate to end customers to attach to their products . Tags can be little stickers adhered to paper clothing tags sewed nearly invisibly into clothing hidden inside anything nonmetallic or nonliquid etc . Impinj also manufactures expensive standalone RFID readers but also sells the reader IC used by several other companies who then sell their cheaper readers to end customers . I dont have much to say about their readers . Impinj competes with NXP in tag ICschips . Impinj won lawsuit against NXP in 2024 and receives license fee yearly . Part of settlement beyond the yearly cash is a 10year agreement to not_sue over patents which is a huge relief for Impinj through 2034 . David defeated Goliath once and Impinj has 8 more years before any possible rematches . For the next 8 years Impinj has freedom to grow aggressively without fear of immediate retaliatory litigation from NXP . RAIN RFID is currently used in places like Walmart Inditex clothing UPS package tracking packageonrighttruck verification Delta and United baggage tracking medicine tracking car tires and other parts etc . Supply chains and clothing primarily . Recent investor calls show theyre starting to push food with Kroger . Food opportunity for Impinj and tagging is obviously very large compared to their current markets which may explain their current valuation which is arguably high . Theyre starting in the bakery sections now . Engineering deets you can skip if youre not_technical Tag ICs have been improving in performance usually about 12dB RF link budget spec for tag sensitivity per generation node shrink . This has been essential to the technologys capability and expanded usage . I asked Gemini about next node and its guessing 20something nm will be the final node and its reasons are sound which means tag chip analog performance improvement is nearing its end and the analog circuitry will not_get smaller . Impinj knows this . Digital performancecapabilityfeatureset may yet still improve with even smaller nodes . Impinj has been focusing on broadening featureset like cryptography and gen2x and is clearly leading and driving its technology . Also smaller node more tag ICs per wafer cheaper tag ICs so Impinj still certainly has one more significant margin increase ahead . 20something nm nodes are well matured at this point and should not_have a premium . Impinj requires cheap wafers . Impinj likes to talk about the European DPP initiative in their investor calls do your own reading on this . I know Trump is fucking over USEU relations and is causing EU reevaluation of large initiatives and regulations so I have my doubts about DPP ever using RAIN RFID at all even as a optionbackup . HOWEVER Impinj clearly sees it as a backdoor into the real endgame retail consumers . Right now RAIN RFID tags are always killed at checkout . The EU DPP would expand RAIN RFID adoption obviously but more importantly would necessarily keep tags alive after item purchase . Consumer use is the reason for Impinjs new Protected Mode . Tags with Protected mode look dead and only wake up if given the right PIN . Retailer controls PIN and can transfer PIN to consumer via smartphone or Kroger could set PINs for all its products and allow consumers to query their groceries tags at home for pantry inventory etc . You get the idea . Theres also insights into Impinjs thoughts from press releases on Gen2x which extends the protocol the tag ICs use It Gen2x addresses consumer privacy at pointofsale .. ... We are today focused on enterprise use cases but tomorrow ’ s emphasis will be on consumer use cases including consumer safety and item sustainability . Inhibits tag and item counterfeiting fraudulent returns or both . Impinj Protected Mode tag data protection Makes a RAIN tag invisible to RAIN readers . When necessary the tag can be returned to normal operation using a secure PIN . Impinj Authenticity cryptographic authentication Verifies a product ’ s authenticity using a challengeresponse protocol preventing counterfeits and securing the supply chain . I suspect that authentication requires a centralized database to verify that the tag chip itself is authentic . Impinj must control that . I doubt that Impinj will control the item info itself this is a Nike Air shoe number 123456 for example but will control authentication and will certainly charge a fee per scan for authentication Impinj indeed made this tag IC it matches code xyzpdq in our authentication database . So Impinj wont know what the product is only the brands will like Walmart or Nike but Impinj uniquely will be involved in every tag scan for authentication . Impinj will not_make ad revenue on item data itself only endusers like Nike or Kroger would . However Impinj will certainly charge for authentication events like store purchasesreturns . Imagine getting an additional few cents return per tag IC via the authentication service . Impinj is clearly trying to get into consumer phones . Qualcomm Q6690 UHF RAIN RFID integrated into mobile processor for the first time . Commercialindustrial device focus only . Its a relatively easy jump to consumer smartphones from here now that a UHFRAIN RFID radio has been integrated into an IC . That will unlock tons more potential . Smartphone manufactueres may be excited about finally introducing a significant new feature . I see this playing out like so 1 . Consumer enables RFID reading on their household grocery items via Kroger or their clothing items via Kohls or whoever 2 . For the first time companies get information on where items go once they leave the stores and how long they stay there . 3 . Companies know what food is in someones house and how long its been there . 4 . Companies know what clothing is in someones house and how long its been there . 5 . Fundamentally Companies know identifying information of any UHF RAIN RFID tagged item in anyones house if the tag IC is alive and enabled as long as consumers have a phone that can read them AND as long as consumers allow the tags to be read again with the PIN from the store they bought their stuff from . 6 . Advertiser potential galore for whoever has this information . Impinj wont make money off this directly but thisll push more tags to be in more things . 7 . Companies will want to tag fucking everything so Impinj sells 100s of billions of tags per year instead of 15 billion . Id say 20x growth potential reasonably not_including the value of authentication services which is fuzzy to me . Wiliot has been brought up as an existential threat to RAIN RFID because it uses Bluetooth which everyone already has but I dont see it . Inlays are 25x as expensive read rate is 100x to 1000x slower tag beacons its info out randomly instead of upon query by a readerinterrogator tag beaconing interval depends on ambient energy levels which vary everywhere . Id forget about it . I think Impinj needs to hit 20 % yearly growth by gaining enterprise customers to meet investor expectations and todays valuation . Hitting those high targets will reward Impinj with consistent $ 200share . Consumer market is the moonshot gamble for long term holders . Authentication to me is a positive thing of unknown magnitudeeffect though itd definitely improve margins . Risks Trumps continued antagonizing of Europe and the world may harmkill RAIN RFID consumer adoption via DPP as EU countries reprioritize andor may create preference for NXP within the EU . Reducing global cooperation is bad for global standards for RAIN RFID . Stock is unusually volatile despite being recently added to SP smallcap 600 . Seems to have a strong yearly cycle based on retailholiday cycle . Many sudden upsdowns based on enterprise performance and news and whether investors believe in the companys growth as a result . Be patient and only buy in low if you buy in . The timeline to break into the consumer space if it ever does may still be long . Obstacles Tagging metal surfaces like canned goods or foillined bags can be done and the physics has been solved but crucially it remains expensive at $ 0.60 per tag . A normal RAIN RFID tag tag IC inlay might be $ 0.035 $ 0.05 . A cost breakthrough for metal surfaces would be big news . Until then this fundamentally limits RAIN RFID in grocery and remains a barrier for the technology . Breaking into consumer normal person smartphones for the high growth trajectory . Impinj is making all the right moves so far but its a barrier that hasnt been broken yet . Bulls If you hear about major new enterprise customers thats bullish . Imipnj can dream about getting Amazon . If you hear about the launch of an Impinj authentication service thats bullish . If you hear that RAIN RFID tags for metal surfaces have a cost breakthrough thats very bullish . If the EU mandates RAIN RFID for DPP thats very bullish whereas if RAIN RFID is just an option thats somewhat bullish . If any major smartphone manufacturer announces UHF RAIN RFID capability built into consumer phones thats extremely bullish . Bears If Impinj fails to secure new large enterprise accounts thats bearish . If Impinjs only growth over the next two years is through increasing its market share like vs NXP rather than new market growth thats very bearish . Recommendation Diversify your portfolio with Impinj if it dips below $ 110 . Buy a large amount if it ever dips below $ 70 like last April because Id peg Impinj at roughly $ 50 $ 60 without its growth premium at all . Sit on it for 3 years and then reevaluate ."

So Tesla regardless of being valued at 50-60 billion dollars back until 2018 wasn't part of SP500 since it hadn't posted 4 quarters of profits. Ocassional quarter profits, but no consequetive profits. That changed in 2019, when the company posted 4 consequetive years worth of profit. After successful profit years, even if minimal, Money Managers at Wall Street took a note and started aggressively buying to push the stock up. So much so, that even before the inclusion of stock in index, it was at 400 billion dollars worth of market cap. And passive indexes were forced to buy in the stock at rebalancing. Hence locking the value. I don't have data to back the initial rally between end of 4th quarter profit and date of sp500 inclusion. And this where I'm guessing. Perhaps y'all could correct me or show some data if that's actually true.",

I ’ ll love to know what you guys think please prove me wrong or bring up anything I ’ m missing thanks . My POTENTIAL trade for reference is a long put 33 a contract exp 6 of Feb strike at 1320 . Break even is roughly 1287 ."

For some reason, purely on feeling, I wanted to buy out-of-the-money SPY calls and put my entire non-registered account into that trade. The contracts were trading at $0.05 each. I was honestly confident. But I didn’t pull the trigger because I didn’t want to sell my S&P 500 shares and deal with taxes. So I stayed disciplined and did nothing. Two hours later, Trump announces he found an arrangement with Greenland. SPY pumps 1.2% almost instantly. Those same calls go from $0.05 to $2.65. That’s a 53x move. About a 5,200% gain. If I had gone all in like my instinct told me, it would’ve been life-changing money. Instead, I watched it happen from the sidelines. Now every day when I go to work, I think about it. I replay it in my head. “What if I just clicked buy.” It’s brutal. I know logically this is just part of trading and you can’t catch everything, but emotionally it feels different when it’s that big. How do you actually move on from missing something like this? How do you stop letting a single trade live rent-free in your head? Would really appreciate advice from people who’ve been through similar situations.",

I was honestly confident . But I didn ’ t pull the trigger because I didn ’ t want to sell my SP 500 shares and deal with taxes . So I stayed disciplined and did nothing_Two hours later Trump announces he found an arrangement with Greenland . SPY pumps 1.2 % almost instantly . Those same calls go from $ 0.05 to $ 2.65 . That ’ s a 53x move . About a 5200 % gain . If I had gone all in like my instinct told me it would ’ ve been lifechanging money . Instead I watched it happen from the sidelines . Now every day when I go to work I think about it . I replay it in my head . “ What if I just clicked buy. ” It ’ s brutal . I know logically this is just part of trading and you can ’ t catch everything but emotionally it feels different when it ’ s that big . How do you actually move on from missing something like this How do you stop letting a single trade live rentfree in your head Would really appreciate advice from people who ’ ve been through similar situations ."

(NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

I still believe AMC could have some ideas they can pull out their sleeves but it doesn’t seem like they’ve tried to lean into any new approaches to stay relevant in a streaming world. They’ve gotta have a game plan ready and I can totally see it riding in the $teens for sure. Am I just delusional?",

      "selftext": "Hello there, I’m sure many are aware of a memory super-cycle taking place. What I’m not seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet. I know there has been a lot of fear, and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks. However, most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028. I’m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side. The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4. Sandisk, Western Digital, and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory. They are worth taking the time for DD. However, I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far. Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE. You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand, crucial. They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY, they have two in their home state of Idaho, One in Virginia. They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan. Basically, they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI. The thing is, all of this won’t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest. So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble. I’ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback, we’ve already opened Pandora’s box. If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics & believers. Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it’s not going anywhere. People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI, but guess what? Your aunties and cousins all love AI. No matter what they slop is they still consume. That’s just on the reels side of things. When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races. The reason I’m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027. This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030’s. For the consumers sake, I hope not. But it’s a realistic scenario we face. Back to Micron. There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price. The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation. “Although it just hit new all time highs of $399, Micron trades at a forward P/E of roughly 10–12. This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA (24x) or AMD (35x). This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028. That would make today’s mark look like a steep discount. I see them having steady growth through the entire year. As for price action, they’ve been steady as well. Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery. Just want you all to be aware, I’m holding about 140 MU & 130 WDC. So I’m very bullish on memory. However for MU I didn’t enter until the 330 range. Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month. So if an insider is that bullish, I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them. What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle?",

I know there has been a lot of fear, and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks. However, most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028. I’m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side.

People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI, but guess what? Your aunties and cousins all love AI. No matter what they slop is they still consume. That’s just on the reels side of things. When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races. The reason I’m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027. This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030’s. For the consumers sake, I hope not. But it’s a realistic scenario we face. Back to Micron. There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year. There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price. The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation. “Although it just hit new all time highs of $399, Micron trades at a forward P/E of roughly 10–12.

This momentum is expected to accelerate, with analysts projecting full-year fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $75.6 billion, a 102% increase over 2025.” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028.

Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery. Just want you all to be aware, I’m holding about 140 MU & 130 WDC. So I’m very bullish on memory.

      "selftext_processed": "Hello there I ’ m sure many are aware of a memory supercycle taking place . What I ’ m not_seeing is a lot of retail sentiment toward these tickers yet . I know there has been a lot of fear and I know there has been a lot of concern of the cyclical nature of memory stocks . However most experts are expecting the memory shortage to last until at least 2028 . I ’ m going to focus on High Bandwidth Memory HBM since storage has gotten a lot of love on the retail side . The three largest HBM manufacturers around the world Micron Samsung and SK Hynix have all sold out of their 2026 supply for HBM4 . Sandisk Western Digital and Seagate are all worth mentioning since they are part of storage memory . They are worth taking the time for DD . However I feel they have gotten more retail love than HBM so far . Micron is the only manufacturer in the big three for HBM on the NYSE . You may recognize their consumer RAM they just slashed to shift toward demand crucial . They are currently developing four fabrication labs in NY they have two in their home state of Idaho One in Virginia . They recently acquired a PSMC in Taiwan . Basically they are leveraging their growth for a boost in demand in regard to AI . The thing is all of this won ’ t start to make a dent in demand until the end of 2027 At the earliest . So far we have been living in a world that questions if AI is a bubble . I ’ ve come to the conclusion for myself that even if AI does have a pullback we ’ ve already opened Pandora ’ s box . If our markets have been only led by a group by AI skeptics believers . Wait until the bubble fears subside and everyone else realizes it ’ s not_going anywhere . People thought the dead internet theory would hurt AI but guess what Your aunties and cousins all love AI . No_matter what they slop is they still consume . That ’ s just on the reels side of things . When agenetic AI and other technologies like Boston Dyanmics improve it will be off to the races . The reason I ’ m explaining all of this is to explain the HBM shortage bear case is only until 2027 . This shortage could potentially lead into the 2030 ’ s . For the consumers sake I hope not_But it ’ s a realistic scenario we face . Back to Micron . There is bullish cause to believe they may reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of the year . There was sentiment of years prior that they were held price in price . The spring they experienced last year may just have been escaping manipulation . “ Although it just hit new all time highs of $ 399 Micron trades at a forward PE of roughly 10–12 . This is a significant discount compared to AI leaders like NVIDIA 24x or AMD 35x . This momentum is expected to accelerate with analysts projecting fullyear fiscal 2026 revenue to potentially reach $ 75.6 billion a 102 % increase over 2025. ” To me if we get tailwind that this shortage is lasting past 2028 . That would make today ’ s mark look like a steep discount . I see them having steady growth through the entire year . As for price action they ’ ve been steady as well . Pretty normal pullback right after all time highs but quick recovery . Just want you all to be aware I ’ m holding about 140 MU 130 WDC . So I ’ m very bullish on memory . However for MU I didn ’ t enter until the 330 range . Which a Micron insider also did with 7.8 million dollars just this month . So if an insider is that bullish I would also say that keeps me polishing my diamond hands in the meantime while I get tendy grease all over them . What are your alls thoughts on the super cycle"

      "selftext": "I’m looking for feedback on my overall financial and investment strategy, particularly around asset allocation and how I’m using my Solo 401(k). I’m 35, married, and expect to earn approximately **$492,000 pre-tax this year as a 1099 physician**. My long-term goal is early retirement around age 55, so I’m trying to balance growth, diversification, and tax efficiency while managing income volatility. My currently does not work and is in school full time, but will be looking for work in the coming months after graduation in May. **Accounts & current positioning:** **Roth IRA** **(backdoor):** * \\~$8,400 total * 50/50 split between **VTI / VXUS** * Haven’t made my 2026 contribution yet * Intended for long-term, tax-free growth **Solo 401(k) (traditional):** * \\~$16,000 invested, split **90/10 between VXUS / FTEC** * \\~$22,000 currently in cash * This account is where I’m considering a higher growth tilt **Cash / short-term holdings:** * \\~$76,000 in a HYSA earning \\~3.30% * \\~$459,000 in a CD earning \\~3.92%, maturing in the next few months and earmarked for a home down payment **Debt** * \\~$400,000 in student loans Because the CD funds are intended for a near-term home purchase, I’m treating them as non-investable capital and avoiding market risk with that money. **What I’m looking for feedback on:** * Whether my overall risk level and allocation make sense given my age, income, and early retirement timeline * Should my spouse open up a spousal Roth IRA, and would they need to do it via backdoor? * How aggressive it’s reasonable to be inside the Solo 401(k) relative to the Roth IRA * How others would think about deploying the remaining **$22K of cash in the Solo 401(k)** from an asset-allocation perspective (not specific recommendations, but frameworks) * Whether my current international and growth exposure is balanced or redundant * Any tax inefficiencies or structural blind spots I may be overlooking as a high-income 1099 earner **Notes:** * Really don't want to try to pay down student loans, but that might be a bad move * A house purchase is a must for us in the few months, so using the money in the CD to pay off student loans is a no-go * 1099s have a hard time getting approved for home loans I’m not looking for personalized financial advice, just general insights, critiques, or alternative ways to think about structuring this setup.",

      "selftext": "The Trump administration is planning to inject $1.6bn into an American rare earths company, its biggest investment in the sector, in Washington’s latest foray into private industry to shore up supplies of key minerals. The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth, a publicly traded Oklahoma-based miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths, according to people familiar with the matter. The government investment and a separate $1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday, according to people familiar with the situation. One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m, both at a price of $17.17. The government agreed to pay $277mn for the equity, giving it an implied gain of $490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $24.77. USA Rare Earth will also receive $1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government. The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022. A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company. Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “framework” for a deal that could include access to Greenland’s untapped critical mineral wealth. One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland. USA Rare Earth declined to comment. The commerce department declined to discuss the deal. But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security”. USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald, the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons, to raise more than $1bn in fresh equity financing, the people said. It is not directly related to the deal with the government. The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration’s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security, including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a so-called golden-share agreement in US Steel. USA Rare Earth, which has a market value of $3.7bn, is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca, Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones, missiles and fighter jets. It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Last year, the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies, including MP Materials, Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas. Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration. The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements, a rare earths start-up three months after the president’s son Donald Trump Jr’s venture capital group invested in the company. The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production. A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $500mn from investors. It is on track to raise more than $1bn because of high demand for the financing deal, which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity, often called a “Pipe”. Cantor’s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick, one of Trump’s most prominent cabinet members, has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president’s “America first” agenda. Cantor did not play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth. Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year, helped by a 40 per cent jump this week. The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Trump administration is planning to inject $ 1.6bn into an American rare earths company its biggest investment in the sector in Washington ’ s latest foray into private industry to shore up supplies of key minerals . The US government will receive a 10 per cent stake in USA Rare Earth a publicly traded Oklahomabased miner that controls significant US deposits of heavy rare earths according to people familiar with the matter . The government investment and a separate $ 1bn private financing deal are expected to be announced on Monday according to people familiar with the situation . One person said the government would get 16.1m shares in USA Rare Earth and warrants for another 17.6m both at a price of $ 17.17 . The government agreed to pay $ 277mn for the equity giving it an implied gain of $ 490mn for the equity and warrants based on the current share price of $ 24.77 . USA Rare Earth will also receive $ 1.3bn in senior secured debt financing at market rates from the government . The money will come from a finance facility created for the commerce department as part of the CHIPS and Science Act passed in 2022 . A commerce official said the department completed the transaction directly with the company . Talks progressed rapidly this week as investor interest returned to critical mineral stocks after President Donald Trump said Washington had reached the “ framework ” for a deal that could include access to Greenland ’ s untapped critical mineral wealth . One person familiar with the situation noted that the USA Rare Earth deal was unrelated to Greenland . USA Rare Earth declined to comment . The commerce department declined to discuss the deal . But an official in the Chips office — a part of the commerce department housed at the National Institute of Standards and Technology that led the negotiations — said it was “ focused on onshoring critical and strategic mineral essential to the semiconductor supply chain and US national security ” . USA Rare Earth has separately tapped Cantor Fitzgerald the Wall Street firm previously owned by commerce secretary Howard Lutnick and now run by his sons to raise more than $ 1bn in fresh equity financing the people said . It is not_directly related to the deal with the government . The deal marks the latest example of the Trump administration ’ s efforts to intervene in parts of the private sector viewed as critical to US national security including taking a 10 per cent stake in chipmaker Intel and negotiating a socalled goldenshare agreement in US Steel . USA Rare Earth which has a market value of $ 3.7bn is developing a huge mine in Sierra Blanca Texas that it says contains 15 of the 17 rare earth elements underpinning production of cell phones missiles and fighter jets . It also plans to open a magnet production facility in Stillwater Oklahoma . Last year the Trump administration invested in at least six minerals companies including MP Materials Trilogy Metals and Lithium Americas . Some of the investments overlapped with the financial interests of people associated with the administration . The government did a funding deal with Vulcan Elements a rare earths startup three months after the president ’ s son Donald Trump Jr ’ s venture capital group invested in the company . The commerce department and defence department have worked closely together to financially boost domestic rare earth production . A condition of the government investment in USA Rare Earth was that the company raise at least an additional $ 500mn from investors . It is on track to raise more than $ 1bn because of high demand for the financing deal which uses a mechanism known as a private investment into a public equity often called a “ Pipe ” . Cantor ’ s involvement comes as the investment bank once led by Lutnick one of Trump ’ s most prominent cabinet members has expanded its investment banking capabilities to benefit from the president ’ s “ America first ” agenda . Cantor did not_play a role in advising on the US government investment in USA Rare Earth . Shares in USA Rare Earth have more than doubled this year helped by a 40 per cent jump this week . The company also sought advice from Cantor when it went public via a blank cheque vehicle in March last year ."

      "selftext": "**Full Disclosure:** I am a landman and have worked with Permian Resources on a contract basis in the past. While this has allowed me to peek under the hood, nothing contained below is privileged information. I just like the stock, the rock, and the management. Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware E&P pack through superior execution and a shareholder-friendly capital return framework. With the Q3’25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance, PR offers a compelling mix of income (**\\~4.8% yield**) and growth at a discount. Crucially, their recent reorganization (moving to a standard C-Corp) has made this the “grown-up” energy hold for my IRA, removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away. **1. The \"Why Now\": Corporate Clean-Up** On Jan 7, 2026, PR completed a major reorganization. Management and long-term holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares. * **The Signal:** Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders (\"eating their own cooking\"). * **The Catalyst:** This removes the \"governance discount.\" Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex Up-C structures. By simplifying, PR widens its buyer pool significantly. **2. Operations: The \"Ground Game\" Advantage** This is where my background matters. While the majors hunt \"elephants\" (massive corporate buyouts), PR is playing a lethal \"ground game.\" * **Q3 Stats:** They closed **\\~250 small transactions** ($180M) in a single quarter. * **Why it works:** They are picking up $100 bills on the sidewalk—singles and doubles that add inventory efficiently without paying the massive M&A premiums seen in headline deals. * **The Numbers:** Production is up to **\\~410 Mboe/d**, Leverage is a boringly safe **0.8x**, and FCF hit a record **\\~$469M**. **3. The 2026 Setup** * **Inventory:** Street consensus sees 2026 FCF potentially exceeding 2025 levels ($1B+ potential) as capital efficiency improves. * **Analyst Action:** Morgan Stanley recently adjusted their PT to $18. With the stock trading \\~ $14.78, that implies **\\~22% upside** just to the target. * **Cash Return:** You get paid to wait. The base dividend is $0.15/quarter (\\~4.1% yield on cost), plus a $1B buyback authorization sitting in the chamber. **4. Risks (The \"Landman\" Reality Check)** No well is a guarantee. Here is what I am watching: * **Waha Gas Pricing:** Delaware Basin gas differentials can be nasty. If takeaway capacity gets tight, realized pricing drops. * **Service Costs:** If 2026 drilling activity heats up, rig rates and frac crews get expensive, squeezing margins. * **Oil Beta:** Obviously, if WTI crashes to $50, the thesis pauses. **My Position** * **Long:** 1,200 shares @ $12.46 Cost Basis. * **Plan:** Accumulating on dips. * **Next Event:** Q4 Earnings & 2026 Guidance on **Feb 25, 2026**. None of this is financial advice and please do your own due diligence. That’s all for now. Will update after earnings. Good luck and keep it turning to the right!",

While this has allowed me to peek under the hood nothing_contained below is privileged information . I just like the stock the rock and the management . Permian Resources has differentiated itself from the Delaware EP pack through superior execution and a shareholderfriendly capital return framework . With the Q3 ’ 25 print confirming record free cash flow and raised production guidance PR offers a compelling mix of income 4.8 % yield and growth at a discount . Crucially their recent reorganization moving to a standard CCorp has made this the “ grownup ” energy hold for my IRA removing the complexity discount that kept big funds away . 1 . The Why Now Corporate CleanUp On Jan 7 2026 PR completed a major reorganization . Management and longterm holders exchanged their complicated Class C shares for standard Class A public shares . The Signal Management is now in the same boat as public shareholders eating their own cooking . The Catalyst This removes the governance discount . Many large institutional funds automatically skip companies with complex UpC structures . By simplifying PR widens its buyer pool significantly . 2 . Operations The Ground Game Advantage This is where my background matters . While the majors hunt elephants massive corporate buyouts PR is playing a lethal ground game . Q3 Stats They closed 250 small transactions $ 180M in a single quarter . Why it works They are picking up $ 100 bills on the sidewalk—singles and doubles that add inventory efficiently without paying the massive MA premiums seen in headline deals . The Numbers Production is up to 410 Mboed Leverage is a boringly safe 0.8x and FCF hit a record $ 469M . 3 .

      "title": "Google is about to replace Nvidia as the world's #1 value company",
      "selftext": "The path to #1 is shorter than anyone realizes. Nvidia is sitting at roughly $4.62 Trillion while Google is at $3.99 Trillion. The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $380.50. That is just a 15.8% move from the current price of roughly $328 based on the close numbers. Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot? It wasn't just a number, it was a psychological trigger. The moment they hit #1, every news outlet ran the headline, ETFs rebalanced, and retail chased the winner. Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up. Once **across $380.50, the \"Google is King\" headlines start**, and the momentum buying kicks in. **The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance** Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri. Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured. They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices, and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices. Google now owns the AI layer on **100% of the mobile distribution channel**. No other competitor exists at this scale. They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market. **They are cloud leaders** Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft. We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand. Q3 2025 Revenue: $15.15 billion (up **34% year-over-year**). Annualized Run Rate: The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $61 billion. Operating Income: A record $3.59 billion for the third quarter, representing a 23.7% operating margin, indicating rapidly increasing profitability. Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a **$155 billion backlog.** **They are entertainment leaders** Youtube surpassed Netflix (and all other streaming services) According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report, YouTube captured 13.4% of total TV time, Netflix at 8.8%. Also Netflix: 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when it;s over (like now with stranger things) while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like. **Google has it's own silicon** Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade, meaning they don't pay the \"Nvidia Tax\" that crushes other tech companies margins. Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers. Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon? If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear. They instantly become a potential top-tier AI chip supplier with massive margins, they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV. This is a multi-billion dollar catalyst that is currently not being priced. **Even the valuation show's google is STILL mispriced** Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidia's future while ignoring Google's present cash flow. Look at the P/E ratio comparison. Google 32.6x P/E. For Nvidia,45.8x P/E. **That makes Google roughly 29% cheaper on PE valuation basis.** If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia, its stock price would be roughly $460. to hit $400 target, al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly. **Wall Street is quietly loading up** Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $400 target. Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $400 target. Canaccord raised their target to $390. they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings. **The non digital assets** Pixel 10 sales were up 28% year-over-year in September, capturing **7% of the US premium market** and stealing share directly from Samsung. And Waymo driverless taxi is no longer a side project. They are doing **450,000 paid rides** per week. They are live in Phoenix, SF, LA, and expanding fast. **TLDR** Google is winning on search, youtube, ads, cloud, AI Chip, driverless cars, mobile phones and is about to become the world's most valuable company. **On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $380.50 and after the call continue to $400.** \\*I’m holding 10k USD worth of $375C for Feb 6. I am calling Google at $400. I know that most of you are holding GOOG, so good luck tp us all. Next earnings: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday, February 4, at 1:30pm Pacific Time (4:30pm Eastern Time).

      "selftext_processed": "The path to 1 is shorter than anyone realizes . Nvidia is sitting at roughly $ 4.62 Trillion while Google is at $ 3.99 Trillion . The magic number Google needs to hit to surpass Nvidia is $ 380.50 . That is just a 15.8 % move from the current price of roughly $ 328 based on the close numbers . Remember what happened when Nvidia first took the top spot It wasnt just a number it was a psychological trigger . The moment they hit 1 every news outlet ran the headline ETFs rebalanced and retail chased the winner . Right now is that same wave for Google that is building up . Once across $ 380.50 the Google is King headlines start and the momentum buying kicks in . The Apple capitulation leading to mobile dominance Apple announced Gemini is going to be the default native AI for Siri . Think about the distribution monopoly they just secured . They have Gemini native on 3 billion Android devices and now they have integration across 1.5 billion iOS devices . Google now owns the AI layer on 100 % of the mobile distribution channel . No_other competitor exists at this scale . They have effectively checkmated the entire edge consumer AI market . They are cloud leaders Google Cloud revenue is accelerating at a rate that is frankly terrifying for Amazon and Microsoft . We are talking about parabolic revenue expansion driven by AI infrastructure demand . Q3 2025 Revenue $ 15.15 billion up 34 % yearoveryear . Annualized Run Rate The business is running at an annual pace of roughly $ 61 billion . Operating Income A record $ 3.59 billion for the third quarter representing a 23.7 % operating margin indicating rapidly increasing profitability . Google Cloud ended Q3 2025 with a $ 155 billion backlog . They are entertainment leaders Youtube surpassed Netflix and all other streaming services According to the latest Nielsen Gauge report YouTube captured 13.4 % of total TV time Netflix at 8.8 % . Also Netflix 325M subscribers come for a specific show and siappear when its over like now with stranger things while YouTube which has 2 Billion users who keep coming back to long form and shorts from never_ending list of creators the algorithm know they would like . Google has its own silicon Google has been building its own TPUs for a decade meaning they dont pay the Nvidia Tax that crushes other tech companies margins . Google can later on sell these chips to other hyperscalers . Can you imagine Microsoft or Meta running on Google silicon If they confirm this new revenue stream the stock goes nuclear . They instantly become a potential toptier AI chip supplier with massive margins they even go for rent model like IREN or CRWV . This is a multibillion dollar catalyst that is currently not_being priced . Even the valuation shows google is STILL mispriced Right now the market is paying a massive premium for Nvidias future while ignoring Googles present cash flow . Look at the PE ratio comparison . Google 32.6x PE . For Nvidia45.8x PE . That makes Google roughly 29 % cheaper on PE valuation basis . If Google were simply valued at the same multiple as Nvidia its stock price would be roughly $ 460 . to hit $ 400 target al is needed is taht the valuation gap to narrow slightly . Wall Street is quietly loading up Raymond James just upgraded to a Strong Buy with a $ 400 target . Pivotal Research reaffirmed their Buy rating with a $ 400 target . Canaccord raised their target to $ 390 . they are all converging on the same number right before the earnings . The non digital assets Pixel 10 sales were up 28 % yearoveryear in September capturing 7 % of the US premium market and stealing share directly from Samsung . And Waymo driverless taxi is no_longer a side project . They are doing 450000 paid rides per week . They are live in Phoenix SF LA and expanding fast . TLDR Google is winning on search youtube ads cloud AI Chip driverless cars mobile phones and is about to become the worlds most valuable company . On Feb 4th earnings call it will surge to the crossover point at $ 380.50 and after the call continue to $ 400 . I ’ m holding 10k USD worth of $ 375C for Feb 6 . I am calling Google at $ 400 . I know that most of you are holding GOOG so good luck tp us all . Next earnings Alphabet Inc. NASDAQ GOOG GOOGL will hold its quarterly conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025 financial results on Wednesday February 4 at 130pm Pacific Time 430pm Eastern Time .

      "selftext": "If you had bought four shares of Nvidia at its 1999 IPO, it would have cost you about $48. After stock splits and one of the most extreme compounding runs in market history, those four original shares would today be worth just under $500,000. Now imagine applying that same compounding logic to SpaceX, even if it does not start small. Assume, conservatively, that any eventual public pricing begins around a $1.5 trillion valuation. That number sounds enormous until you shift the frame from cheap to foundational. The companies that generated generational wealth over the last 30 to 40 years were not just successful businesses. They became infrastructure. SpaceX is positioning itself in exactly that role, not merely as a rocket company, but as a transportation, launch, communications, and orbital logistics platform. If you care about truly building wealth, the kind you can give to your kids, the kind that pays for college and maybe even helps them buy their first home, I cannot think of a better company than SpaceX. It is still pre-IPO, but it is not hard to imagine a future where Musk works out some mechanism that allows ordinary people to buy in early. Maybe even young couples, with one simple condition, that they are actually building families. Population decline is a real problem, and it is something Musk talks about openly and often. This part is admittedly wishful thinking, and it may not even be legal as described, though history suggests there are always ways to make things possible when incentives align. Can't wait for the IPO! TLDR: SPACE X will be a long-term buy and hold as they are building out the larger space infrastructure.",

Cant wait for the IPO TLDR SPACE X will be a longterm buy and hold as they are building out the larger space infrastructure ."

      "selftext": "I am 19 years old. I had around 50,000$ saved up and most of it was invested in the S&P 500. I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined, with my spending. I made sure to put my money into the S&P 500 because I thought it was an investment. A days ago I made a huge mistake. I did something wrong and it was all my fault. I totally messed things up with my actions. The mistake I made was an one. It happened a few days ago. I was trading options. I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day. Trading options can be really bad, for me I mean I was doing okay. Then I made some bad choices. Now I have lost a lot of my capital. I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading. The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it. I think about why I did it and that's what makes it worse. Doing it was bad. The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse. I was really close to making a mistake with my money. I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right.. Then I thought about it. I knew it was a bad idea. It was too risky and not very smart. So I did not do it. A few hours went by. Then I heard some news, about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland. If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars. I was lucky I did not make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons. The trade would have worked out well. It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right. I am glad I did not put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money. That really messed with my head. Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working. Seeing that was a shock, to me. I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right. That is when I started trading to get back at the market. I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good, for me. I did not have a plan. I was not managing my risk. I was only thinking about how I felt. I let my emotions take over. I was only thinking about revenge trading. My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone. I had a lot of money in my savings. Now half of my savings are just not there anymore. I feel sick. I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated. I just cannot stop thinking about what happened over in my head. My life is young. I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did. I keep thinking about my life. How I feel like I made a big mistake. My life and my choices are really bothering me. If anyone has gone through something like this. With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading. I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice, on options and gambling and revenge trading. • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without self-destructing again Right now, I feel completely lost. TL;DR: I’m 19. Had ~$50k saved (mostly S&P 500). Lost 50% of it in one day trading options after revenge trading. Missed a risky trade that would’ve turned $10k into ~$750k, got angry, abandoned discipline, and blew up half my savings. Now I feel devastated and like I ruined my life. Looking for advice on how to mentally recover and move forward.",

I have always tried to live in a way I worked and I saved my money and I tried to be very disciplined with my spending . I made sure to put my money into the SP 500 because I thought it was an investment . A days ago I made a huge mistake . I did something wrong and it was all my fault . I totally messed things up with my actions . The mistake I made was an one . It happened a few days ago . I was trading options . I lost a big part of my money fifty percent of my capital all in one day . Trading options can be really bad for me I mean I was doing okay . Then I made some bad choices . Now I have lost a lot of my capital . I am talking about options trading it is a risk I lost fifty percent of my capital in just one day of options trading . The thing that makes it worse is the reason I did it . I think about why I did it and thats what makes it worse . Doing it was bad . The reason I did the thing is what really makes it worse . I was really close to making a mistake with my money . I was going to put ten thousand dollars into an options trade because it felt right .. Then I thought about it . I knew it was a bad idea . It was too risky and not_very smart . So I did not_do it . A few hours went by . Then I heard some news about Trump and what he thinks about Greenland . If I had made that trade I would have gotten a lot of money seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars . I was lucky I did not_make that trade because I would have been doing it for the reasons . The trade would have worked out well . It was still a bad idea to do it just because it felt right . I am glad I did not_put my money into that options trade even though it would have made me a lot of money . That really messed with my head . Seeing that absolutely broke something in my head it was like my brain just stopped working . Seeing that was a shock to me . I was really mad at myself for missing that trade I kept thinking that I was right . That is when I started trading to get back at the market . I stopped doing all the things that I knew were good for me . I did not_have a plan . I was not_managing my risk . I was only thinking about how I felt . I let my emotions take over . I was only thinking about revenge trading . My savings have really taken a hit now half of my savings are gone . I had a lot of money in my savings . Now half of my savings are just not_there anymore . I feel sick . I am ashamed and I am honestly devastated . I just can not stop thinking about what happened over in my head . My life is young . I still have a lot of time but the way I feel right now is that I ruined my life and I threw away years of being good and working hard because of one really stupid thing I did . I keep thinking about my life . How I feel like I made a big mistake . My life and my choices are really bothering me . If anyone has gone through something like this . With options or gambling or trying to get back at the market by revenge trading . I would really appreciate it if you could give me some advice on options and gambling and revenge trading . • how to mentally recover • how to forgive yourself • and how to move forward without selfdestructing again Right now I feel completely lost . TLDR I ’ m 19 . Had $ 50k saved mostly SP 500 . Lost 50 % of it in one day trading options after revenge trading .

      "title": "Why it’s not too late to get in: The Asymmetric Case for Nebius ($NBIS)",
      "selftext": "*Current Price: \\~$95* *Market Capitalization: \\~$24B* *Recommendation: Long* While the broader market remains cautious, a quantitative dissection of the forward-looking order book suggests Nebius Group ($NBIS) is currently trading at a dislocation from its fundamental value. Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle. **1. The Velocity of Revenue Recognition** The market is currently pricing $NBIS based on trailing indicators, largely ignoring the contracted revenue ramp scheduled to materialize over the next 12–24 months. We are looking at a potential year-over-year revenue acceleration of 521% to 1,400% between 2025 and 2026. This is not a speculative forecast derived from TAM (Total Addressable Market) assumptions; it is a function of a $20B+ backlog of unfilled orders. Crucially, more than 50% of the company's projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts. \\* 2025E (Fiscal Year): Revenue of $500–550M; Exit ARR of $900M–$1.1B. \\* 2026E (Guidance): Revenue expands to $3.45–7B; ARR target of $7–9B. \\* 2027E (Consensus): Revenue projected at $7.8–9B. \\* 2028E: Revenue projected to exceed $14B. **2. Structural De-Risking Events** Three specific catalysts have recently materialized, effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity: \\* Product Maturity (AI Cloud 3.1): The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform, integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary \"Capacity Blocks,\" real-time dashboards, and compliance architecture, moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage. It positions the firm as a full-stack enterprise cloud alternative. \\* Infrastructure Scale: Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW. This physical capacity is the prerequisite \"supply\" needed to service the verified backlog. \\* Counterparty Quality: The backlog is anchored by multi-year infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta. These are long-duration commitments from investment-grade counterparties, not volatile usage-based revenue from venture-backed startups. **3. The Valuation Compression Thesis** Skeptics often cite the current \\~50x price-to-sales multiple (on 2025E revenue) as a barrier to entry. However, this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator (revenue) growth. As the backlog converts to recognized revenue, the optical valuation compresses rapidly: \\* 2026E: At the $3.45–7B revenue range, the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales. \\* 2027E: At the $9B consensus projection, the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales. Given the $4.79B cash position on the balance sheet, the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk. **4. Price Target Sensitivity Analysis** Applying standard growth-adjusted multiples to the company's guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade. From a cost basis of $95, the potential upside scenarios are substantial. (Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header). **5. Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price** A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action. At $95, shares are trading 40% below the average analyst price target and 55% below the street-high target. \\* Northland Securities: $211 (122% Upside) \\* Citizens JMP: $175 (84% Upside) \\* Consensus Mean: $157.83 (66% Upside) \\* Sentiment: 5 Buys / 1 Hold / 0 Sells **Summary** The retracement from the October highs of $141 provides an attractive entry point. Fundamental performance remains robust, evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $146.1M (+355% YoY) and core infrastructure growth of +400%. With a clear path to $5B+ in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $20B+ backlog, I view $NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage. I remain a buyer at these levels. *Disclaimer: This analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.* **If you like my posts, please also take a look at my Substack in bio.**",

      "selftext_processed": "Current Price $ 95 Market Capitalization $ 24B Recommendation Long While the broader market remains cautious a quantitative dissection of the forwardlooking order book suggests Nebius Group $ NBIS is currently trading at a dislocation from its fundamental value . Below is the thesis for why Nebius represents a highly asymmetric infrastructure trade for the 2026 cycle . 1 . The Velocity of Revenue Recognition The market is currently pricing $ NBIS based on trailing indicators largely ignoring the contracted revenue ramp scheduled to materialize over the next 12–24 months . We are looking at a potential yearoveryear revenue acceleration of 521 % to 1400 % between 2025 and 2026 . This is not_a speculative forecast derived from TAM Total Addressable Market assumptions it is a function of a $ 20B backlog of unfilled orders . Crucially more than 50 % of the companys projected 2026 ARR is already locked in via binding contracts . 2025E Fiscal Year Revenue of $ 500–550M Exit ARR of $ 900M– $ 1.1B . 2026E Guidance Revenue expands to $ 3.45–7B ARR target of $ 7–9B . 2027E Consensus Revenue projected at $ 7.8–9B . 2028E Revenue projected to exceed $ 14B . 2 . Structural DeRisking Events Three specific catalysts have recently materialized effectively transforming the risk profile of the equity Product Maturity AI Cloud 3.1 The January 2026 launch of the AI Cloud 3.1 platform integrating Nvidia Blackwell GPUs with proprietary Capacity Blocks realtime dashboards and compliance architecture moves Nebius beyond simple GPU arbitrage . It positions the firm as a fullstack enterprise cloud alternative . Infrastructure Scale Management has revised its 2026 contracted power capacity target upward from 1 GW to 2.5 GW . This physical capacity is the prerequisite supply needed to service the verified backlog . Counterparty Quality The backlog is anchored by multiyear infrastructure agreements with Microsoft and Meta . These are longduration commitments from investmentgrade counterparties not_volatile usagebased revenue from venturebacked startups . 3 . The Valuation Compression Thesis Skeptics often cite the current 50x pricetosales multiple on 2025E revenue as a barrier to entry . However this view fails to account for the velocity of the denominator revenue growth . As the backlog converts to recognized revenue the optical valuation compresses rapidly 2026E At the $ 3.45–7B revenue range the multiple compresses to 7–13x sales . 2027E At the $ 9B consensus projection the multiple compresses to 4–5x sales . Given the $ 4.79B cash position on the balance sheet the company is fully capitalized to execute this growth phase without immediate dilution risk . 4 . Price Target Sensitivity Analysis Applying standard growthadjusted multiples to the companys guidance illustrates the convexity of the trade . From a cost basis of $ 95 the potential upside scenarios are substantial . Calculations on potential price see the photo in the header . 5 . Institutional Consensus vs. Market Price A distinct gap exists between institutional pricing models and current market action . At $ 95 shares are trading 40 % below the average analyst price target and 55 % below the streethigh target . Northland Securities $ 211 122 % Upside Citizens JMP $ 175 84 % Upside Consensus Mean $ 157.83 66 % Upside Sentiment 5 Buys 1 Hold 0 Sells Summary The retracement from the October highs of $ 141 provides an attractive entry point . Fundamental performance remains robust evidenced by Q3 2025 revenue of $ 146.1M 355 % YoY and core infrastructure growth of 400 % . With a clear path to $ 5B in EBITDA by 2027 and a verified $ 20B backlog I view $ NBIS as the premier infrastructure play for the 2026 vintage . I remain a buyer at these levels .

For context: Both Roth IRAs are already maxed separately (not included below). I’m aiming for long-term growth, tax efficiency, and some liquidity. Employer retirement accounts include a mix of Traditional and Roth with matches (2 jobs) Here is the percentage-only breakdown of my current plan: (50k to play with) Account Type % Distribution Employee 401(k) – Traditional 17% Employee 401(k) – Roth 5% Employee 403(b) – Traditional 17% Employee 403(b) – Roth 5% Employee Stock Purchase Plan (10% discount sell immediately add to next year ROTH IRA) 33% High-Yield Savings Account. 5% Taxable Brokerage Account 17% Total: 100% My main questions: Should I shift more toward brokerage or retirement accounts? Would you rebalance Traditional vs Roth differently? Other that I am missing? Any feedback is welcome! 🙏🏻",

How do you guys view the auto parts industry for EV and non-ev vehicles ? I have listed down some auto parts company ORLY AUTOZONE GPC I am looking for market leaders or hidden gems.

      "selftext": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the likes incorrectly estimated that the S&P500 would beat the FTSE100 in 2025, I believe the same fundamental's that caused this will still exist in 2026. 1. Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28. This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends. 2. AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year. 3. Long Term Stability Trump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe. On the otherside, a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further. 4. Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5. USD Decline Even if European stocks do not intrinsically outperform the S&P 500, every time the world is graced with another truth social post, the USD falls. The USD was down 10% in 2025. 6. Trumpism As an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different? If threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4? In the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health: \\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines) \\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs) \\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps. \\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. TLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action. I am not saying go 0% US, but if you are sitting 100% US, maybe now is time to consider diversifying.",

Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average PE ratio versus the SP500s with an average PE of 17 to the SPs 28 . This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack . British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years and will still provide their relatively larger dividends . 2 . AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble . US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year . 3 . Long Term Stability Trumps stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics . The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe . On the otherside a potenitally bias Fed chair in the US will tip the scales further . 4 . Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europes overregulation . This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape 5 . USD Decline Even if European stocks do not_intrinsically outperform the SP 500 every time the world is graced with another truth social post the USD falls . The USD was down 10 % in 2025 . 6 . Trumpism As an outsider with no_skin in the game I was concerned watching Bidens performance degrade over his term . Did Bidens health and performance improve over his presidency Why would President Trumps be any different If threatening to invade allies is Trumps Year 1 how exposed do I want to be to his year 4 In the FTSE your portfolio will be better insulated from Trumps degrading mental health You are not_going to have your stocks key product banned overnight wind turbines Or key manufaturing imports tariffed Canadas automotive imputs Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps . For as long as Trump is in power he is unpredictable but predictably more volatile as he gets older . TLDR I am bullish on Europe because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans or scaring the Europeans into action . I am not_saying go 0 % US but if you are sitting 100 % US maybe now is time to consider diversifying ."

It’s literally part of my compensation. Yet if I need it before some arbitrary age, I get punished with penalties and extra taxes like I committed a crime. People always say “it’s for your own good” or “it stops people from being irresponsible.” That’s not the government’s job. Adults should be allowed to make decisions, even bad ones, with their own money. If someone wants to save it for retirement, great. If someone needs it for a house, medical bills, starting a business, or just surviving, that should be their choice. What makes it even worse is that the rules are insanely complex. Hardship withdrawals, loans, exceptions, age limits, penalties, income tax stacked on top. It’s like the system is designed to scare people into never touching their own money unless they play by exact rules. If the government wants to encourage retirement savings, fine. Give tax incentives. But once the money is earned and deposited, it shouldn’t be locked behind penalties and fine print for decades. It’s not a retirement account anymore. It’s a leash.",

      "selftext": "JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and the likes incorrectly estimated that the S&P500 would beat the FTSE100 in 2025, I believe the same fundamental's that caused this will still exist in 2026. 1. Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average P/E ratio versus the S&P500s, with an average P/E of 17 to the S&P's 28. This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack. British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years, and will still provide their relatively larger dividends. 2. AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble. US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year. 3. Long Term Stability Trump's stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics. The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election, is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe. 4. Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europe's overregulation. This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape. 5. Trumpism As an outsider with no skin in the game I was concerned watching Biden's performance degrade over his term. Did Biden's health and performance improve over his presidency? Why would President Trump's be any different? If threatening to invade allies is Trump's Year 1, how exposed do I want to be to his year 4? In the FTSE, your portfolio will be better insulated from Trump's degrading mental health: \\-You are not going to have your stock's key product banned overnight (wind turbines) \\-Or key manufaturing imports tariffed (Canada's automotive imputs) \\-Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps. \\-For as long as Trump is in power, he is unpredictable, but predictably more volatile as he gets older. TLDR; I am bullish on Europe, because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans, or scaring the Europeans into action. I am not saying go 0% US, but if you are sitting 100% US, maybe now is time to consider diversifying.",

Value Matters British Stocks have a lower average PE ratio versus the SP500s with an average PE of 17 to the SPs 28 . This is typically due to lower growth estimates and a smaller tech stack . British infrastructure stocks have announced record investment in recent years and will still provide their relatively larger dividends . 2 . AI Insulation The IMF issued a warning this week about the effect of a pop in a potential AI bubble . US stocks are of course the most exposed to any potential AI downside and are relying on strong earnings reports this year . 3 . Long Term Stability Trumps stance on Greenland has provided a unifying point for European politics . The effect Trump had on switching the outcome of the latest Canadian election is being seen to a lesser extent across nations in Europe . 4 . Improving Regulatory Outlook At Davos this week Macron highlighted Europes overregulation . This being brought up so publicly creates positive sentiment towards improved offerings across the continent and highlights recent genuine measures to cut red tape . 5 . Trumpism As an outsider with no_skin in the game I was concerned watching Bidens performance degrade over his term . Did Bidens health and performance improve over his presidency Why would President Trumps be any different If threatening to invade allies is Trumps Year 1 how exposed do I want to be to his year 4 In the FTSE your portfolio will be better insulated from Trumps degrading mental health You are not_going to have your stocks key product banned overnight wind turbines Or key manufaturing imports tariffed Canadas automotive imputs Nor will you be caught on the wrong side of one of their more apparent government back pump and dumps . For as long as Trump is in power he is unpredictable but predictably more volatile as he gets older . TLDR I am bullish on Europe because Trumps degrading of American assets is either directly benefiting the Europeans or scaring the Europeans into action . I am not_saying go 0 % US but if you are sitting 100 % US maybe now is time to consider diversifying ."

      "selftext": "Before anything: I believe that AI is currently a bubble. Despite it growing in use day after day, it still isn't a full replaceable tool for most tasks. It feels intelligent, but it is still clunky and unreliable for a lot of things. I'm not pretending to understand more than the others, but I have noticed a pattern that has been proving itself true for a while. I believe that AI has reached to a point where it became too present to be a common bubble. The triggers for it are becoming more and more hard to achieve in the close future. The big companies are pumping money into eachother, but in the end they are actually *gambling* against eachother. They are putting money on the game, hoping to snatch away from the first one who falls on the race. Take OpenAI as an example. Had they declared a poor financial state by 2023, the bubble would had bursted far more quickly, because at the time they were pretty much the only big AI company. If they lose relevance nowadays, we still have other companies on the game. There will be a moment of fear, but it won't last long. For example, Gemini isn't the only Google product (and I argue that it isn't even their biggest spending). GOGL would take a hit, but there still would have reason to buy their stocks. On regard to the GPU producers, the main difference between the dot com bubble and this one is that now they have many other uses for it. Companies need computing power for LLMs, but they also need it for cloud storage and many other uses. Besides, every AI company is racing for AGI. When this happens, I seriously believe the bubble could be called down. My main point on this all is that it *may* happen, but now a lot of things should happen in sequence to trigger the bubble. And even if it is the case, it wouldn't pop suddenly. People are aware enough of it, and the tech stocks are extremely sensible (just look at Intel this week), so basically the market is correcting itself enough to avoid an uncontrolled overvaluation. It's precisely the fear that is regulating the size of the bubble. No one is buying NVDA like there is no tomorrow, like they did with Cisco in 2001. And even considering all that, and even if the bubble bursts suddenly, it's not science fiction to think that by 2040 and onwards AI will be thousands of times more powerful.",

      "selftext_processed": "Before anything I believe that AI is currently a bubble . Despite it growing in use day after day it still isnt a full replaceable tool for most tasks . It feels intelligent but it is still clunky and unreliable for a lot of things . Im not_pretending to understand more than the others but I have noticed a pattern that has been proving itself true for a while . I believe that AI has reached to a point where it became too present to be a common bubble . The triggers for it are becoming more and more hard to achieve in the close future . The big companies are pumping money into eachother but in the end they are actually gambling against eachother . They are putting money on the game hoping to snatch away from the first one who falls on the race . Take OpenAI as an example . Had they declared a poor financial state by 2023 the bubble would had bursted far more quickly because at the time they were pretty much the only big AI company . If they lose relevance nowadays we still have other companies on the game . There will be a moment of fear but it wont last long . For example Gemini isnt the only Google product and I argue that it isnt even their biggest spending . GOGL would take a hit but there still would have reason to buy their stocks . On regard to the GPU producers the main difference between the dot com bubble and this one is that now they have many other uses for it . Companies need computing power for LLMs but they also need it for cloud storage and many other uses . Besides every AI company is racing for AGI . When this happens I seriously believe the bubble could be called down . My main point on this all is that it may happen but now a lot of things should happen in sequence to trigger the bubble . And even if it is the case it wouldnt pop suddenly . People are aware enough of it and the tech stocks are extremely sensible just look at Intel this week so basically the market is correcting itself enough to avoid an uncontrolled overvaluation . Its precisely the fear that is regulating the size of the bubble . No_one is buying NVDA like there is no_tomorrow like they did with Cisco in 2001 . And even considering all that and even if the bubble bursts suddenly its not_science fiction to think that by 2040 and onwards AI will be thousands of times more powerful ."

      "selftext": "It is not clear to me why anyone should continue to own U.S. assets. Yes, U.S. capital markets are deep, and many American companies are exceptional, but the political risk assumed by owning American assets today outweighs the benefit of participating in an economy governed by a mad king with no apparent restraints or accountability of any kind. At this point, any person or entity investing in the U.S. is directly (U.S. Treasuries) or indirectly (U.S. private assets) enabling the Trump regime to inflict incalculable damage on the world order, not to mention running the risk of having their assets confiscated or stranded due to some flimsy political or security excuse. Countries not subject to the rule of law, such as the United States,.represent a clear and imminent danger to all those exposed to them. As such, investing in the United States today is both more morally questionable and more financially irresponsible. What guarantee do Canadian or European investors have today that their U.S. stock or bond holdings won’t be subject to severe taxation by executive order? Think “Greenland Security Reparations”? Or a “North America Golden Dome Funding Charge”? Anything is possible when the individual in charge is unhinged and faces no apparent democratic oversight. Meanwhile, I would think twice about owning gold or silver in the U.S. today. Should the U.S. dollar continue to weaken and these hard assets continue to rally, Trump may deem their ascent an affront to the supremacy of the U.S. dollar and outlaw private ownership. And don’t think this hasn’t happened before (see Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 6102). Finally, with Trump turning the U.S. into a global pariah, what do you think will happen to U.S. companies’ sales abroad over time? Consumers and governments around the world will undoubtedly increasingly shun U.S. technology (to the extent possible) and U.S. consumer and industrial products and services in favor of national or other non-U.S. alternatives. And with over 40% of S&P 500 companies’ revenues coming from international markets, the hit to their bottom lines will be felt. I, for one, sold my last U.S. stock in Q4 last year. I recommend that you do the same.",

At this point any person or entity investing in the U.S. is directly U.S. Treasuries or indirectly U.S. private assets enabling the Trump regime to inflict incalculable damage on the world order not_to mention running the risk of having their assets confiscated or stranded due to some flimsy political or security excuse . Countries not_subject to the rule of law such as the United States.represent a clear and imminent danger to all those exposed to them . As such investing in the United States today is both more morally questionable and more financially irresponsible . What guarantee do Canadian or European investors have today that their U.S. stock or bond holdings won ’ t be subject to severe taxation by executive order Think “ Greenland Security Reparations ” Or a “ North America Golden Dome Funding Charge ” Anything is possible when the individual in charge is unhinged and faces no_apparent democratic oversight . Meanwhile I would think twice about owning gold or silver in the U.S. today . Should the U.S. dollar continue to weaken and these hard assets continue to rally Trump may deem their ascent an affront to the supremacy of the U.S. dollar and outlaw private ownership . And don ’ t think this hasn ’ t happened before see Franklin D. Roosevelt ’ s Executive Order 6102 . Finally with Trump turning the U.S. into a global pariah what do you think will happen to U.S. companies ’ sales abroad over time Consumers and governments around the world will undoubtedly increasingly shun U.S. technology to the extent possible and U.S. consumer and industrial products and services in favor of national or other nonU.S . alternatives . And with over 40 % of SP 500 companies ’ revenues coming from international markets the hit to their bottom lines will be felt . I for one sold my last U.S. stock in Q4 last year . I recommend that you do the same ."

      "title": "When Gold Rips: Rethinking “Safe” Assets (S&P500 vs Gold vs Real Estate)",
      "selftext": "Imagine you have $100,000 in 2013 and you need to decide what to invest in. Here are a few options: \\- A 1-bedroom condo in a Boston suburb, which was priced around $110,000 is now close to $350,000 in value, resulting in a 3.18x return (or approximately $318,000 after normalization). \\- Gold, which was priced around $1,200 per ounce, increased to $4,000 per ounce, resulting in a 3.33x return (or approximately $333,000). \\- VOO, which was around $140, increased to $636, resulting in a 4.54x return (or approximately $454,000, based solely on price appreciation). Based on this 2013-2026 investment window, stocks appear to be the better option compared to gold and real estate. However, with gold currently priced at around $4,000 per ounce, it raises questions about the notion that stocks are always the safest long-term investment. My perspective is that the belief in the safety of investing in gold and land is often driven by a desire for stress relief and control, rather than solely by the potential for returns. Stocks can be emotionally challenging due to market fluctuations and news headlines, but they offer a relatively straightforward investment strategy with the ability to set and forget through index funds. Real estate, while potentially more stable on a day-to-day basis, can be illiquid and requires ongoing maintenance and management, such as HOA fees, repairs, and property taxes. Gold, on the other hand, is relatively easy to hold, but it lacks the potential for compounding returns and can experience significant price volatility over extended periods. I wonder if there are other factors that I may be overlooking, such as the impact of dividends, the potential for real estate leverage and rental income, or the influence of taxes on investment returns. I am not even thinking about NASDAQ stocks QQQ, which had much higher returns nor crypto. I’m just thinking like a long-term safe investor and not like a super nerdy stock market guy, which are very few who know when to get in and when get out. .",

Trump, referring to Prime Minister Mark Carney as “Governor Carney,” said Canada was “sorely mistaken” for allowing China to increase its imports of electric vehicles. Trump has trolled Canada about his desire for it to become the 51st US state. “China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life,” Trump said in a social media post. “If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all",

      "selftext": "*I would like to preface this by saying I had attempted to post this on or around December 31, 2025 but was unable due to account newness.* *As a result I'm posting this now, despite not being as fresh-to-market news, to ensure those who are looking into FinTech in the current landscape are aware of the risks present.* \\------- Dave Inc. (DAVE) has recently received a significant threat to its business model as of December 30, 2025. \\***Judicial and regulatory bodies are beginning to clamp down on predatory FinTech practices which are being masked as voluntary contributions, charitable tips, and fees & charges.**\\* \\*\\***The small news that skipped headlines (but with a big cascade risk) is the Baltimore v Dave Inc lawsuit filed December 30, 2025**\\*\\* If the Baltimore City lawsuit (filed December 30, 2025) successfully argues that these charges are \"finance charges\" under 12 C.F.R. § 1026.4 (Regulation Z), Dave’s effective APR (often exceeding 400%) would violate Maryland’s 33% usury cap and significantly impact Dave's bottom line, profitability and business model. This follows the precedent in District of Columbia v. EarnIn (Nov. 2024), where the DC Attorney General sued a near-identical provider for charging fees that yielded a 300% APR, rejecting the defense that these payments were voluntary \"donations.\" \\**This led to the case law and precedent referred to as \\*EarnIn doctrine\\* that donations are not voluntary, and fees are part of the loan*.\\* \\**Critically*\\* the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) Regulatory integration of the doctrine into the 2024 Interpretive Rule. This regulation has been refined in \\*\\*December 2025\\*\\* enforcing the interpretation that \"tips\" and \"expedited delivery fees\" are considered \"credit\" subject to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) if they are part and parcel of the extension of funds. DAVE and other FinTech/BNPL/Advance lenders rely on state Safe Harbor laws to bypass APR limits currently. Other lenders are also getting rapidly hit by agencies (California DFPI v OppFi, Baltimore v MoneyLion, 2025, New York AG v MoneyLion, CFPB v MoneyLion, DC v EarnIn 2025, FTC v CleoAI, Rubin v EarnIn, Aug 2025, and the number of lawsuits are increasing) The problem? \\*\\***More Precedents!\\***\\* City of Miami v. Gonzalez (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2025), which went to Court of Appeals final ruling established that municipal charters can empower cities to enforce local consumer protections even where state laws are permissive, effectively allowing Baltimore to and other cities to ignore state level permission laws \\*AND apply the EarnIn Doctrine\\*. As a double whammy, the DOJ is naming CEO Jason Wilk as a personal defendant in its amended complaint (Dec. 2025), which is almost a replica of the FTC v Brigit 2024 case, where Brigit had to pay a $18 million settlement for deceptive fee-harvesting interfaces \\*\\**AND a permanent injunction*\\*\\*. CleoAI also had to settle a case with conditions against the FTC for $17M. On an ethical and legal front, recent revelations of exploiting \"charitable\" nudges to the bottom line $149 million tip revenue, Dave is increasingly exposed to a multi-front wave of municipal and federal litigation, and also souring retail & ethical sentiment. If these revenue drivers are deemed illegal interest, Dave loses its primary margin engine. Its core revenue generator turns into an unlicensed, high-interest loan. A single 40k share institutional sell block on Dec 29 over a holiday trading period immediately following the news, is a warning signal investors might want to be aware of if currently holding a DAVE position. While some risk is built into the current price, a bigger downside risk exists if multiple city & state jurisdictions follow Baltimore's lead - possibility of numerous settlements, restrictions and injunctions can potentially severely cripple the business model. \\**Disclaimer: Previous Dave bull here. I post this to help ensure I give a transparent take on any stocks I have held or hold, especially when I see big regulatory headwinds, as I don't want others to get burnt on a stock. I have exited DAVE due to this increasing risk. Not AI*\\*",

      "selftext_processed": "I would like to preface this by saying I had attempted to post this on or around December 31 2025 but was unable due to account newness . As a result Im posting this now despite not_being as freshtomarket news to ensure those who are looking into FinTech in the current landscape are aware of the risks present . Dave Inc. DAVE has recently received a significant threat to its business model as of December 30 2025 . Judicial and regulatory bodies are beginning to clamp down on predatory FinTech practices which are being masked as voluntary contributions charitable tips and fees charges . The small news that skipped headlines but with a big cascade risk is the Baltimore v Dave Inc lawsuit filed December 30 2025 If the Baltimore City lawsuit filed December 30 2025 successfully argues that these charges are finance charges under 12 C.F.R . § 1026.4 Regulation Z Dave ’ s effective APR often exceeding 400 % would violate Maryland ’ s 33 % usury cap and significantly impact Daves bottom line profitability and business model . This follows the precedent in District of Columbia v. EarnIn Nov. 2024 where the DC Attorney General sued a nearidentical provider for charging fees that yielded a 300 % APR rejecting the defense that these payments were voluntary donations . This led to the case law and precedent referred to as EarnIn doctrine that donations are not_voluntary and fees are part of the loan . Critically the Consumer Financial Protection Bureaus CFPB Regulatory integration of the doctrine into the 2024 Interpretive Rule . This regulation has been refined in December 2025 enforcing the interpretation that tips and expedited delivery fees are considered credit subject to the Truth in Lending Act TILA if they are part and parcel of the extension of funds . DAVE and other FinTechBNPLAdvance lenders rely on state Safe Harbor laws to bypass APR limits currently . Other lenders are also getting rapidly hit by agencies California DFPI v OppFi Baltimore v MoneyLion 2025 New York AG v MoneyLion CFPB v MoneyLion DC v EarnIn 2025 FTC v CleoAI Rubin v EarnIn Aug 2025 and the number of lawsuits are increasing The problem More Precedents City of Miami v. Gonzalez Fla. Dist . Ct. App . 2025 which went to Court of Appeals final ruling established that municipal charters can empower cities to enforce local consumer protections even where state laws are permissive effectively allowing Baltimore to and other cities to ignore state level permission laws AND apply the EarnIn Doctrine . As a double whammy the DOJ is naming CEO Jason Wilk as a personal defendant in its amended complaint Dec. 2025 which is almost a replica of the FTC v Brigit 2024 case where Brigit had to pay a $ 18 million settlement for deceptive feeharvesting interfaces AND a permanent injunction . CleoAI also had to settle a case with conditions against the FTC for $ 17M . On an ethical and legal front recent revelations of exploiting charitable nudges to the bottom line $ 149 million tip revenue Dave is increasingly exposed to a multifront wave of municipal and federal litigation and also souring retail ethical sentiment . If these revenue drivers are deemed illegal interest Dave loses its primary margin engine . Its core revenue generator turns into an unlicensed highinterest loan . A single 40k share institutional sell block on Dec 29 over a holiday trading period immediately following the news is a warning signal investors might want to be aware of if currently holding a DAVE position . While some risk is built into the current price a bigger downside risk exists if multiple city state jurisdictions follow Baltimores lead possibility of numerous settlements restrictions and injunctions can potentially severely cripple the business model . Disclaimer Previous Dave bull here . I post this to help ensure I give a transparent take on any stocks I have held or hold especially when I see big regulatory headwinds as I dont want others to get burnt on a stock . I have exited DAVE due to this increasing risk . Not_AI"

      "selftext": "I recently heard the speech from PM Carney at Davos, and I found it superbly impactful. politics aside, it was a great speech. The second thing that came to mind for me after hearing it was what investing takeaways can I get from this speech? So with the help of a friendly bot, I have the following stocks: # Theme 1: Energy Security & “Friendly Supply” # Investment Implications Expect **long-duration capital flows** into Canadian energy that can: * Export reliably * Operate under ESG scrutiny * Survive political cycles # Opportunities * **Canadian Natural Resources** * Long-life assets, low decline rates * Massive free cash flow * Fits “reliable supplier” narrative * **Suncor Energy** * Integrated model = resilience * Energy security + refining leverage * **Enbridge** * Tolls > commodity prices * Exactly the “plumbing of geopolitics” Carney is hinting at **Portfolio role:** Core income + geopolitical hedge # Theme 2: Critical Minerals & Strategic Commodities # Investment Implications Canada wants to be a **non-China minerals hub** for: * EVs * Defense * AI infrastructure # Opportunities * **Teck Resources** * Copper + zinc = electrification backbone * Already repositioning toward future-facing metals * **Lundin Mining** * Copper-heavy portfolio * Direct beneficiary of buyer-club dynamics * **Lithium Americas** * Geopolitically sensitive asset class * Binary risk, but massive upside if policy aligns **Portfolio role:** Strategic growth, policy-levered upside # Theme 3: Financial Infrastructure & Capital Markets Power # Investment Implications * Increased global capital routing through Canadian banks * Demand for **risk-managed, boring financial systems** * Stable dividend growth # Opportunities * **Royal Bank of Canada** * Global reach + conservative balance sheet * Wins in volatile geopolitics * **Brookfield Corporation** * Infrastructure, energy transition, real assets * Basically a *financial expression* of Carney’s worldview **Portfolio role:** Defensive growth + global optionality # Theme 4: AI Governance, Data, and “Trusted Tech” # Investment Implications * Demand for data centers * Regulated AI platforms * Enterprise software aligned with compliance # Opportunities * **Constellation Software** * Vertical market software * Benefits from regulation, not hurt by it * **OpenText** * Data governance, compliance, security * Quiet winner in AI regulation era **Portfolio role:** Low-hype AI exposure with real cash flow # Theme 5: Defense, NATO, and Northern Security # Investment Implications * Arctic security * Aerospace * Surveillance and systems integration # Opportunities * **CAE** * Military flight simulation * NATO-aligned budgets = steady demand * **MDA** * Space-based surveillance * Arctic monitoring relevance rising fast **Portfolio role:** Geopolitical hedge + tech-adjacent defenseTheme 1: Energy Security & “Friendly Supply” The only stocks I currently own that would be considered Canadian are MDA (MDALF), and FFMGF. I will spend some time this seeking researching these names. I'd like to hear what you all think about this idea of investing into Canada after this speech, and if you are doing the same, what type of stocks are you going for?",

The plan is to dollar cost average a small amount every week and hold for 20 plus years with no trading or market timing. This is meant to be a buy and forget hedge alongside equities. For gold, I’m specifically looking at GLD versus IAU. For silver, I’m looking at SLV versus SLVR. I’m mainly concerned with long term reliability, expense ratios, liquidity, tracking accuracy, and any structural risks that could matter over decades. For someone taking a steady weekly DCA approach over a very long time horizon, which gold ETF and which silver ETF would you choose and why?",

      "selftext": "Gold and Silver up recently. Danger territory, it can grow further or decline. If positions closed now the current profit will be locked, but the **future profit missed**. What to do? (no good solution for Silver) **Gold**: protect with puts x0.85 6months. Puts are cheap, good solution. Won't protect against slow and long decline though. **Silver**: no good solution, options are very, very, very expensive. **1)** Close 50-100% of silver positions and move it into Gold protected with puts. **2)** Explosive hedge. Buy large volume (x4 of stock volume), of cheap far otm puts x0.5 4months. Won't help in small-medium decline. But for large sudden drop could go x10 and reduce losses. **3)** Close silver positions and move to silver miners (say WPM). They say silver miners are not yet fully appreciate silver metal up move, so for silver miners the upside potential could be higher. Silver Miners are more reactive than the silver, both up and down. Yet - strangely, puts on miners are a little bit cheaper than puts on silver. So strange situations - more volatile with higher up potential and with cheaper puts. I think at least 30% of silver positions should be closed and go into silver miners protected with puts. Still puts are very costly. **4)** Close silver positions, use 5-10% of money to buy WPM call x1.5 1-2years. The call is insanely costly and would go almost to zero with medium decline, yet 90% of silver profit will stay safe and there will be some exposure to future up move. I have been thinking about this for days, can't decide what to do with silver, any **better ideas**? Note - in my opinion options are better on GLD/SLV because of high liquidity. Yet for positions it's safer to use PHYS/PSLV or miners stocks.",

What to do no good solution for Silver Gold protect with puts x0.85 6months . Puts are cheap good solution . Wont protect against slow and long decline though . Silver no_good solution options are very very very expensive . 1 Close 50100 % of silver positions and move it into Gold protected with puts . 2 Explosive hedge . Buy large volume x4 of stock volume of cheap far otm puts x0.5 4months . Wont help in smallmedium decline . But for large sudden drop could go x10 and reduce losses . 3 Close silver positions and move to silver miners say WPM . They say silver miners are not_yet fully appreciate silver metal up move so for silver miners the upside potential could be higher . Silver Miners are more reactive than the silver both up and down . Yet strangely puts on miners are a little bit cheaper than puts on silver . So strange situations more volatile with higher up potential and with cheaper puts . I think at least 30 % of silver positions should be closed and go into silver miners protected with puts . Still puts are very costly . 4 Close silver positions use 510 % of money to buy WPM call x1.5 12years . The call is insanely costly and would go almost to zero with medium decline yet 90 % of silver profit will stay safe and there will be some exposure to future up move . I have been thinking about this for days cant decide what to do with silver any better ideas Note in my opinion options are better on GLDSLV because of high liquidity . Yet for positions its safer to use PHYSPSLV or miners stocks ."

My retirement accounts currently reflect that target. However, I also have some VTI (VTSAX, Total Stock Market Index) in a taxable account. I don't want to sell that taxable-account VTI to actually reallocate it to VOO, VB, and VTV. (I don't want to trigger capital gains now.) However, I would like to factor that VTI in to my asset allocation (that is, in my retirement accounts, reduce each of VOO, VB, and VTV holdings a bit, since VTI overlaps with those (and increase the other securities correspondingly)). What percentages of VOO, VB, and VTV is VTI roughly equivalent to? If I'm not missing something, VTI is equivalent to some amounts of VOO, VB, and VTV, plus some of whatever VTI covers but those three do not. (Right?) Does anyone here know, or can anyone tell how to find out or compute, those proportions of VOO, VB, and VTV, and that uncovered portion? (Or just: What fractions of the VTI should I consider as counting toward the VOO allocation, the VB allocation, and the VTV allocation? I know it can't be exactly equivalent (since VTI contains things not in funds in my target allocation); I'm just looking for a first-order approximation.) Thanks.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been digging a bit more into META recently and something stood out when I looked at earnings over the last several quarters. Actual EPS has consistently come in above expectations, and forward estimates haven’t rolled over going into the next report (Jan 28). At META’s scale, that kind of sustained earnings momentum feels harder to dismiss than a one-off beat. I’m not ignoring valuation here META isn’t cheap on traditional multiples but the earnings trajectory looks stronger than the broader narrative I still see around the stock. What I’ve found helpful is tracking earnings vs expectations over time (I use Blossom to visualize this across quarters), because it makes it easier to separate short-term price noise from underlying execution. For those who follow META or large-cap tech more generally: Do you still weigh earnings momentum heavily at this size? Or does valuation dominate once companies reach this scale?[](",

      "selftext": "I have the 4/17 $4 calls and shares Talkspace Inc. (NASDAQ: TALK) is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform, offering text, audio, and video sessions. The company has successfully pivoted from a direct-to-consumer model to a payer-centric strategy, which has significantly driven its recent growth. Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $59.4 million, up 25% year-over-year, with payer revenue growing 42%. The company has achieved profitability, posting positive EPS of $0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $3.35 million. Management narrowed full-year 2025 revenue guidance to $226–$230 million, implying 20–23% year-over-year growth, and expects at least 20% growth to continue into 2026. Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum, with active payer members increasing 29% year-over-year to over 120,000 in Q3 2025. Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies, educational institutions, and nonprofits across North America. Analyst sentiment remains highly positive, with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity ($6 price target), Needham ($5), and KeyBanc ($5), representing meaningful upside from current levels. Investments in AI, including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an in-house AI chatbot in 2026, position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space. Risks include high valuation multiples, competitive pressures, and gross margin compression from increased payer mix. Despite this, strong cash reserves, sustained revenue growth, and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable long-term outlook.",

NASDAQ TALK is a virtual behavioral health company that connects users with licensed therapists and psychiatrists through its digital platform offering text audio and video sessions . The company has successfully pivoted from a directtoconsumer model to a payercentric strategy which has significantly driven its recent growth . Talkspace reported Q3 2025 revenue of $ 59.4 million up 25 % yearoveryear with payer revenue growing 42 % . The company has achieved profitability posting positive EPS of $ 0.03 over the last twelve months and EBITDA of $ 3.35 million . Management narrowed fullyear 2025 revenue guidance to $ 226– $ 230 million implying 20–23 % yearoveryear growth and expects at least 20 % growth to continue into 2026 . Strengthening payer relationships have been key to this momentum with active payer members increasing 29 % yearoveryear to over 120000 in Q3 2025 . Talkspace is expanding through additional payer integrations expected by Q1 2026 and renewed its Sourcewell cooperative purchasing contract to serve government agencies educational institutions and nonprofits across North America . Analyst sentiment remains highly positive with Buy ratings from Canaccord Genuity $ 6 price target Needham $ 5 and KeyBanc $ 5 representing meaningful upside from current levels . Investments in AI including proprietary risk algorithms and plans for an inhouse AI chatbot in 2026 position Talkspace well for continued innovation in the digital mental health space . Risks include high valuation multiples competitive pressures and gross margin compression from increased payer mix . Despite this strong cash reserves sustained revenue growth and a strategic focus on payer relationships support a favorable longterm outlook ."

      "selftext": "The ongoing proceedings have confirmed that Google’s \"Play Store\" dominance is being challenged not just on a monetary basis (the 30% fee), but on a technical infrastructure level. The court is focused on the \"friction\" Google creates to prevent third-party app stores and direct installations. 1. The Risk for Google ($GOOGL): Google’s high-margin Services segment relies on the \"toll-gate\" model. If the judge enforces the October Injunction (as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing), Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system. \"Scare Screens\" Ban: The court is moving toward banning the \"warning\" messages users see when side-loading apps. This removes Google’s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition. Google is under fire for trying to implement \"security fees\" to replace lost commissions. The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that aren't based on actual marginal costs. 2. The Opportunity for Digital Turbine ($APPS): The SingleTap Patent Moat: During the trial, it was revealed that Epic conducted A/B testing with Digital Turbine. The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT’s \"frictionless\" installation technology compared to Google’s standard flow. As the \"Gatekeeper\" walls fall, third-party stores (Xbox Mobile, Epic Store, Meta Direct Ads) need a delivery mechanism. Digital Turbine’s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally. The \"March 2026\" Inflection Point: With the judge rejecting a \"sweetheart deal\" between Google and Epic on Jan 22, the original, more aggressive injunction remains the baseline. This paves the way for a massive scaling of installations/day for DT starting in H2 2026. 3. The Epic Games Factor: Epic isn't just fighting for Fortnite; they are fighting for the right to run a full-scale mobile marketplace. Their reliance on DT’s tech during testing proves that the \"Alternative Distribution\" market is ready for commercial scale. The market is currently pricing in \"uncertainty,\" but the technical filings suggest a structural shift. If Google is forced to open its APIs by March, the \"operating leverage\" for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant re-rating as they transition from ad-networks to core utility infrastructure for Android.

      "selftext_processed": "The ongoing proceedings have confirmed that Google ’ s Play Store dominance is being challenged not_just on a monetary basis the 30 % fee but on a technical infrastructure level . The court is focused on the friction Google creates to prevent thirdparty app stores and direct installations . 1 . The Risk for Google $ GOOGL Google ’ s highmargin Services segment relies on the tollgate model . If the judge enforces the October Injunction as indicated in the Jan 22nd hearing Google loses the ability to mandate the Play Store billing system . Scare Screens Ban The court is moving toward banning the warning messages users see when sideloading apps . This removes Google ’ s primary psychological and technical barrier to competition . Google is under fire for trying to implement security fees to replace lost commissions . The judge has signaled he may reject any fees that arent based on actual marginal costs . 2 . The Opportunity for Digital Turbine $ APPS The SingleTap Patent Moat During the trial it was revealed that Epic conducted AB testing with Digital Turbine . The results showed a massive increase in conversion when using DT ’ s frictionless installation technology compared to Google ’ s standard flow . As the Gatekeeper walls fall thirdparty stores Xbox Mobile Epic Store Meta Direct Ads need a delivery mechanism . Digital Turbine ’ s SingleTap is the only patented technology currently integrated with Carriers and OEMs that can bypass the Play Store friction legally . The March 2026 Inflection Point With the judge rejecting a sweetheart deal between Google and Epic on Jan 22 the original more aggressive injunction remains the baseline . This paves the way for a massive scaling of installationsday for DT starting in H2 2026 . 3 . The Epic Games Factor Epic isnt just fighting for Fortnite they are fighting for the right to run a fullscale mobile marketplace . Their reliance on DT ’ s tech during testing proves that the Alternative Distribution market is ready for commercial scale . The market is currently pricing in uncertainty but the technical filings suggest a structural shift . If Google is forced to open its APIs by March the operating leverage for platform companies like Digital Turbine could trigger a significant rerating as they transition from adnetworks to core utility infrastructure for Android .

      "selftext": "Tesla's stock price is being floated to obscene valuations (250-300 P/E in recent months) in part by promises of robotaxis. That implies whatever Tesla is doing is going to be wildly profitable. But what evidence is there that this business model can even do that? So far Tesla's best competitor is Waymo, a subsidiary of Google, who are the number one name in autonomous taxis. The thing is, on Google's [SEC filings]( Waymo's revenue is just grouped into the \"Other Bets\" category and that came to only $344M in revenue (not profits) in Q3 2025. If being placed into the \"Other Bets\" category doesn't inspire confidence, what can? Now for comparison, Tesla's total [Q3 revenue]( was $21B, and that number needs to be meaningfully improved by future taxi revenue. So we are to believe Tesla is going to come onto the scene and in a matter of a few years do something to this industry that Waymo couldn't do in over a decade? All while having worse self driving technology and being further from approval than Waymo was several years ago? Ok.",

That implies whatever Tesla is doing is going to be wildly profitable . But what evidence is there that this business model can even do that So far Teslas best competitor is Waymo a subsidiary of Google who are the number one name in autonomous taxis . The thing is on Googles SEC filings Waymos revenue is just grouped into the Other Bets category and that came to only $ 344M in revenue not profits in Q3 2025 . If being placed into the Other Bets category doesnt inspire confidence what can Now for comparison Teslas total Q3 revenue was $ 21B and that number needs to be meaningfully improved by future taxi revenue . So we are to believe Tesla is going to come onto the scene and in a matter of a few years do something to this industry that Waymo couldnt do in over a decade All while having worse self driving technology and being further from approval than Waymo was several years ago Ok ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching gold for a while, and this move doesn’t feel like a quick spike anymore. Futures pushing through $4,900 after making repeated highs in such a short time feels more like a structural shift than a trade. What stood out to me is that banks like Goldman are saying private investors are now competing with central banks for supply, mostly through ETFs, after rate cuts kicked in. Their $5,400 target for next year is aggressive, but the logic is that this money isn’t “hot” it’s allocation-driven. Geopolitics keeps reinforcing it too. Every major headline this year Venezuela, tariffs, broader policy uncertainty gold catches a bid. UBS basically echoed the same view, calling gold a reliable hedge again, with $5k as a base case and upside if tensions stick around. With gold already up double digits YTD after last year’s run, it feels like a lot of people are treating it less like insurance and more like a core macro position. Personally, I’ve been following it more closely since getting easier TradFi access on platforms like Bitget TradFi, where tracking gold alongside other macro markets is pretty straightforward. Curious how others here are thinking about this move late stage, or still room to run?",

      "selftext": "Been doing a bit of digging on AIG lately and I’m genuinely surprised how little attention it gets relative to its fundamentals and upcoming catalysts. **1. Valuation is still cheap vs peers** AIG is still trading at a noticeable discount to peers on most metrics (P/E, P/B, and even forward EV/earnings), despite having completed a multi-year restructuring that materially de-risked the business and improved underwriting discipline. The market seems to be pricing AIG like it’s still stuck in the pre-Corebridge days, even though a big part of that drag has already been carved out. **2. The CEO turnover panic looks overdone** The latest selloff was mostly sentiment-driven around the CEO transition. But if you actually read the details, it’s not a messy exit. The succession plan was already in place, the incoming CEO has a very solid profile for the role, and the outgoing CEO isbecoming Executive Chairman. That actually reduces transition risk because the strategic direction isn’t getting ripped up overnight. The anouncement was a bit of a surprise so knee-jerk dip was expected… but the underlying business didn’t suddenly change because someone moved one seat over. **3. Earnings catalyst on deck** AIG tends to beat forecasts more often than not, and we’re heading into the next report after a period of multiple tailwinds: underwriting continues to improve pricing in commercial lines is still favorable capital returns have been strong no obvious blow-ups on the balance sheet If that pattern repeats (and historically it often has), you get the double effect of “oh, the numbers are actually fine” + “the transition isn’t a disaster.” That’s exactly the kind of setup that re-rates a stock from sentiment lows. Not saying it’s guaranteed, but structurally there is room for a sharp sentiment reversal in the next few weeks if earnings come in strong and guidance holds especially since the bear case for the dip was mostly narrative, not fundamentals. Lemme know your thoughts and prayers.",

I also bought other stocks that didn’t go up as much. Should I have just focused on the good stocks only? I know no one could’ve known the future but still.

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

      "title": "Yearly report reveals 5th largest pensionfund in the world quietly sold 10 out of its 29 billion in US Bonds",
      "selftext": "Transelated version; > The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025, just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world. This is evident from their most recent investment overview, which ABP always publishes with a three-month delay. > At the end of March, the value of US government bonds in ABP's books was still more than €29 billion. At the end of September, ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US, more than a third less. > Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US. The billions that are no longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany. During the same period, ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany. > In an interview with Fox News yesterday, Trump threatened “major retaliation” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds. With around €500 billion in pension funds, ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide. > **Multiple factors** > The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value. Rising interest rates on government bonds, for example, can depress their value. In addition, the new Dutch pension system may also play a role. Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds. > In this case, the higher interest rates are not playing a major role, according to pension experts. Shortly after Trump's announcement of import tariffs in April 2025, bond interest rates rose sharply, but that increase has been virtually wiped out. So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value, says Bas Werker, professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar. > Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP, according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON: “If you exchange US bonds for European bonds, you are not disposing of bonds.” > **Selling** > ABP's deliberate policy, i.e., selling or not repurchasing, therefore seems to play a major role. “Trump's unpredictability, and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty, are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and non-financial resilience,” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels. > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. > ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively. “That is what our investment mix is aimed at,” said the spokesperson. Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies. > **US debt** > For decades, the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world, but rising government spending is increasing the national debt. This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts. > High debt is not a problem as long as enough countries, investors, and individuals are willing to hold dollars. Trump's import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries. Since his second term as president, the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent. > Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank, the Fed, to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. This fall, the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds. > **Danish pension funds** > This week, it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds. These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights. A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trump's threat to take Greenland. > “This decision is the result of weak US public finances,” said Anders Schelde, head of investments at the Danish teachers' pension fund. According to him, it is a matter of risk management. The money is now being invested in less risky investments. > Like ABP, the Danish teachers' pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe. Nevertheless, the two cannot be viewed entirely separately: “Of course, that doesn't make it any easier to take such a decision,” said Schelde. I thought this part was interesting; > ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trump's policies. A spokesperson said that they could not comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “protect the interests of our participants.” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell, which could reduce the value of the investment. Refusing to comment as to why, sounds like they're planning to sell off more?",

      "selftext_processed": "Transelated version The civil service pension fund ABP holds significantly less US debt than it did in March 2025 just before President Trump imposed import tariffs around the world . This is evident from their most recent investment overview which ABP always publishes with a threemonth delay . At the end of March the value of US government bonds in ABPs books was still more than €29 billion . At the end of September ABP was lending only €19 billion to the US more than a third less . Experts believe that such a rapid reduction reflects a lack of confidence in the financial stability of the US . The billions that are no_longer invested in US government bonds are instead being lent to the Netherlands and Germany . During the same period ABP lent an additional €3 billion to the Netherlands and more than €6 billion to Germany . In an interview with Fox News yesterday Trump threatened “ major retaliation ” if European countries sell US stocks or bonds . With around €500 billion in pension funds ABP is the largest fund in the Netherlands and also an important institutional investor worldwide . Multiple factors The question is whether ABP is deliberately withdrawing money from America or whether the amount lent has decreased in value . Rising interest rates on government bonds for example can depress their value . In addition the new Dutch pension system may also play a role . Pension funds are now allowed to invest more riskily than before and are therefore likely to be selling off relatively safe bonds . In this case the higher interest rates are not_playing a major role according to pension experts . Shortly after Trumps announcement of import tariffs in April 2025 bond interest rates rose sharply but that increase has been virtually wiped out . So that would only explain to a very limited extent why US bonds are recorded at a much lower value says Bas Werker professor of pensions and affiliated with the pension think tank Netspar . Nor does the phasing out of bonds due to the new pension system seem to be on the agenda at ABP according to Jacintha van Bijnen of pension advisor AON “ If you exchange US bonds for European bonds you are not_disposing of bonds. ” Selling ABPs deliberate policy i.e . selling or not_repurchasing therefore seems to play a major role . “ Trumps unpredictability and in a broader sense the increasing geopolitical uncertainty are leading pension funds to take a more critical look than before at their financial and nonfinancial resilience ” says Pim Zomerdijk of investment advisor Sprenkels . ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . ABP seeks stability in order to invest and protect pension funds effectively . “ That is what our investment mix is aimed at ” said the spokesperson . Government bonds are generally considered to be a hedge against sharp fluctuations in the stock markets and currencies . US debt For decades the US has been considered the safe haven of the financial world but rising government spending is increasing the national debt . This is raising doubts about whether America is still able to repay those debts . High debt is not_a problem as long as enough countries investors and individuals are willing to hold dollars . Trumps import tariffs are putting pressure on trade with other countries . Since his second term as president the value of the dollar has fallen by more than 10 percent . Trump is also putting pressure on the central bank the Fed to lower interest rates and is threatening to dismiss Fed Chairman Jerome Powell . This fall the Dutch Central Bank also warned of the risk of financial instability and weaker US government bonds . Danish pension funds This week it was announced that two pension funds from Denmark have sold their US government bonds . These are funds in which teachers and academics accrue pension rights . A pension fund from Greenland has also said it wants to withdraw investments from the US in response to Trumps threat to take Greenland . “ This decision is the result of weak US public finances ” said Anders Schelde head of investments at the Danish teachers pension fund . According to him it is a matter of risk management . The money is now being invested in less risky investments . Like ABP the Danish teachers pension fund says that the disposal of US debt securities is not_directly linked to the rising tensions between the US and Europe . Nevertheless the two can not be viewed entirely separately “ Of course that doesnt make it any easier to take such a decision ” said Schelde . I thought this part was interesting ABP refuses to say whether US bonds have been sold off because of Trumps policies . A spokesperson said that they could not_comment on recent transactions or investment strategy in order to “ protect the interests of our participants. ” Such information could prompt competing investors to sell which could reduce the value of the investment . Refusing to comment as to why sounds like theyre planning to sell off more"

When asked to explain the difference to my dad, all I could do is cry inside and hope my mom would go exchange it for the iPod. Think about how \\*different\\* the name for the iPod even was. It's actually straight up weird. There's nothing weird about Apple anymore. They're just living off Jobs' legacy of thinking different but being cool. Their aggressive dividends is the only thing propping up the price of the stock. It definitely isn't the \"new\" iPhone \"pro\". If their product were like Coca-cola or Red Bull, who cares?

GoogleApple . Apple was an indispensable part of American life with Steve Jobs . I was gifted an MP3 player for Christmas in 07 . I asked for an iPod . When asked to explain the difference to my dad all I could do is cry inside and hope my mom would go exchange it for the iPod . Think about how different the name for the iPod even was . Its actually straight up weird . Theres nothing_weird about Apple anymore . Theyre just living off Jobs legacy of thinking different but being cool . Their aggressive dividends is the only thing propping up the price of the stock . It definitely isnt the new iPhone pro . If their product were like Cocacola or Red Bull who cares But tech is about innovating and pivoting . Not_releasing a new flavor ."

      "selftext": "It’s funny looking back at how many times people have panicked about the national debt. We freaked out at 1 trillion, then 5, then 10, 20, 30… every single milestone was supposed to be “the breaking point.” And nothing happened. Markets kept going, the dollar very volatile but always ended up OK even strong at points, the world keeps buying Treasuries. Even though headlines always said they will dump The big thing most people miss is that government debt doesn’t work like personal debt. Countries don’t pay it off like a credit card. They roll it over forever. What matters isn’t the number, it’s whether the world trusts your currency and wants your bonds. For the U.S., that answer is yes, and has been for decades. Treasuries are basically the plumbing of the entire global financial system. Banks, funds, foreign governments, the repo market, insurance companies, they all need Treasuries as collateral. If the U.S. ever stopped issuing debt, the global economy would actually fall apart. People don’t realize how central it is. And the U.S. issues debt in dollars. That alone changes the entire conversation. A country can’t “go bankrupt” on debt it owes in its own currency. The real constraint isn’t the debt number, it’s inflation and interest costs. As long as those are manageable, the size of the debt doesn’t mean much. Just a Number! Plus, every major country is in the same boat or worse. Japan is over 250 percent debt to GDP. Italy is around 140 percent. China has a massive pile of hidden local and off book debt. Nobody collapses because the modern financial world literally runs on this system. At the end of the day, the U.S. still has the reserve currency, the biggest capital markets, the most trusted debt, and the tech and military power that props the whole thing up. The debt number could be 60 trillion and people would still be buying Treasuries. So yeah, after freaking out at every milestone for 40 years, it’s pretty clear the number is mostly just a number. The structure underneath is what actually matters. Please explain what if I missed anything ??",

      "selftext": "[]( MANAGEMENT IS NOT INSANE, THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isn't *as* bad as it seems, as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year, but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year If the glasses fail and he scraps them, Snapchat saves roughly $1B a year in R&D, turns cash-flow positive, slows dilution, buys back more stock, and the market probably re-rates the company. If the glasses actually work, the upside is even bigger. Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never scrapped the project, but I believe this time is different. Looking back at 2016, this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no other tech giant had entered the arena. They rushed a product into a market that wasn’t ready, with technology that was too early for its time. The versions failed for simple reasons, including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn’t advanced enough. By 2021, while they finally had actual augmented reality, the battery life was horrible. One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $400 million/year deal with Perplexity. Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat, and this is huge for both companies. Young people love AI and they love Snapchat. It’s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity, likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year. It’s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity’s AI in its glasses. Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage. Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat+ for a small premium. This is huge, as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memory/storage features, and soon they will be charging for it. Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month. For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs, just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back. So the answer to my question is: yes, the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave, from a financial standpoint. And let’s be honest, the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal. They likely won’t save their photos to the app, but users will still use the app. One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don’t want to pay is that they’ll end up saving storage costs for the company, lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG. Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock. We completed this program in May 2025. For the nine months ended September 30, 2025, we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $500.6 million, including costs associated with the repurchases.” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2025, Snap had $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This means dilution, despite still being high, is much lower than what others are reporting. They bought back $500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025. RSUs were valued at $1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $1 billion in 2024–2025, which is by no means low, but it’s important to mention that no one mentions the buybacks. Numbers are better, everything from EPS, revenue is better then 2022, but the stock is down 50% from this time, primarily due to them burning cash (which will end once they release these glasses) and Apple's ad policy change Snapchat+ is growing steadily, making them 700 million/year A question many are asking is why Snapchat+ was released in 2022, yet the stock declined massively. This thought process is completely correct, but it’s important to look at why they’ve had massive drops during this time. Apple’s IDFA (privacy) changes, the post-pandemic tech stock drops, and the large cash burned on R&D were the main reasons for the stock dropping. However, a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money, and that they’re stepping away to other business models, which is huge. Snapchat is innovatingevery quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and non-paid subscribers. Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company, and Snapchat is not letting their app die.",

If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . Another thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge .

Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company, but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave. **Q2 2025 ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): \\~$2.87 / 3 ≈ $0.96 per user per month** Snapchat+ is $3.99 per month.

Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for. Meta’s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms, unlike Snapchat’s, which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers; it’s not just a status thing. “Stock Repurchases: In October 2024, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $500.0 million of our Class A common stock.

      "selftext_processed": "MANAGEMENT IS NOT_INSANE THEY JUST CHOSE INNOVATION DESPITE THE COSTS Dilution isnt as bad as it seems as the company has been repurchasing 500 Million a year but the reason for Stock based comp is to fund these glasses which are releasing Snapchat glasses are releasing this year IT DOSENT MATTER IF THE GLASSES FLOP IT DOES NOT_IF IT FLOPS ITS GOOD EVEN If the glasses fail he will scraps them Snapchat will save roughly $ 1B a year in RD turns cashflow positive slows dilution buys back more stock and the market probably rerates the company . If the glasses actually work the upside is even bigger . Many will point to the fact that Snap has failed four times and never_scrapped the project but I believe this time is different . Looking back at 2016 this launch was essentially a beta test at a time when no_other tech giant had entered the arena . They rushed a product into a market that wasn ’ t ready with technology that was too early for its time . The versions failed for simple reasons including that the price point was too high and the technology wasn ’ t advanced enough . By 2021 while they finally had actual augmented reality the battery life was horrible . One thing that I find really interesting is that Snapchat signed a $ 400 millionyear deal with Perplexity . Perplexity will integrate its AI with Snapchat and this is huge for both companies . Young people love AI and they love Snapchat . It ’ s likely this deal generates multiple new users for Perplexity likely causing the company to extend and likely increasing the value of the contract for next year . It ’ s also likely that Snapchat uses Perplexity ’ s AI in its glasses . One thing that I believe is a game changer is that Snapchat announced that it will be charging for storage . Users can either purchase storage monthly or upgrade to Snapchat for a small premium . This is huge as a majority of individuals in the 18–30 age range use Snapchat for its memorystorage features and soon they will be charging for it . Many people have stated that this will cause the death of the company but the question I always ask in situations where a company changes a free feature to a paid feature is whether the amount of users who end up paying for the feature will financially exceed the amount of users who leave . Q2 2025 ARPU Average Revenue Per User $ 2.87 3 ≈ $ 0.96 per user per month Snapchat is $ 3.99 per month . For every 4.15625 users that leave Snapchat due to storage costs just one has to pay for its premium service for Snapchat to make the lost revenue back . So the answer to my question is yes the number of people who end up paying will exceed the number who leave from a financial standpoint . And let ’ s be honest—the number of users leaving just because they have to pay for storage will be very minimal . They likely won ’ t save their photos to the app but users will still use the app . One thing I love about the fact that there will be users who don ’ t want to pay is that they ’ ll end up saving storage costs for the company lowering the bill they receive from AWS and CPG . Snapchat is the only company that has successfully made a paid version of its app that people actually pay for . Meta ’ s verification badge is only available to people with immense followings on their platforms unlike Snapchat ’ s which anyone can access—and people do use the features that the paid version offers it ’ s not_just a status thing . “ Stock Repurchases In October 2024 our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 500.0 million of our Class A common stock . We completed this program in May 2025 . For the nine months ended September 30 2025 we repurchased and retired 57.3 million shares of our Class A common stock for $ 500.6 million including costs associated with the repurchases. ” Repurchases under this program will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents . As of September 30 2025 Snap had $ 3.0 billion in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities . This means dilution despite still being high is much lower than what others are reporting . They bought back $ 500 million worth of stock from 2022–2025 . RSUs were valued at $ 1.3 billion in 2022–2023 and $ 1 billion in 2024–2025 which is by no_means low but it ’ s important to mention that no_one mentions the buybacks . Numbers are better everything from EPS revenue is better then 2022 but the stock is down 50 % from this time primarily due to them burning cash which will end once they release these glasses and Apples ad policy change Snapchat is growing steadily making them 700 millionyear A question many are asking is why Snapchat was released in 2022 yet the stock declined massively . This thought process is completely correct but it ’ s important to look at why they ’ ve had massive drops during this time . Apple ’ s IDFA privacy changes the postpandemic tech stock drops and the large cash burned on RD were the main reasons for the stock dropping . However a large part of my thesis is that they will be over with burning money and that they ’ re stepping away to other business models which is huge . Snapchat is innovating—every quarter recently there are new features on the app for paid and nonpaid subscribers . Innovation is the most important thing for any tech company and Snapchat is not_letting their app die ."

      "selftext": "Been investing for about 5 years now and I've noticed something weird about myself. I used to check my portfolio like 10 times a day, get stressed about red days, and try to time every little dip. My returns were mediocre. Then I realized I was basically gambling with a fundamental investing mindset, which is the worst combo. So I changed my approach. Instead of watching price action, I started tracking the stuff that actually moves markets long term. SEC filings, earnings calls, insider trades, congressional disclosures for companies I own. Sounds boring but it's genuinely changed how I think about my positions. Here's what I mean. I own some tech stocks and I used to panic when they'd drop 5% on some random Tuesday. But once I started actually reading the 10-Ks and 10-Qs, I realized most of those drops were noise. The fundamentals hadn't changed. On the flip side, I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I would've completely missed if I was just staring at charts. The problem is this takes forever. I'm a software engineer so I'm used to automating stuff, and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together what's actually happening with my holdings. That's when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have. They have teams of people doing this research. Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if we're just looking at price and volume. I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this. Tried a few different research tools and platforms. Some are clunky, some are expensive, some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight. What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources (SEC filings, exchange data, that kind of thing) and surface what's relevant to my specific holdings. Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news. Anyway, my point is this. If you're serious about fundamental investing, you need to actually know what's happening with your companies. Not the price, the actual business. And if you're like me and don't have 20 hours a week to dig through filings, you need to find a way to make that research efficient. Otherwise you're just guessing. My 1Y returns are up 29% and my 3Y average is 22%. I'm not saying that's because of this approach alone, but I'm definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them. And I sleep better at night not checking my portfolio every 5 minutes. Anyone else struggle with this? How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been investing for about 5 years now and Ive noticed something weird about myself . I used to check my portfolio like 10 times a day get stressed about red days and try to time every little dip . My returns were mediocre . Then I realized I was basically gambling with a fundamental investing mindset which is the worst combo . So I changed my approach . Instead of watching price action I started tracking the stuff that actually moves markets long term . SEC filings earnings calls insider trades congressional disclosures for companies I own . Sounds boring but its genuinely changed how I think about my positions . Heres what I mean . I own some tech stocks and I used to panic when theyd drop 5 % on some random Tuesday . But once I started actually reading the 10Ks and 10Qs I realized most of those drops were noise . The fundamentals hadnt changed . On the flip side I caught some early warning signs in other holdings by noticing patterns in insider selling that I wouldve completely missed if I was just staring at charts . The problem is this takes forever . Im a software engineer so Im used to automating stuff and I got frustrated manually digging through SEC databases and trying to piece together whats actually happening with my holdings . Thats when I realized how much of an advantage institutional investors have . They have teams of people doing this research . Retail investors like us are basically flying blind if were just looking at price and volume . I started experimenting with different ways to streamline this . Tried a few different research tools and platforms . Some are clunky some are expensive some just regurgitate news headlines without any real insight . What actually helped was finding tools that could pull data from actual sources SEC filings exchange data that kind of thing and surface whats relevant to my specific holdings . Sounds simple but most tools just show you generic market news . Anyway my point is this . If youre serious about fundamental investing you need to actually know whats happening with your companies . Not_the price the actual business . And if youre like me and dont have 20 hours a week to dig through filings you need to find a way to make that research efficient . Otherwise youre just guessing . My 1Y returns are up 29 % and my 3Y average is 22 % . Im not_saying thats because of this approach alone but Im definitely more confident in my positions now because I actually understand them . And I sleep better at night not_checking my portfolio every 5 minutes . Anyone else struggle with this How do you guys stay on top of the fundamentals without it consuming your entire life"

      "selftext": "**EDIT:** You guys rightfully tore me a mathematical asshole which I appreciate. After this post caught a little traction my 400 RKT shares magically appeared back into my account so maybe someone from RH saw this or they realized they fucked up, all is well now ________ This happened yesterday, January 21. I had 400 shares of RKT with an average price of $22.88. I was going to sell covered calls, I clicked the \"Trade\" button and saw the \"Ladder\" option which I had never seen before so wanted to check it out. This is the Ladder page on Robinhood As you can see the default setting is \"1 share\". I clicked \"Buy MKT\" to see how it worked and a popup came up saying something to the effect of 'Close and return' but I can't remember exactly what it said, I do know it said Close for sure and no buy or sell confirmation. I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $21.28 resulting in a loss of -$651.50. After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the \"Auto-send - Place orders without a confirmation\" was unchecked (it is by default) so I should've been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not. Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click \"Buy MKT\" it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order, input number of shares, set limit price, etc. I was not sent to this page yesterday. I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned. I received an email today saying the back office was not able to bust the trade. Do I have any recourse here? I'm out 400 shares and -$651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app, isn't this a FINRA violation? Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint? Support chat and email I received: Chat: E-mail:",

After this post caught a little traction my 400 RKT shares magically appeared back into my account so maybe someone from RH saw this or they realized they fucked up all is well now ________ This happened yesterday January 21 . I had 400 shares of RKT with an average price of $ 22.88 . I was going to sell covered calls I clicked the Trade button and saw the Ladder option which I had never_seen before so wanted to check it out . This is the Ladder page on Robinhood As you can see the default setting is 1 share . I clicked Buy MKT to see how it worked and a popup came up saying something to the effect of Close and return but I cant remember exactly what it said I do know it said Close for sure and no_buy or sell confirmation . I clicked it and the app immediately sold all 400 shares of my RKT stock at $ 21.28 resulting in a loss of $ 651.50 . After the trade happened I later checked the settings on the Ladder page and the Autosend Place orders without a confirmation was unchecked it is by default so I shouldve been to sent a confirmation page to confirm the order but I was not_Today I checked the Ladder page and now when you click Buy MKT it takes you to a totally separate page to confirm the order input number of shares set limit price etc . I was not_sent to this page yesterday . I spoke to RH support and was told they would talk to their back office to have the trade busted and my shares returned . I received an email today saying the back office was not_able to bust the trade . Do I have any recourse here Im out 400 shares and $ 651.50 directly caused by a bug on their app isnt this a FINRA violation Should I contact Robinhood again or file a complaint Support chat and email I received Chat Email"

Averaged down a few times and then market took a nice little dump with about 90 mins left. Don’t worry - I bought about $275k of shares that I will not touch. As much as you want to see me blow this account to 0, I will not let it happen. Also bought about $75k of some longer dated calls yesterday pre-close on some beaten down stocks (LULU, CRM, RDDT, INTC, PYPL) which all ran nicely today. I have about $350k invested. Also transferred in $50k from my other account for those of you who will be doing the math (this is now all my money). Buying power is because it includes available margin. Might yolo on some ODTE stonks tomorrow since it’s Friday.",

I told myself I could use $ 30k to yolo on OTDEs as a treat for my win . Averaged down a few times and then market took a nice little dump with about 90 mins left . Don ’ t worry I bought about $ 275k of shares that I will not_touch . As much as you want to see me blow this account to 0 I will not_let it happen . Also bought about $ 75k of some longer dated calls yesterday preclose on some beaten down stocks LULU CRM RDDT INTC PYPL which all ran nicely today . I have about $ 350k invested . Also transferred in $ 50k from my other account for those of you who will be doing the math this is now all my money . Buying power is because it includes available margin . Might yolo on some ODTE stonks tomorrow since it ’ s Friday ."

      "selftext": "As English is not my first language, I have used Gemini to help me. But you know what, see the positions first, cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99% of you guys wont read: So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold, and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on. We are talking about **Altimmune ($ALT)**. If you’ve been watching the GLP-1 space (Lilly, Novo), you know the \"fat loss\" trade is crowded. But $ALT just pivoted to the holy grail: **MASH (liver disease) + Weight Loss.** And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match. Here is the DD. # 1. The Data is absolute fire (FDA Agrees) The market punished this thing last year because they wanted \"just another weight loss drug.\" $ALT gave them something better: **Pemvidutide.** * **BTD CONFIRMED:** As of Jan 5, 2026, the FDA granted them **Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD)** for MASH. This is huge. It means the FDA sees \"substantial improvement\" over existing therapies. This is also means chances of approval are now over 75%, FDA wants this drug **LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS - BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL, only around 1/3 of applications gets accepted, and it tells big Pharma, FDA wants this drug, come fucking buy** * **The Kicker:** Unlike Madrigal’s drug (Rezdiffra) which just treats the liver, $ALT’s drug shreds fat too. Patients hit **7.5% weight loss at 48 weeks** on the high dose, and the chart showed *no plateau* (meaning they were still losing weight). It’s a two-for-one special: Fix the liver, lose the gut. # 2. The \"For Sale\" Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part. Look at the C-Suite changes. They aren't building a 20-year dynasty; they are dressing the bride for a wedding. * **New CEO (Jan 2026):** Jerry Durso. Who is he? He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals. **He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma.** He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout. * **New CFO (Nov 2024):** Greg Weaver. This guy was the CFO at Sirna (sold to Merck) and ILEX (sold to Genzyme). * **Translation:** You don't hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade. # 3. Valuation is a Joke (The Value Play) Let’s look at the comps. This is why it’s the best value on the board. * **Madrigal ($MDGL):** Multi-Billion market cap. (Commercial stage, but expensive). * **Viking ($VKTX):** \\~$8B+ market cap. * Novo also got some company in this space for billions * **Altimmune ($ALT):** **\\~$450M - $550M Market Cap.** It is trading at cash + a handshake. If this gets even *half* the valuation of its peers, it’s a multi-bagger. The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA. The ship is loaded. # 4. The Catalyst & The Risk * **The Hype:** The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 2026). Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring. * **The Risk (The Bear Case):** Cash. They have \\~$210M (as of late 2025). Phase 3 is expensive. * *Scenario A:* They dilute. Stock dips, we cry, then it recovers. * *Scenario B:* Partnership (Non-dilutive cash). Stock moons. * *Scenario C:* Buyout. We retire. # Summary They have the **Data** (BTD granted), they have the **Management** (literally hired guys who sell companies), and they have the **Market Cap** (insanely low compared to peers). This isn't a pure obesity play anymore; it's the leading **MASH play** that makes you skinny. **TL;DR:** * **Ticker:** $ALT * **Catalyst:** FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation + Phase 3 start. * **Upside:** 3-5x to catch up to peer valuations. * **Risk:** Cash burn/Dilution (unless they partner/sell first). * **Prediction:** Jerry Durso didn't take this job to work a 9-5. He took it to sign a deal. bonus - 21% SI Not financial advice, but this could 2x to 10x , who the hell knows, but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason.... Many people saying AI bots. Check my history, I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard. Now who comments on the threads, I can't control. Bonus - weight loss means bigger peepee Edit - if you guys made money take your profits. It's run harder than I thought, still keep skin in the game.",

      "selftext_processed": "As English is not_my first language I have used Gemini to help me . But you know what see the positions first cause that is all you degens care about and now the part which 99 % of you guys wont read So I have been digging through the biotech trash heap looking for gold and I think I found the only ticker that Mr. Market is completely sleeping on . We are talking about Altimmune $ ALT . If you ’ ve been watching the GLP1 space Lilly Novo you know the fat loss trade is crowded . But $ ALT just pivoted to the holy grail MASH liver disease Weight Loss . And the setup right now is looking like a powder keg waiting for a match . Here is the DD . 1 . The Data is absolute fire FDA Agrees The market punished this thing last year because they wanted just another weight loss drug . $ ALT gave them something better Pemvidutide . BTD CONFIRMED As of Jan 5 2026 the FDA granted them Breakthrough Therapy Designation BTD for MASH . This is huge . It means the FDA sees substantial improvement over existing therapies . This is also means chances of approval are now over 75 % FDA wants this drug LET ME SAY THIS IN CAPS BTD IS A HUGE FUCKING DEAL only around 13 of applications gets accepted and it tells big Pharma FDA wants this drug come fucking buy The Kicker Unlike Madrigal ’ s drug Rezdiffra which just treats the liver $ ALT ’ s drug shreds fat too . Patients hit 7.5 % weight loss at 48 weeks on the high dose and the chart showed no plateau meaning they were still losing weight . It ’ s a twoforone special Fix the liver lose the gut . 2 . The For Sale Sign is Blinking This is the most bullish part . Look at the CSuite changes . They arent building a 20year dynasty they are dressing the bride for a wedding . New CEO Jan 2026 Jerry Durso . Who is he He was the CEO of Intercept Pharmaceuticals . He literally just sold Intercept to Alfasigma . He knows exactly how to package a liver drug for a buyout . New CFO Nov 2024 Greg Weaver . This guy was the CFO at Sirna sold to Merck and ILEX sold to Genzyme . Translation You dont hire a liquidation squad if you plan to run independent trials for the next decade . 3 . Valuation is a Joke The Value Play Let ’ s look at the comps . This is why it ’ s the best value on the board . Madrigal $ MDGL MultiBillion market cap . Commercial stage but expensive . Viking $ VKTX $ 8B market cap . Novo also got some company in this space for billions Altimmune $ ALT $ 450M $ 550M Market Cap . It is trading at cash a handshake . If this gets even half the valuation of its peers it ’ s a multibagger . The Phase 3 setup is fully aligned with the FDA . The ship is loaded . 4 . The Catalyst The Risk The Hype The stock started heating up at the JPM Healthcare Conference Jan 2026 . Big Pharma is swimming in cash and looking for MASH assets because their patents are expiring . The Risk The Bear Case Cash . They have $ 210M as of late 2025 . Phase 3 is expensive . Scenario A They dilute . Stock dips we cry then it recovers . Scenario B Partnership Nondilutive cash . Stock moons . Scenario C Buyout . We retire . Summary They have the Data BTD granted they have the Management literally hired guys who sell companies and they have the Market Cap insanely low compared to peers . This isnt a pure obesity play anymore its the leading MASH play that makes you skinny . TLDR Ticker $ ALT Catalyst FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation Phase 3 start . Upside 35x to catch up to peer valuations . Risk Cash burnDilution unless they partnersell first . Prediction Jerry Durso didnt take this job to work a 95 . He took it to sign a deal . bonus 21 % SI Not_financial advice but this could 2x to 10x who the hell knows but is should fly baby fly It ran 20 percent today for a reason .... Many people saying AI bots . Check my history I am as degen and idiotic as any other regard . Now who comments on the threads I cant control . Bonus weight loss means bigger peepee Edit if you guys made money take your profits . Its run harder than I thought still keep skin in the game ."

EPS for last quarter came in at $.15, significantly topping estiates of $.08. Revenue of $13.67 billion topped estimates of about $13.4 billion. The results for last quarter look solid. The problem is Q1 guidance, which is $11.7 billion to $12.7 billion. At the midpoint that’s below Wall Street’s estimate of $12.51 billion. Q1 EPS guidance is also poor.

      "selftext": "After conducting several rounds of expert calls with the meteorological expert panel known as chatgpt, claude & gemini, as well as analyzing the latest weather models from anime pfp's on twitter, I have arrived at the conclusion that America's energy infrastructure is about to be hit by the Mother Of All Snow Storms (MOASS). As a great American once said, never let a good crisis go to waste. To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity, I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the \"massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze. **Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record**, more than three times its previous best quarter\". [ $ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021, thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis. Just look at their CEO, I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals. I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend, hence the yolo. Disclosures: I am not a financial professional, my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research, and should not be the basis for anyone else's decisions.",

As a great American once said never_let a good crisis go to waste . To figure out how to capitalize on this opportunity I looked to the work of this highly helpful Texas Consumer Association NGO that explains the massive windfall key industry players made during the freeze . Energy Transfer posted its highest quarterly net income on record more than three times its previous best quarter . $ ET made a killing off Winter Storm Uri in 2021 thanks to a massive energy storage and logistics network of assets that was primed to capitalize on market dislocations from the crisis . Just look at their CEO I am sure glad to be on his side of the table on these energy deals . I am betting on a repeat of the 2021 bonanza over this weekend hence the yolo . Disclosures I am not_a financial professional my own findings and financial decisions were made based on AI slop and trust me bro twitter research and should not_be the basis for anyone elses decisions ."

But some of these ETFs claim to have \"the top 100 global companies\", but then something like Exxon Mobil will be in the top 10, when it's really more like #20, so it's deceiving or at least not immediately clear what they are using to rank the weights of their holdings. I know I can just look up like Morningstar or Fidelity reports on their holdings, but is there like some website or tool I can use to just type how many shares I have of each stock and ETF, and then it pulls the current prices and % holdings of the ETFs to calculate what the percentage makeup of your portfolio is? I just want to better understand what's in my portfolio and what's not at a glance. I can't find anything that does this.",

I know I can just look up like Morningstar or Fidelity reports on their holdings but is there like some website or tool I can use to just type how many shares I have of each stock and ETF and then it pulls the current prices and % holdings of the ETFs to calculate what the percentage makeup of your portfolio is I just want to better understand whats in my portfolio and whats not_at a glance .

I’m currently low on cash in my bank account to finish paying the rest of it off. I have a RH brokerage account that holds \\~20% VOO and the rest of it is individual stocks (TSM, WMT, RKLB, etc). I use this account to hold onto stocks long term. If I sell all of my VOO, I will have enough money to pay off the rest of the ring. I plan on getting back into S&P 500 exposure either through my job’s 401K plan or a Roth IRA. Or would it be better to hold VOO and sell some of the individual stocks I own? Please let me know what you guys think. Thank you! Edit: Want to clarify here since a lot of people are asking: the engagement ring is a lab grown diamond ring, only need $2,000 to pay off the rest of it, which is about how much I have in VOO.

      "selftext": "As of writing this post gold is \\~$4900/oz and platinum is \\~$2550/oz. Platinum is estimated to be 30x rarer than gold, why is it 1/2 the cost? Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years. It has constant demand from central banks and will always be seen as the go to as a safe haven. There will always be a premium for it but 200% relative to platinum, a scarcer mineral, seems excessive. Silver I think is more comparable to platinum, it isn’t viewed in the same light as gold and doesn’t deserve the premium gold has. Yet silver has surged more than platinum, why? Perhaps it’s due to it being a cheaper alternative to gold but for every 1 oz of platinum mined there are 139 oz of silver mined. Based solely on that, silver is \\~$96, making platinum 26x more expensive. It surely has room to grow higher based only on scarcity. Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters. This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years. Solely on this, the supply constraints will push up prices. There’s also growth as it’s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs. The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it’s also used in manufacturing for various defence products. I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not even being met.

Platinum is primarily used in the automotive industry for catalytic converters . This provides a baseline demand and the market has seen a significant supply deficit for the past few years . Solely on this the supply constraints will push up prices . There ’ s also growth as it ’ s used in hydrogen fuel cells as AI demands an increase in power outputs . The world spending on defence is also projected to increase due to Trump and it ’ s also used in manufacturing for various defence products . I see an opportunity for price increases due to scarcity and use case growth with limited downside due to baseline demand not_even being met .

      "selftext": "Cavvy Energy (CVVY.TO), a Canadian energy company, has been locked in a awful contract for years. This deal required 80% of their sulphur production to be sold at $6/mt. Compare that to the current market value of $260/mt, and you can see how awful this deal is. This has meant Cavvy received an average of $34/mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $260/mt they could've gotten. This changes this year. In November, they entered into a new contract, wherein 1/3 of their suplhur will be sold at $225/mt, 1/3 between $205-$250/mt, and 1/3 at full market value. Averaged out, this'd put the price they get at around $250/mt, or 7.3x what they got last quarter. Cavvy currently produces around 1,100 mt/d, but can expand that to 1,400 mt/d at peak periods. Averaged at 1200 mt/d, it means Cavvy currently receives around $14M a year from sulphur, but with the new deal would be getting around $100M a year (perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer, which the current $34/mt accounts for). Last year, Cavvy made around $30M a quarter in total NOI, across all areas of their business: already a significant increase from the year before. Accounting for the new suplhur pricing, they could be adding $20M per quarter to that number, or around +60% compared to last year, or a total $200M NOI compared to $120M (although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy, so it may not be indicative). They've been working down their debt every quarter, to currently $160M. The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster. Their net income per quarter often brushes break-even, or dips into the negatives somewhat, but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0. It seems like they'll break even for last year, which again, should put them in the green this year. At C$260M cap at the moment, it wouldn't take much profit to make them undervalued. The stock's already up 200% in the past year, and I think it could go higher. I will note that what values are in USD$ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry. The suplhur market price is in USD, but the market cap in C$, so numbers may vary a little.",

      "selftext_processed": "Cavvy Energy CVVY.TO a Canadian energy company has been locked in a awful contract for years . This deal required 80 % of their sulphur production to be sold at $ 6mt . Compare that to the current market value of $ 260mt and you can see how awful this deal is . This has meant Cavvy received an average of $ 34mt for their sulphur last quarter against the $ 260mt they couldve gotten . This changes this year . In November they entered into a new contract wherein 13 of their suplhur will be sold at $ 225mt 13 between $ 205 $ 250mt and 13 at full market value . Averaged out thisd put the price they get at around $ 250mt or 7.3x what they got last quarter . Cavvy currently produces around 1100 mtd but can expand that to 1400 mtd at peak periods . Averaged at 1200 mtd it means Cavvy currently receives around $ 14M a year from sulphur but with the new deal would be getting around $ 100M a year perhaps slightly less when factoring in costs of sulphur storage and transfer which the current $ 34mt accounts for . Last year Cavvy made around $ 30M a quarter in total NOI across all areas of their business already a significant increase from the year before . Accounting for the new suplhur pricing they could be adding $ 20M per quarter to that number or around 60 % compared to last year or a total $ 200M NOI compared to $ 120M although yearly figures seem to shift quite a lot for Cavvy so it may not_be indicative . Theyve been working down their debt every quarter to currently $ 160M . The large uptick in revenue would certainly help clear that faster . Their net income per quarter often brushes breakeven or dips into the negatives somewhat but this revenue increase should put them comfortably above 0 . It seems like theyll break even for last year which again should put them in the green this year . At C $ 260M cap at the moment it wouldnt take much profit to make them undervalued . The stocks already up 200 % in the past year and I think it could go higher . I will note that what values are in USD $ or Canadian $ is a bit blurry . The suplhur market price is in USD but the market cap in C $ so numbers may vary a little ."

Might put down 10k in buys and 10k in sells just to cover for a major move up and down. Good luck to all regards who are playing earnings call and I hope I find another setup like this soon.

      "selftext": "# The Monetization of Inertia: Why Davos 2026 wasn't a capitulation, but a signal that Microsoft is winning by servicing corporate inefficiency rather than fixing it. Davos 2026 take: Microsoft isn't \"slowing down.\" They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS. Everyone is talking about how \"depressing\" or \"pragmatic\" Nadella sounded at Davos this year. The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supply-side issues or just slowing down. I think that's a total misread. I’ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations (Salesforce, Workday, Asana) vs Microsoft’s positioning, and honestly, MSFT isn't winning because their AI is \"smarter.\" They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change. Here is what I’m seeing: **1. The \"Middle-Management Firewall\"** We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies. But in the real world (logistics, law, old-school manufacturing), the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it. Instead of fixing the data, companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess. It’s not a revolution; it’s a patch. Microsoft realized they don't need to fix the enterprise; they just need to tax its inefficiency. **2. SaaS is bleeding out** The whole \"seat-based\" pricing model is dying. You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work. But if AI agents start doing the work, you don't need the GUI. You need the API and the data. Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer (Graph/Office). The \"middleman\" apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat. That’s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds. **3. Legacy is the Moat** This is the most contrarian part: The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure (VBA macros, old ERPs, unstructured PDFs) is actually a defense mechanism. Agile AI startups can't integrate with this garbage. Microsoft can, because they built half of it. They are effectively selling \"safety\" to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack. **My take:** This isn't a tech stagnation. It's a shift from a war of maneuver (startups breaking things) to a war of attrition. Microsoft is digging in. The \"inertia\" of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now, and Nadella is the only one servicing it. Thoughts? Is legacy debt a long-term moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything? *I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric. Wondering if this \"inertia as defense\" is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our high-tech stagnation.*",

      "selftext_processed": "The Monetization of Inertia Why Davos 2026 wasnt a capitulation but a signal that Microsoft is winning by servicing corporate inefficiency rather than fixing it . Davos 2026 take Microsoft isnt slowing down . They are winning by letting corporate inertia kill SaaS . Everyone is talking about how depressing or pragmatic Nadella sounded at Davos this year . The narrative seems to be that the AI revolution is hitting a wall of supplyside issues or just slowing down . I think thats a total misread . I ’ ve been looking at the drop in SaaS valuations Salesforce Workday Asana vs Microsoft ’ s positioning and honestly MSFT isnt winning because their AI is smarter . They are winning because they are monetizing the fact that huge companies are too dysfunctional to change . Here is what I ’ m seeing 1 . The MiddleManagement Firewall We all thought AI would come in and optimize inefficiencies . But in the real world logistics law oldschool manufacturing the data is such a mess that AI models just choke on it . Instead of fixing the data companies are just buying Copilot to layer on top of the mess . It ’ s not_a revolution it ’ s a patch . Microsoft realized they dont need to fix the enterprise they just need to tax its inefficiency . 2 . SaaS is bleeding out The whole seatbased pricing model is dying . You used to pay for Asana or Salesforce so humans could click buttons to manage work . But if AI agents start doing the work you dont need the GUI . You need the API and the data . Microsoft owns the OS and the data layer GraphOffice . The middleman apps that just manage complexity are losing their moat . That ’ s why their stocks are tanking while MSFT holds . 3 . Legacy is the Moat This is the most contrarian part The sheer ugliness of legacy infrastructure VBA macros old ERPs unstructured PDFs is actually a defense mechanism . Agile AI startups cant integrate with this garbage . Microsoft can because they built half of it . They are effectively selling safety to dinosaurs who are too scared to rebuild their stack . My take This isnt a tech stagnation . Its a shift from a war of maneuver startups breaking things to a war of attrition . Microsoft is digging in . The inertia of the Global 2000 companies is the biggest asset class in the world right now and Nadella is the only one servicing it . Thoughts Is legacy debt a longterm moat or just a temporary speed bump before agents eat everything I wrote this because I believe we are missing the structural shift while focusing on rhetoric . Wondering if this inertia as defense is a temporary speedbump or the permanent state of our hightech stagnation ."

But I don’t know where should I learn, and how can I use my technical analysis in stocks for my own good. Someone here was in a similar situation like me or maybe know where can I learn stocks analysis that fit to my abilities? I would love to hear advices.",

      "selftext": "Equities moved slightly higher yesterday, but it didn’t feel like a “relief rally” driven by resolved headlines. If anything, markets seem to be pricing *less immediate downside*, not new certainty. There has been a lot of noise around geopolitics, trade rhetoric, and election-related risk, but no concrete policy shifts or confirmed deals that materially change the macro outlook. Tariff risks for Europe haven’t been removed, and broader trade uncertainty is still very much on the table. What likely supported stocks was positioning and rates. Bond yields stayed contained, volatility remained muted, and there was no catalyst forcing risk-off behavior. In that environment, even modest dip-buying can push indices higher. To me this looks more like patience than confidence. Markets aren’t panicking, but they’re also not celebrating. Until we see real policy clarity or stronger macro data, this feels like a range-bound grind where headline risk remains asymmetric. Interested how others read it. Is this just positioning ahead of upcoming data, or do you see genuine upside conviction building here?",

      "title": "$ATEX A Play on Exclusive Rights to Smart Grid Radiocommunications Wavelength & Modernisation Needs",
      "selftext": "I'll preface this by saying, this is a play on increases in mass energy needs, the need for grid modernisation as a result, and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate. Anterix (ATEX) is a deep-value play on Smart Grids' needs for critical radio frequency communication. \\*\\***As of writing, ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band, a specialised frequency critical for the multi-trillion dollar US grid modernisation**.\\*\\* The current market cap sits at approximately $473 million, with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $3B across 60+ potential utility customers. Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability, with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $100 million from the previous $80 million guidance. On a business metrics and stock mathematics level, there is a significant valuation gap and a debt-free balance sheet. ATEX currently trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 4.9x, a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of \\~16x. This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company’s $250 million authorised share repurchase program, which remains active through to September 2026. \\***As of the most recent filings, over $227 million remains on this authorisation - a figure representing nearly 48% of the company's total market capitalisation**.\\* This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy, it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count, effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies per-share value as revenue from long-term utility contracts scales. From a technical and operational standpoint, the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic de-risking. The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase, evidenced by the $147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments. The stock chart reflects this momentum; after bottoming in late 2025 near $18, ATEX has established a strong ascending channel, with current technical support firming up around $23.50 - $24.00. With $39 million in cash and zero debt, Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to re-rate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $50 - $55, which aligns with conservative spectrum-valuation methodologies of \\~$0.40/MHz-pop. \\*\\*Wireless Company Valuation\\*\\* *Conservative* If one applies a conservative $0.40/MHz pop math to Anterix’s nationwide footprint: 2.0 Billion MHz-pops x $0.40 = $800 Million (Spectrum Value) Add: \\~$40M Cash + \\~$140M in Contracted Receivables. Subtract: liabilities/burn. Divide by: \\~18-19 million shares. This calculation results in a price per share in the $50 range *Bull* At (already in contract with SDG&E) $2/MHz pop, this valuation quickly shifts to $200-250/ps Entry: $23-26 Target: $65 LFG 🍀🥸",

      "selftext_processed": "Ill preface this by saying this is a play on increases in mass energy needs the need for grid modernisation as a result and the underlying processes that allow Smart Grids to operate . Anterix ATEX is a deepvalue play on Smart Grids needs for critical radio frequency communication . As of writing ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band a specialised frequency critical for the multitrillion dollar US grid modernisation . The current market cap sits at approximately $ 473 million with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $ 3B across 60 potential utility customers . Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $ 2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $ 100 million from the previous $ 80 million guidance . On a business metrics and stock mathematics level there is a significant valuation gap and a debtfree balance sheet . ATEX currently trades at a trailing PE ratio of 4.9x a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of 16x . This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company ’ s $ 250 million authorised share repurchase program which remains active through to September 2026 . As of the most recent filings over $ 227 million remains on this authorisation a figure representing nearly 48 % of the companys total market capitalisation . This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies pershare value as revenue from longterm utility contracts scales . From a technical and operational standpoint the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic derisking . The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase evidenced by the $ 147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments . The stock chart reflects this momentum after bottoming in late 2025 near $ 18 ATEX has established a strong ascending channel with current technical support firming up around $ 23.50 $ 24.00 . With $ 39 million in cash and zero debt Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to rerate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $ 50 $ 55 which aligns with conservative spectrumvaluation methodologies of $ 0.40MHzpop . Wireless Company Valuation Conservative If one applies a conservative $ 0.40MHz pop math to Anterix ’ s nationwide footprint 2.0 Billion MHzpops x $ 0.40 $ 800 Million Spectrum Value Add $ 40M Cash $ 140M in Contracted Receivables . Subtract liabilitiesburn . Divide by 1819 million shares . This calculation results in a price per share in the $ 50 range Bull At already in contract with SDGE $ 2MHz pop this valuation quickly shifts to $ 200250ps Entry $ 2326 Target $ 65 LFG 🍀🥸"

Notably, this rally wasn't a market-wide one. It was driven by major AI and robotics companies, including Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Hyundai Motor Company. This is interpreted as a concentrated rally driven by increased global AI investment and momentum in the semiconductor market, rather than a general market uptrend. I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

Various customers thought this move was outside their longterm contract agreements for deliveries which obviously was not_the case and VG is winning the arbitration cases Stock is up well over 10 % and after hours trading and Likely will move higher Great investment opportunity moving forward because there ’ s a lot of move to run in .

      "selftext": "(I’m long on Nvidia and a dozen other major AI related stocks. I’m also in various S&P positions and funds. Just a disclaimer.) Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China, a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world’s second largest economy. A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for arms-sale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports. The text, endorsed by the panel’s Republicans and Democrats, would outright ban sales of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China for two years, codifying existing export controls into law. The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China, a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress. Trump’s approval for Nvidia’s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department. The panel approved the bill by a 42-2 margin. It now heads to the House for a floor vote. The Senate has yet to release a companion version, but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales. Under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they’re approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries through a joint resolution. The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the end-users buying them. It also creates a way for so-called “trusted” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries, an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries, and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race. Spokespeople for Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world ’ s second largest economy . A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for armssale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports . The text endorsed by the panel ’ s Republicans and Democrats would outright ban sales of Nvidia ’ s Blackwell chips to China for two years codifying existing export controls into law . The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump ’ s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress . Trump ’ s approval for Nvidia ’ s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department . The panel approved the bill by a 422 margin . It now heads to the House for a floor vote . The Senate has yet to release a companion version but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales . Under the legislation the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they ’ re approved giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China Russia Iran and other adversaries through a joint resolution . The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the endusers buying them . It also creates a way for socalled “ trusted ” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race . Spokespeople for Nvidia didn ’ t immediately respond to a request for comment ."

He said: \"This solution, if consummated, will be a great one for the United States of America, and all Nato Nations. \"Based upon this understanding, I will not be imposing the Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on February 1st. Additional discussions are being held concerning The Golden Dome as it pertains to Greenland. \"Further information will be made available as discussions progress. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, and various others, as needed, will be responsible for the negotiations - They will report directly to me.

      "selftext": "Hey guys, so I am trying to figure out the proper way to do a stock and bond balance. I am currently 24 and have a ROTH IRA that is at 15k and fully invested in VT. I am planning on adding bonds when I get to 40 or so. At 40 I am thinking to get to 10% bonds, then increase by 1% each ear until I am at 30% at 60. I know that is is best to have bonds in a traditional IRA and keep the ROTH 100% VT. The problem I've been thinking about is when I'm 40, lets say the ROTH is at 100k or something with me contributing the max each year. If I just start the bonds at that point in a traditional IRA, how could I get the traditional to 10K? I know you cannot transfer funds from a ROTH to traditional, and the contribution limit is around 7k shared between both of them. I was thinking maybe if I get a 401k(which I dont currently have) I could transfer that to a traditional with funds already in there. It would be nice to just immediately transfer 10% of the funds from VT to bonds, but this doesn't seem possible between a ROTH and traditional. This all seems like a headache. What is the best way to go about the bond and stock balance?",

      "selftext": "**The 30-year backstory** Japan's economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble. To restore the economy, Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere: slash interest rates to zero, then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds. This creates artificial demand that pushes yields (aka borrowing costs) even lower. It's a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket. And being able to print money to pay it back. It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world. 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact. That's quadrillion with a Q. It also opened up an obvious trade. If you can borrow money for free, and put it in something yielding 4, 5, 6%... you've found an infinite money glitch. Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills. This made them the largest holder of US treasuries, with $1.2 trillion. The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up. This worked great for thirty years until COVID. Governments were forced to print money en masse, and inflation finally arrived. Japan's playbook worked when inflation was dead. But when it finally came back and prices started rising, printing money would make it worse. So Japan has had to stop printing money, and raise rates. **The $1.2 trillion dollar question** So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up? Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4% for the first time in decades. For thirty years, Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield. Now they can get it at home. That $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo. All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere. For thirty years, it went into Treasuries, tech stocks, everything. Now imagine it leaving. And that has markets on edge. **What's next?** I don't know how this shakes out. But when Ray Dalio talks about a \"changing world order,\" this is probably part of it. One of the global market's laws of nature, endless cheap Japanese money, is coming to an end. **Note:** I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation. By no means an expert, so let me know if I missed anything obvious.",

      "selftext_processed": "The 30year backstory Japans economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble . To restore the economy Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere slash interest rates to zero then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds . This creates artificial demand that pushes yields aka borrowing costs even lower . Its a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket . And being able to print money to pay it back . It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world . 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact . Thats quadrillion with a Q . It also opened up an obvious trade . If you can borrow money for free and put it in something yielding 4 5 6 % ... youve found an infinite money glitch . Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills . This made them the largest holder of US treasuries with $ 1.2 trillion . The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up . This worked great for thirty years until COVID . Governments were forced to print money en masse and inflation finally arrived . Japans playbook worked when inflation was dead . But when it finally came back and prices started rising printing money would make it worse . So Japan has had to stop printing money and raise rates . The $ 1.2 trillion dollar question So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4 % for the first time in decades . For thirty years Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield . Now they can get it at home . That $ 1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo . All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere . For thirty years it went into Treasuries tech stocks everything . Now imagine it leaving . And that has markets on edge . Whats next I dont know how this shakes out . But when Ray Dalio talks about a changing world order this is probably part of it . One of the global markets laws of nature endless cheap Japanese money is coming to an end . Note I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation . By no_means an expert so let me know if I missed anything obvious ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ ]( >The European Union's legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump. >\"Given the continued and escalating threats, including tariff threats, against Greenland and Denmark, and their European allies, we have been left with no alternative but to suspend work\" on the deal, said Bernd Lange, the chairman of the European Parliament's international trade committee. >\"Until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation,\" no steps to move the deal forward would be taken, Lange said in a statement. >\"Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake,\" he added in a post on X. \"Business as usual impossible.\" >The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries, plus the U.K., with tariffs if they did not allow the United States to control Greenland. >The E.U. trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. >The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U. at just 15%. The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year. >Some imports from the E.U., such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed. >In exchange for the lower tariff rate, the European Union, America's largest trading partner, would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States. This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27-country bloc. >The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U. was worth $1.5 trillion in goods and services annually, as of 2024. The U.S. imports more than $600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average, while Europeans buy more than $360 billion of U.S. goods, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative. >When the so-called \"Turnberry deal\" was first announced, the European Commission hailed its potential, saying it \"restores stability and predictability.\" >But all that changed with Trump's Saturday tariff threat. >\"In politics as in business, a deal is a deal\" Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"When friends shake hands, it must mean something.\" >During his own Davos speech, Trump said that the U.S. would not use force to seize Greenland. But he did not take his threat of a 10% tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table. >Lange, the E.U. trade official, held a press conference following Trump's speech and called the president's assurances about force in Greenland \"a small positive element.\" >Nonetheless, \"It's totally clear that with this 10%-25% \\[tariffs\\] pressure, he is really getting into a new quality of relation,\" said Lange. >As long as Trump's tariff threat remains in place, \"There will be no possibility for compromise\" Lange said. >On Thursday, leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trump's Greenland threats. >This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $110 billion, which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports, from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon. >Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the bloc's \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.'s trade \"bazooka.\" >The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers. >These could include investment restrictions, the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies, the suspension of business licenses, and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone. >Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U. a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion, the trade bazooka has never been deployed before. >On Wednesday, Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The European Unions legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump . Given the continued and escalating threats including tariff threats against Greenland and Denmark and their European allies we have been left with no_alternative but to suspend work on the deal said Bernd Lange the chairman of the European Parliaments international trade committee . Until the US decides to reengage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation no_steps to move the deal forward would be taken Lange said in a statement . Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake he added in a post on X . Business as usual impossible . The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries plus the U.K. with tariffs if they did not_allow the United States to control Greenland . The E.U . trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trumps golf club in Turnberry Scotland . The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U . at just 15 % . The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year . Some imports from the E.U . such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed . In exchange for the lower tariff rate the European Union Americas largest trading partner would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States . This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27country bloc . The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U . was worth $ 1.5 trillion in goods and services annually as of 2024 . The U.S. imports more than $ 600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average while Europeans buy more than $ 360 billion of U.S. goods according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative . When the socalled Turnberry deal was first announced the European Commission hailed its potential saying it restores stability and predictability . But all that changed with Trumps Saturday tariff threat . In politics as in business a deal is a deal Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland . When friends shake hands it must mean something . During his own Davos speech Trump said that the U.S. would not_use force to seize Greenland . But he did not_take his threat of a 10 % tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table . Lange the E.U . trade official held a press conference following Trumps speech and called the presidents assurances about force in Greenland a small positive element . Nonetheless Its totally clear that with this 10 % 25 % tariffs pressure he is really getting into a new quality of relation said Lange . As long as Trumps tariff threat remains in place There will be no_possibility for compromise Lange said . On Thursday leaders of the 27 E.U . countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trumps Greenland threats . This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $ 110 billion which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon . Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the blocs AntiCoercion Instrument a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.s trade bazooka . The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers . These could include investment restrictions the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies the suspension of business licenses and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone . Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U . a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion the trade bazooka has never_been deployed before . On Wednesday Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use ."

      "selftext": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999. Bulls say Nvidia is different. Bears say it's the dot-com bubble all over again. I own 190 shares and here's my honest assessment. First, the bull case. Nvidia's real moat isn't just GPUs. It's CUDA. 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020. That's an ecosystem Cisco never had. Cisco laid 'dark fiber', infrastructure nobody used. Nvidia's GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue. There are already 10 AI products over $1B ARR, 50 over $100M. Enterprise AI spending is $37B in 2025, up from $11.5B in 2024. That's 3x growth. The demand is real, not hypothetical as it was for Cisco. But the bear case is legitimate. At 50x P/E, Nvidia is priced for perfection. If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges, the stock has a long way to fall. Google's TPU, Amazon's Trainium, Microsoft's Maia - all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence. If any succeed at scale, Nvidia's moat gets tested (although these are arguably a long way off). The wildcard is export controls. As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank, I see something most overlook - the US govt plans to take 25% of Nvidia's China chip sales. They've literally crowned Nvidia as the winner. This creates a regulatory moat. The government has skin in the game. But it's also a risk because China has to play along (which they soon likely will) and policy could change overnight. But here's the valuation reality - Nvidia needs \\~$198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices. In my newsletter, I break down various scenarios: Bull case (25%): doubles from here. Base case (50%): down \\~15%. Bear case (25%): down \\~65%.",

      "selftext_processed": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999 . Bulls say Nvidia is different . Bears say its the dotcom bubble all over again . I own 190 shares and heres my honest assessment . First the bull case . Nvidias real moat isnt just GPUs . Its CUDA . 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020 . Thats an ecosystem Cisco never_had . Cisco laid dark fiber infrastructure nobody_used . Nvidias GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue . There are already 10 AI products over $ 1B ARR 50 over $ 100M . Enterprise AI spending is $ 37B in 2025 up from $ 11.5B in 2024 . Thats 3x growth . The demand is real not_hypothetical as it was for Cisco . But the bear case is legitimate . At 50x PE Nvidia is priced for perfection . If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges the stock has a long way to fall . Googles TPU Amazons Trainium Microsofts Maia all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence . If any succeed at scale Nvidias moat gets tested although these are arguably a long way off . The wildcard is export controls . As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank I see something most overlook the US govt plans to take 25 % of Nvidias China chip sales . Theyve literally crowned Nvidia as the winner . This creates a regulatory moat . The government has skin in the game . But its also a risk because China has to play along which they soon likely will and policy could change overnight . But heres the valuation reality Nvidia needs $ 198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices . In my newsletter I break down various scenarios Bull case 25 % doubles from here . Base case 50 % down 15 % . Bear case 25 % down 65 % ."

      "selftext": "Many of you know this but in the last century, money changed three times: 1. 1933-1934 During the Great Depression, the US government banned the ownership of gold. Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $20.67 per ounce. Shortly after people turned in their gold, the US government revalued gold at 35$ per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar overnight. 2. 1944-1971 After World War II, a new system was created: the Bretton Woods system. The US dollar became the world's reserve currency, convertible to gold at $35 per ounce for foreign governments & central banks. Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars, while gold was stored in US government vaults. This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves. 3. 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely. Money was backed by trust, institutions and policy. Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods, the Federal Reserve’s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility. After Bretton Woods ended in 1971, those constraints disappeared, giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve (8 metric tons of gold) was accumulated before 1971, first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold. The same \\~8,000 tons of US gold were valued at \\~$5B in 1933, \\~$9B after the 1934 revaluation, and would be worth over $1.25T today at market prices. This lead to assets going up in value drastically. \\- Today gold is valued at $4,880 per ounce. That means the dollar has lost it's value 233 times to gold since the 1930s. \\- Equities performed very well, despite early volatility. The S&P 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7,000 recently (trading around 6,800 as I am writing this). \\- Real Estate compounded strongly. The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States (ASPUS - a statistic from FRED) went from $19,300 in 1963 to $512,800 in Q2 of 2025. \\- Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles, rising from roughly $1.50/oz in the early 1970s to \\~$95/oz today. \\- Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3$ per barrel in the early 70s to \\~60$ per barrel. Early stock markets were far more volatile than today. During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90%. Over time, owning productive businesses proved resilient not because volatility disappeared, but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules. Gold followed a similar path, from money to restricted asset, to restricted reserve and finally a long-term hedge against currency debasement. Today, digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process. Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply. Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value, settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain. How do you think monetary policy will evolve? Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution?",

      "selftext_processed": "Many of you know this but in the last century money changed three times 1 . 19331934 During the Great Depression the US government banned the ownership of gold . Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $ 20.67 per ounce . Shortly after people turned in their gold the US government revalued gold at 35 $ per ounce effectively devaluing the dollar overnight . 2 . 19441971 After World War II a new system was created the Bretton Woods system . The US dollar became the worlds reserve currency convertible to gold at $ 35 per ounce for foreign governments central banks . Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars while gold was stored in US government vaults . This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves . 3 . 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely . Money was backed by trust institutions and policy . Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods the Federal Reserve ’ s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility . After Bretton Woods ended in 1971 those constraints disappeared giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve 8 metric tons of gold was accumulated before 1971 first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold . The same 8000 tons of US gold were valued at $ 5B in 1933 $ 9B after the 1934 revaluation and would be worth over $ 1.25T today at market prices . This lead to assets going up in value drastically . Today gold is valued at $ 4880 per ounce . That means the dollar has lost its value 233 times to gold since the 1930s . Equities performed very well despite early volatility . The SP 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7000 recently trading around 6800 as I am writing this . Real Estate compounded strongly . The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States ASPUS a statistic from FRED went from $ 19300 in 1963 to $ 512800 in Q2 of 2025 . Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles rising from roughly $ 1.50oz in the early 1970s to $ 95oz today . Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3 $ per barrel in the early 70s to 60 $ per barrel . Early stock markets were far more volatile than today . During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90 % . Over time owning productive businesses proved resilient not_because volatility disappeared but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules . Gold followed a similar path from money to restricted asset to restricted reserve and finally a longterm hedge against currency debasement . Today digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process . Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply . Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain . How do you think monetary policy will evolve Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution"

      "selftext": "Looking at the cross-asset snapshot (SPY/QQQ down \\~2%, ARKK down more, BTC/ETH weak, long yields still elevated, and gold up hard), the message doesn’t feel like a clean “growth scare” or a clean “inflation scare.” It reads more like: the constraint is financing, and the adjustment is getting pushed into the places that can move fastest (risk premia, multiples, labor). A useful way to frame it is: stop asking “soft landing or recession?” and ask “where does the system externalize adjustment: prices, profits, or people?” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and still-meaningful financing rates, companies tend to defend mrgns first. This often means labor becomes the shock absorber (hiring slows, layoffs, wage pressure), while capex gets more selective, concentrated into productivity tech and “bottleneck control, not broad expansion. The non-obvious link here is the long end. When long yields stay firm while equities sell off, that’s not the market offering relief. It’s tightening the hurdle rate. That’s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn’t fall is interesting: it can be less “inflation hedge” and more “trust hedge/regime hedge.” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective, some things find bids, a lot of things don’t. **Quick asset paths (just how I’d map scenarios):** Gold: can keep working if stress is about confidence/term premium, even if stocks are weak. If yields actually roll over cleanly, gold can go sideways while risk re-rates. BTC: tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity + reflexivity. If the funding constraint persists, BTC can stay heavy; if policy/liquidity engineering shows up, it can move violently. ETH: usually higher beta than BTC, often needs “easy conditions” more. Watch ETH/BTC for whether liquidty is broadening. Tech companies like AMD/NVDA: caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity (duration). If yields stabilize/fall, multiples can re-rate fast; if term premium stays sticky, “good company, bad tape” can persist. If this is the right read, “solutions” probably don’t look like a simple Fed cut story. More likely it’s a mix of liquidity plumbing, debt management, and,or implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable. The trade-off is you don’t get a stable “everything rallies” regime, you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks.",

A useful way to frame it is stop asking “ soft landing or recession ” and ask “ where does the system externalize adjustment prices profits or people ” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and stillmeaningful financing rates companies tend to defend mrgns first . This often means labor becomes the shock absorber hiring slows layoffs wage pressure while capex gets more selective concentrated into productivity tech and “ bottleneck control not_broad expansion . The nonobvious link here is the long end . When long yields stay firm while equities sell off that ’ s not_the market offering relief . It ’ s tightening the hurdle rate . That ’ s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn ’ t fall is interesting it can be less “ inflation hedge ” and more “ trust hedgeregime hedge. ” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective some things find bids a lot of things don ’ t . Quick asset paths just how I ’ d map scenarios Gold can keep working if stress is about confidenceterm premium even if stocks are weak . If yields actually roll over cleanly gold can go sideways while risk rerates . BTC tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity reflexivity . If the funding constraint persists BTC can stay heavy if policyliquidity engineering shows up it can move violently . ETH usually higher beta than BTC often needs “ easy conditions ” more . Watch ETHBTC for whether liquidty is broadening . Tech companies like AMDNVDA caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity duration . If yields stabilizefall multiples can rerate fast if term premium stays sticky “ good company bad tape ” can persist . If this is the right read “ solutions ” probably don ’ t look like a simple Fed cut story . More likely it ’ s a mix of liquidity plumbing debt management andor implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable . The tradeoff is you don ’ t get a stable “ everything rallies ” regime you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks ."

He brushed off the recent market chaos caused by Trump’s threat to slap 10% to 25% tariffs on several European allies if they don’t help make the deal happen. Even though some international investors started dumping U.S. Treasuries in response, Bessent claimed the idea of a global selloff is just a false narrative. He insisted that U.S. debt is still the safest bet around and urged world leaders to stay cool while the administration focuses on shoring up national security.",

Even though some international investors started dumping U.S. Treasuries in response Bessent claimed the idea of a global selloff is just a false narrative . He insisted that U.S. debt is still the safest bet around and urged world leaders to stay cool while the administration focuses on shoring up national security ."

      "title": "Why Are People So Negative on HIMS? “No Moat” Argument Feels Overblown",
      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately, and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no moat and will get crushed by competition. I’m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic. Yes, telehealth is competitive. Yes, a lot of companies can sell ED meds, hair loss treatments, etc. But HIMS isn’t just standing still or doing the bare minimum. They’re rolling out at-home lab testing, expanding into menopause / perimenopause care, and even getting into peptides. Those are not trivial add-ons. I honestly haven’t seen many competitors offering at-home labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform. To me, the moat argument misses a few things: Ecosystem > single product. Someone who does labs + ongoing treatment + subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once. Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast. Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings, not late-stage commoditized stuff. Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare. I get the concerns around: Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro, Amazon, traditional healthcare, etc. But saying “no moat” feels lazy. Not every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it’s distribution, trust, brand, and integration. So I’m genuinely curious: Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance? Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company? Or is there something structurally broken here that I’m missing? Not trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder, more defensible areas, not easier ones. Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “competition bad.”",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no_moat and will get crushed by competition . I ’ m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic . Yes telehealth is competitive . Yes a lot of companies can sell ED meds hair loss treatments etc . But HIMS isn ’ t just standing still or doing the bare minimum . They ’ re rolling out athome lab testing expanding into menopause perimenopause care and even getting into peptides . Those are not_trivial addons . I honestly haven ’ t seen many competitors offering athome labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform . To me the moat argument misses a few things Ecosystem single product . Someone who does labs ongoing treatment subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once . Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast . Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings not_latestage commoditized stuff . Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare . I get the concerns around Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro Amazon traditional healthcare etc . But saying “ no moat ” feels lazy . Not_every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it ’ s distribution trust brand and integration . So I ’ m genuinely curious Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company Or is there something structurally broken here that I ’ m missing Not_trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder more defensible areas not_easier ones . Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “ competition bad . ”"

      "selftext": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you might have come across at least 1 news article on the metal industry boom and metal stocks hitting their all-time highs, mainly silver and copper stocks like Vedanta and Hindustan Copper. According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high: Copper prices jumped to an all-time high of $13,253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela, a key region for natural resources. • Critical minerals theme: According to market experts, metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order. • Impact of US Fed rate cut: The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities. • Supply-side concerns: Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs have added to positive sentiment. • Aluminium price rise: Aluminium prices also moved higher, driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong long-term demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy. In view of these factors, stocks like Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest. Which is your fav stock at the moment?",

According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high Copper prices jumped to an alltime high of $ 13253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela a key region for natural resources . • Critical minerals theme According to market experts metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order . • Impact of US Fed rate cut The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities . • Supplyside concerns Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sectorspecific tariffs have added to positive sentiment . • Aluminium price rise Aluminium prices also moved higher driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong longterm demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy . In view of these factors stocks like Vedanta Hindustan Zinc Hindustan Copper Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest . Which is your fav stock at the moment"

Most of it was received from my parents and grandparents, collected over time as gifts on special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. My collection includes full silver cutlery sets (forks, knives, spoons) as well as jewelry, including bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, and chains. The silver, in its physical form, has a total combined weight of approximately 10 kilograms (≈320 troy ounces). If the market price of silver reaches $100 per ounce, one might think the total value would be $100 × 320 = $32,000. Are there ways to get closer to the full market (spot) price) for my silver?",

He's still buying. His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2. **BlackRock's 6M Share Position** — This isn't a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team. BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4% of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fund/client account. 3. **Tribeca (7.9%)** — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources. They're long-term holders, not day traders. 4. **81.7% Institutional** — Only \\~18% of shares are held by retail. When institutions own this much and none are selling, there's no supply. **The Price Dynamics:** |Factor|Effect| |:-|:-| |Low float (\\~30M shares)|Small buying pressure = big price moves (what we're seeing)| |Sprott adding, not selling|Largest holder is a buyer| |No short-term flippers|Patient, thesis-driven holders| **Why the Stock Doesn't Sell Off:** When a stock rises 13x (from $3.50 to $45), you normally see profit-taking. Not here. Why? * **Sprott's cost basis is \\~$5/share** — He's up 9x and still buying at $33. No exit pressure. * **Institutions bought for the takeover** — They're not selling before the a major is forced to buy # Part 6: The Risks |Risk|Mitigation| |:-|:-| |MRE disappoints|Eric's buying pattern suggests otherwise| |Metallurgical issues|Nov 2025 study showed 93% Ag recovery + potential roasting feasibility| |Commodity price drop|Silver has structural deficit (5 years)| |Execution risk|Diane has track record (built Romarco)| |Dilution|Higher stock = less dilution needed| # Part 7: Price Targets |Scenario|Share Price|Multiple from $45| |:-|:-|:-| |MRE Disappointment|$30-35|\\-20% to -30%| |MRE Meets Expectations|$70-90|1.5-2x| |MRE Beats Expectations|$100-130|2-3x| |Takeout (2026-2027)|$130-175|3-4x| # Positions \\-11k in shares, 50 in Feb 25$ calls, 45 in May 30$ calls Up: \\~+300k USD (Positions in SGD) [SGD - USD - SGD](",

His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2 . BlackRocks 6M Share Position — This isnt a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team . BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4 % of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fundclient account . 3 . Tribeca 7.9 % — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources . Theyre longterm holders not_day traders . 4 . 81.7 % Institutional — Only 18 % of shares are held by retail . When institutions own this much and none are selling theres no_supply . The Price Dynamics FactorEffect Low float 30M sharesSmall buying pressure big price moves what were seeing Sprott adding not_sellingLargest holder is a buyer No shortterm flippersPatient thesisdriven holders Why the Stock Doesnt Sell Off When a stock rises 13x from $ 3.50 to $ 45 you normally see profittaking . Not_here . Why Sprotts cost basis is $ 5share — Hes up 9x and still buying at $ 33 . No_exit pressure .

      "selftext": "Sold 31 $25 2/20 $AXTI Cash Secured Puts (\\~31DTE). Why? Desperation. On December 1st, I moved apartments because my side and upstairs neighbors would alternate blasting music in the middle of the night. The leasing office and security did Jack shit. I was a pussy and didn't call the cops. So I just moved. Well here's the problem, in the beginning of January, someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place, and is stomping and jumping on the floor. I tried talking to them, but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump. Ok, not a problem, I can deal with this. except, now they do it in the middle of the night. I don't think they have a job, because I hear this at 1am and 9am alike. I spoke with the leasing office, and get this, the ceilings on the 1st floor units are thinner. when first I moved in, they phrased it as \"The first floor units have extra tall ceilings!\" 😭 Anyway, if AXTI is more than $25 on Feb 20th, then the 18.6k in premium would more than cover breaking my current lease, moving into a new apartment complex (ON THE TOP FLOOR THIS TIME), a new phone for my mom, and the Valve Steam frame for my homie who helped me though all this. oh and taxes of course. You might think this is stupid, and yes, it is, but I've been spiraling these past 6 months. The lack of sleep and constant headache in my old apartment did a number on my mental health. Then, management at my job was going to layoff my entire department, but turns out the new company that was to replace us, didn't have product knowledge. So, a few coworkers and I escaped the layoffs for now. And now, this new apartment upstairs neighbor situation is draining me. I was 170lb in September, I'm now 155lb from all this stress.",

      "selftext": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now. NFLX is currently down 30+% over the last 3 months, and is currently looking to be down another 5% after the long weekend. NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don’t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years, but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth. First things first, NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company, with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report. I don’t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is. I just want to talk the politics. The big money maker? WBS The deal is happening. It’s very clear the deal is happening. WBS wants it, NFLX wants it, the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump, which I don’t see happening. Once this deal goes through, Netflix will have the monopoly. While every other entertainment company (YouTube, Insta, FB, TikTok, etc.) focus on short form entertainment. The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix, going all the way to production, not just rights to stream the movie. Netflix is just going to get bigger, and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again. Depending on when the deal goes through, I could potentially see NFLX rising 50% this year alone, and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years. I’m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix, keeping in MU until 400, and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note: Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term. Stranger things finale sucked ass = Lower Stock. I could potentially see it going as low as 75, but over the next year-2 NFLX will see explosive growth. Thoughts?",

NFLX is currently down 30 % over the last 3 months and is currently looking to be down another 5 % after the long weekend . NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don ’ t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth . First things first NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report . I don ’ t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is . I just want to talk the politics . The big money maker WBS The deal is happening . It ’ s very clear the deal is happening . WBS wants it NFLX wants it the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump which I don ’ t see happening . Once this deal goes through Netflix will have the monopoly . While every other entertainment company YouTube Insta FB TikTok etc . focus on short form entertainment . The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix going all the way to production not_just rights to stream the movie . Netflix is just going to get bigger and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again . Depending on when the deal goes through I could potentially see NFLX rising 50 % this year alone and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years . I ’ m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix keeping in MU until 400 and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term . Stranger things finale sucked ass Lower Stock . I could potentially see it going as low as 75 but over the next year2 NFLX will see explosive growth . Thoughts"
