      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets|\\+33.57%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "Football is the most-watched event in the United States. Over the next month, the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape. Last year, seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games. The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each. Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest. Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada. Up until 2018, Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘enjoy’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game. On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). By doing so, it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Today, thirty-eight states permit sports wagering in their areas. Now, another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray. They are called prediction markets. Over the last year, the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports, politics, business, weather, travel, and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption. The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events, and specifically football. Why does this matter for the investment world? Increasingly, the public uses its money to try to make a profit. Traditionally, the investment world was the domain where that took place. Over the last twenty years, as markets have become digitized, custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices, especially smartphones. Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity. If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options, levered ETFs, levered ETFs on single stocks, and ETFs related to any geography or activity, one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are, at the very least, blurring. The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi. Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products. In October of 2025, Polymarket received a $2 billion investment at a $9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide access to prediction products for institutions. Kalshi, the leader in global prediction markets with a 60% share and annual trading volume of over $50 billion, obtained $300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia, Andreesen-Horwitz, A16z, and Paradigm. Interestingly, one of the best-performing stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood, the online broker. When any entity suddenly finds a one-hundred-million-dollar run-rate business in less than a year, especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues, investors react favorably. As the prediction entities have gained adoption, the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically. More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas, the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6% in 2025 (perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026?) []( [Share](%%share_url%%) Whenever there is a competitive alternative, incumbents will respond to protect their market share. FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association. The following week, both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms (in partnership with the CME Group, the publicly traded futures exchange). Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry. From a regulatory standpoint, the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, it views the product as a financial derivative and not gambling. Anti-fraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘clarify’ the legal boundaries. In Congress, our on-the-ball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members (The ex-madame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember). So how should investors view this whole situation? The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting. However, betting and gambling are different. In gaming, there is a definite outcome, and the only thing one owns is the chance that one’s prediction, wager, hand, throw of the dice, or pull of the machine turns out correctly. When one invests, you own an entity that has assets and liabilities. In most cases, those assets and liabilities form operating businesses. The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity. From my perspective, and I have written this on numerous occasions, my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino. The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges, suppliers of gaming, and some underlying offshoot of both. Yes, Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged. It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and I certainly will be paying attention.",

      "selftext_processed": "Football is the mostwatched event in the United States . Over the next month the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape . Last year seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games . The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each . Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest . Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada . Up until 2018 Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘ enjoy ’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game . On May 14 2018 the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act PASPA . By doing so it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting . Today thirtyeight states permit sports wagering in their areas . Now another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray . They are called prediction markets . Over the last year the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports politics business weather travel and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption . The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events and specifically football . Why does this matter for the investment world Increasingly the public uses its money to try to make a profit . Traditionally the investment world was the domain where that took place . Over the last twenty years as markets have become digitized custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices especially smartphones . Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity . If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options levered ETFs levered ETFs on single stocks and ETFs related to any geography or activity one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are at the very least blurring . The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi . Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products . In October of 2025 Polymarket received a $ 2 billion investment at a $ 9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange ICE to provide access to prediction products for institutions . Kalshi the leader in global prediction markets with a 60 % share and annual trading volume of over $ 50 billion obtained $ 300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia AndreesenHorwitz A16z and Paradigm . Interestingly one of the bestperforming stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood the online broker . When any entity suddenly finds a onehundredmilliondollar runrate business in less than a year especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues investors react favorably . As the prediction entities have gained adoption the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically . More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6 % in 2025 perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026 Share % % share_url % % Whenever there is a competitive alternative incumbents will respond to protect their market share . FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association . The following week both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms in partnership with the CME Group the publicly traded futures exchange . Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry . From a regulatory standpoint the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC . Currently it views the product as a financial derivative and not_gambling . Antifraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘ clarify ’ the legal boundaries . In Congress our ontheball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members The exmadame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember . So how should investors view this whole situation The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting . However betting and gambling are different . In gaming there is a definite outcome and the only thing one owns is the chance that one ’ s prediction wager hand throw of the dice or pull of the machine turns out correctly . When one invests you own an entity that has assets and liabilities . In most cases those assets and liabilities form operating businesses . The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity . From my perspective and I have written this on numerous occasions my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino . The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges suppliers of gaming and some underlying offshoot of both . Yes Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged . It will be interesting to see how this evolves and I certainly will be paying attention ."

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets|\\+33.57%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "I’m looking to understand how people would think about allocating capital given the following hypothetical scenario, and I’m interested in the reasoning and frameworks behind different approaches rather than personal financial advice. Scenario: Assume the ability to invest $100,000 annually consistently over the next 10-15 years, with the goal of long-term wealth building while also allowing for some medium-term opportunities. I’ve been reading about a mix of: • long-term compounding assets (equities, funds, etc.) • real estate (residential, multi-unit, or commercial) as a long-game strategy • higher-risk asymmetric assets (e.g., Bitcoin or similar alternatives) as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10+ year horizon, while still allowing for some shorter- to medium-term opportunities. Relevant parameters for context: • Age: early 30s • Location: Southern California, USA (open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida) • Employment: self-employed • Monthly income: \\~$17,000–$20,000 • Debt: none • Liquidity: high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance: moderate-to-high (comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term upside) • Time horizon: primarily 10+ years, with openness to some shorter-term plays alongside long-term compounding",

Scenario Assume the ability to invest $ 100000 annually consistently over the next 1015 years with the goal of longterm wealth building while also allowing for some mediumterm opportunities . I ’ ve been reading about a mix of • longterm compounding assets equities funds etc . • real estate residential multiunit or commercial as a longgame strategy • higherrisk asymmetric assets e.g . Bitcoin or similar alternatives as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10 year horizon while still allowing for some shorter to mediumterm opportunities . Relevant parameters for context • Age early 30s • Location Southern California USA open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida • Employment selfemployed • Monthly income $ 17000– $ 20000 • Debt none • Liquidity high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance moderatetohigh comfortable with volatility in exchange for longterm upside • Time horizon primarily 10 years with openness to some shorterterm plays alongside longterm compounding"

I can afford it as I am young and earn well. Questions: 1. I am a long term believer in AI. But there can be short term dips along the way (like in March 2025). How do I set myself in a position to make the best use of such opportunities? I earn 3.3% APY on cash in my brokerage account but honestly I don't trust USD. I'm wondering if I should keep 10% of my portfolio in gold. When market goes down, gold goes up, and I will have the option to sell my gold to buy stocks at discounted prices. Thoughts? I don't trust crypto either. 2. Any other advice on my portfolio? I will either sell TTD and AMZN or increase my position in them, as right now they are just noise. Also, planning to slowly increase SPYM to be 25-30% of my portfolio. Thank you very much for reading and I appreciate any feedback/suggestion!",

I can afford it as I am young and earn well . Questions 1 . I am a long term believer in AI . But there can be short term dips along the way like in March 2025 . How do I set myself in a position to make the best use of such opportunities I earn 3.3 % APY on cash in my brokerage account but honestly I dont trust USD . Im wondering if I should keep 10 % of my portfolio in gold . When market goes down gold goes up and I will have the option to sell my gold to buy stocks at discounted prices . Thoughts I dont trust crypto either . 2 . Any other advice on my portfolio I will either sell TTD and AMZN or increase my position in them as right now they are just noise . Also planning to slowly increase SPYM to be 2530 % of my portfolio . Thank you very much for reading and I appreciate any feedbacksuggestion"

      "selftext": "Came back from the depths of hell in my individual accounts. Doubled my retirement accounts, went from $5k to $30k in my Roth. It was an insanely turbulent year but thankful I ended green for the first time since 2021 (shorted most of the bull market 🫠) My biggest plays were full porting $BABA at $85 and riding most to $170. Going heavy $OPEN at $.80c but left a lot on the table after $3. I had 2000 shares of $IREN and sold at $10 which was a pivotal mistake. My last big play of the year was apeing $TSLA calls and some tech puts in November. Seeing how January starts off with most of MSM mega bullish and all of Fintwit expecting a downturn. I think $BIDU continues to go up and planning to go heavy there. I also like $RDW for space and drone theme as a moonshot. My other plays are robotics and software in names like $SYM $TER $PATH & $NOW $CRM. $NKE is due for a run back to $80 and think consumer stocks can bounce more. I also think I will short shares of $PLTR & $HOOD as a hedge. Let me know what plays you’re looking at and wish every one a happy new year and good luck in 2026!! 🙏",

      "selftext_processed": "Came back from the depths of hell in my individual accounts . Doubled my retirement accounts went from $ 5k to $ 30k in my Roth . It was an insanely turbulent year but thankful I ended green for the first time since 2021 shorted most of the bull market 🫠 My biggest plays were full porting $ BABA at $ 85 and riding most to $ 170 . Going heavy $ OPEN at $ .80c but left a lot on the table after $ 3 . I had 2000 shares of $ IREN and sold at $ 10 which was a pivotal mistake . My last big play of the year was apeing $ TSLA calls and some tech puts in November . Seeing how January starts off with most of MSM mega bullish and all of Fintwit expecting a downturn . I think $ BIDU continues to go up and planning to go heavy there . I also like $ RDW for space and drone theme as a moonshot . My other plays are robotics and software in names like $ SYM $ TER $ PATH $ NOW $ CRM . $ NKE is due for a run back to $ 80 and think consumer stocks can bounce more . I also think I will short shares of $ PLTR $ HOOD as a hedge . Let me know what plays you ’ re looking at and wish every one a happy new year and good luck in 2026 🙏"

      "selftext": "Wrapping up the year with a pretty familiar setup for me. I’m still overweight big cap tech / AI adjacent names, mainly because the fundamentals and cash flow are hard to ignore but I’ve definitely been trimming into strength and sitting on more cash than earlier this year. This week’s price action didn’t really change my mind either. Thin volume, quiet selloff, some metals suddenly ripping, and TSLA guiding a bit lower feels more like rotation + year end positioning than fear. My approach going into 2026 is pretty simple: Core positions in large, profitable tech I’m comfortable holding through volatility Some shorter term trades when setups are clean More cash than usual, waiting for better risk/reward instead of chasing After trading through a few cycles, I’ve learned I don’t need to be “all in” at year end. I’d rather stay flexible and let the market show its hand in Q1. Curious how others here are positioned right now: Still fully invested? I’m intentionally avoiding smaller speculative names right now. I’ve been burned enough times chasing narratives when liquidity dries up.",

This week ’ s price action didn ’ t really change my mind either . Thin volume quiet selloff some metals suddenly ripping and TSLA guiding a bit lower feels more like rotation year end positioning than fear . My approach going into 2026 is pretty simple Core positions in large profitable tech I ’ m comfortable holding through volatility Some shorter term trades when setups are clean More cash than usual waiting for better riskreward instead of chasing After trading through a few cycles I ’ ve learned I don ’ t need to be “ all in ” at year end . I ’ d rather stay flexible and let the market show its hand in Q1 . Curious how others here are positioned right now Still fully invested I ’ m intentionally avoiding smaller speculative names right now . I ’ ve been burned enough times chasing narratives when liquidity dries up ."

      "selftext": "JPMorgan expects the labor market to slow in early 2026, followed by gradual improvement in the latter half of the year. The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies, which have reduced labor supply. Monthly job growth may decline from 50,000 to 15,000 as businesses remain cautious. Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually. I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year, particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology. As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor, automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform. While near-term gains may prove elusive, a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate. What are your thoughts on this?",

The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies which have reduced labor supply . Monthly job growth may decline from 50000 to 15000 as businesses remain cautious . Despite the slowdown in job growth the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually . I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology . As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform . While nearterm gains may prove elusive a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate . What are your thoughts on this"

Everyone is scared about the fragile ecomony, but all they are doing is prologing the inevitable. Having rates at close to 0% for around 20 years has done irreversible harm and is the reason why so many worthless tech companys were selling for billions of dollars. Now we have AI which still has yet to produce any use case other than videos what cost tons of energy and have raised energy rates for average every day people. Seems pretty simple, but once smart people get in a room together they circle jerk their way into convincing themselves we can grow ourselves out of the issue. Not realizing it will never work.",

Everyone is scared about the fragile ecomony but all they are doing is prologing the inevitable . Having rates at close to 0 % for around 20 years has done irreversible harm and is the reason why so many worthless tech companys were selling for billions of dollars . Now we have AI which still has yet to produce any use case other than videos what cost tons of energy and have raised energy rates for average every day people . Seems pretty simple but once smart people get in a room together they circle jerk their way into convincing themselves we can grow ourselves out of the issue . Not_realizing it will never_work ."

      "selftext": "I've begun seriously considering whether to reduce or exit my Tesla position. Background: I've held Tesla (TSLA) for over three years. Long-term, I still believe the stock could reach $500 next year, but its recent performance... has been disappointing. Even as the broader market resumed its rally, TSLA failed to follow suit. Therefore, I'm contemplating: Limited upside potential over the next six months Volatility has significantly decreased compared to previous years TSLA currently constitutes an excessive portion of my portfolio, raising concerns from a risk perspective Consequently, I'm considering whether to redirect some capital toward more stable defensive plays like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), or select other low-volatility, dividend-paying stocks to smooth investment fluctuations. This isn't a bearish stance on Tesla itself, but rather a consideration of opportunity cost and concentration risk. Seeking others' perspectives: Would you hold TSLA through this volatility? Reduce exposure while maintaining core holdings? Switch to dividend/defensive stocks? Looking forward to diverse viewpoints, especially from fellow long-term TSLA investors.",

      "selftext": "While the stock market continues to hit all-time highs, the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating. We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a K-shaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living. For the average person, the economy has been in a recession for a year, while the top quintile rides an AI-fueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest over-investment bubble in history. Big Tech is currently pouring over $200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips, yet we are still waiting for a mass-market business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex. And even if there will be a business model, it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising....Just as a side note. The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance. With US national debt crossing $37 trillion, the interest payments alone have breached the $1 trillion mark, now exceeding the entire defense budget. The Fed is trapped in a \"no-win\" scenario: they cannot hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury, but they cannot cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by de-globalization and China’s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse. Simultaneously, the global liquidity taps are being turned off. The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money, and as rates hit the 1% mark, the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets. This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a \"wild\" 2026 bond auction season, taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring. Another hidden fuse (or rather gasoline), however, is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs. We have a massive \"shadow banking\" sector in private credit that hasn't been stress-tested in a high-rate environment. On the other side, when the AI bubble pops, the ETF correlation trap snaps shut. Because passive investing now dominates the market, a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously, driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0. This won't stay confined to the stock market; it will bleed into the housing market. I haven't even touched on the cost of living, US/France/Germany Bond auctions etc. Now my question: Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion? As the Fed is no position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm?",

      "selftext_processed": "While the stock market continues to hit alltime highs the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating . We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a Kshaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living . For the average person the economy has been in a recession for a year while the top quintile rides an AIfueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest overinvestment bubble in history . Big Tech is currently pouring over $ 200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips yet we are still waiting for a massmarket business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex . And even if there will be a business model it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising .... Just as a side note . The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance . With US national debt crossing $ 37 trillion the interest payments alone have breached the $ 1 trillion mark now exceeding the entire defense budget . The Fed is trapped in a nowin scenario they can not hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury but they can not cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by deglobalization and China ’ s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse . Simultaneously the global liquidity taps are being turned off . The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money and as rates hit the 1 % mark the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets . This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a wild 2026 bond auction season taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring . Another hidden fuse or rather gasoline however is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs . We have a massive shadow banking sector in private credit that hasnt been stresstested in a highrate environment . On the other side when the AI bubble pops the ETF correlation trap snaps shut . Because passive investing now dominates the market a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0 . This wont stay confined to the stock market it will bleed into the housing market . I havent even touched on the cost of living USFranceGermany Bond auctions etc . Now my question Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion As the Fed is no_position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm"

      "title": "The \"Trump trade\" is accelerating: Five brand-new \"America First\" ETFs have launched on the New York Stock Exchange.",
      "selftext": "Just yesterday (December 30th), Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) officially launched five new ETFs through its fintech brand \"Truth.Fi\". Although $DJT's stock price fell by 4.5% after the announcement (a typical \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" scenario), the underlying holdings of these funds reveal the current administration's economic strategy for 2026. The \"America First\" Five: TSSD (Security and Defense): Heavily invested in Palantir ($PLTR) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW). This isn't just about tanks and cannons, but rather AI-driven warfare logic. TSFN (Next Frontier): Focused on \"breakthrough\" technologies, appearing to be a high-beta play on domestic innovation. TSIC (American Idols): Investing in blue-chip brands that represent the \"American spirit.\" TSES (Energy Security): This is an interesting mix, including both ExxonMobil ($XOM) and utility stocks like Constellation Energy ($CEG), betting on a \"fracking frenzy\" policy to meet the power demands of AI. TSRS (Red State Real Estate Trust): Specifically targeting real estate in conservative-leaning states. This is a pure play on the trend of population migration inland. Why is this worth paying attention to now? Although the 0.65% management fee is slightly high, the timing is very precise. With the 25% auto tariff and reciprocal trade act set to take full effect in early 2026, these funds aim to capture the benefits of \"manufacturing reshoring.\" Furthermore, with the SEC's changing stance, there are strong calls for the group to launch a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency ETF in early 2026. The core question: Are these funds merely \"political stunts,\" or can they truly generate excess returns by tracking specific sectors supported by the government?",

The America First Five TSSD Security and Defense Heavily invested in Palantir $ PLTR and Palo Alto Networks $ PANW . This isnt just about tanks and cannons but rather AIdriven warfare logic . TSFN Next Frontier Focused on breakthrough technologies appearing to be a highbeta play on domestic innovation . TSIC American Idols Investing in bluechip brands that represent the American spirit . TSES Energy Security This is an interesting mix including both ExxonMobil $ XOM and utility stocks like Constellation Energy $ CEG betting on a fracking frenzy policy to meet the power demands of AI . TSRS Red State Real Estate Trust Specifically targeting real estate in conservativeleaning states . This is a pure play on the trend of population migration inland . Why is this worth paying attention to now Although the 0.65 % management fee is slightly high the timing is very precise . With the 25 % auto tariff and reciprocal trade act set to take full effect in early 2026 these funds aim to capture the benefits of manufacturing reshoring . Furthermore with the SECs changing stance there are strong calls for the group to launch a Bitcoincryptocurrency ETF in early 2026 . The core question Are these funds merely political stunts or can they truly generate excess returns by tracking specific sectors supported by the government"

      "selftext": "Semiconductor stocks were mostly lower to end the 2025 trading year, as investors looked to lock in profits heading into 2026. However, NVDA bucked the trend, posting a modest gain after reports emerged that the company had approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM to increase production of its H200 GPUs, amid a surge in Chinese demand. TSM shares rose 2% on the news. Other semiconductor stocks also declined at the close, including Micron (MU), whose market value has surged this year. Micron's stock fell 1.6% on Wednesday but has risen over 220% due to robust AI demand. Storage companies Seagate Technology (STX), SanDisk (SNDK), and Western Digital (WDC) also saw similar declines on Wednesday. However, like Micron, these three companies have also seen their 2025 valuations surge significantly due to AI investments. Storage and traditional semiconductor companies have significantly outperformed the broader market this year. Do you believe this trend can continue through 2026? Will you continue holding these leading semiconductor stocks, or consider reallocating during short term volatility?",

Will be nimble (e.g. take profits, reallocate to better performing opportunities, cut losses, etc.) First pick - PAA - inspired by the drill baby drill post from a couple years ago! - PAA continues to execute: year over year EBITDA growth, deleveraging, making add-on acquisitions, and divesting non-core businesses - Low IV: makes sense given it’s a dividend stock, but IV is historically low. Can pick up Jan 2027 $20C for $0.40. A 5% rise in underlying stock price should make these double. a 10% rise would triple and a 14% rise would make these quadruple. - Attractive valuation: trading at sub 7x EV / EBITDA which is less than peers (ET trades for 8.5x) Will keep you updated on all future trades.

Can pick up Jan 2027 $ 20C for $ 0.40 . A 5 % rise in underlying stock price should make these double . a 10 % rise would triple and a 14 % rise would make these quadruple .

For the past year, I’ve primarily been more theta gang as I’ve been selling several weekly CSPs for income and I occasionally sell CCs on my long stock positions when I believe they’re overbought.

      "selftext": "China’s demand for Nvidia’s H200 chips reflects both technological dependence and strategic urgency. Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the gold standard for training and deploying large AI models. Their performance, software ecosystem (like CUDA and cuDNN), and integration with global AI frameworks make them hard to replace. China’s domestic alternatives lag behind. While China has made significant investments in chip design (e.g., Huawei’s Ascend, Alibaba’s Hanguang), these chips generally trail Nvidia in raw performance, software support, and developer adoption. U.S. export controls have also cut off access to advanced chip manufacturing tools, making it harder for Chinese firms to catch up quickly. Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent, and ByteDance are racing to develop competitive AI models. Without access to top-tier compute, they risk falling behind US rivals. Chinese firms are scrambling to secure as many Nvidia chips as possible based on uncertainty that U.S. restrictions may tighten again. This behavior signals a lack of domestic substitutes and a fear of future supply shocks.",

      "selftext": "I structured my portfolio with ETFs (VOO, VGT, QQQ) as the core and stocks as a smaller allocation (15–20%). Due to outsized gains in stocks like PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB, the stocks portion has now grown to 50% of the portfolio (stocks total is about $100k). Should I rebalance my portfolio? I sold about 30% of PLTR and RKLB late last year when they grew 6-7x, but since then they have grown another 2-3x (not sure if I should regret though lol). I’m currently considering the following options, but I’m open to other ideas: 1. Rebalance the current % in the table below to the new target % (mostly trimming PLTR, NVDA and RKLB to buy other stocks) 2. Trim PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB but move the money to ETFs 3. Do nothing and continue monthly contributions as usual What's your take? |Stock|Current %|New Target %|Comment| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |PLTR|26.4|19|High growth| |NVDA|22.5|20|High growth| |RKLB|14.2|10|High growth| |GOOGL|14.4|20| | |AMZN|7.5|9| | |AMD|4.5|5| | |TSLA|3.8| |Not a fan anymore| |LUNR|1.8|3|Added 2 months back| |NBIS|1.7|3|Added 2 months back| |ASTS|1.2|3|Added 2 months back| |S|1|2|Added 2 months back| |IONQ|1|1|Added 2 months back| |IREN| |2|New| |VRT| |3|New|",

      "selftext": "The trend lines are rather obvious. At some point, people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships, and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025, the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half (47%) of U.S. households are married couples, a slide from 66% fifty years ago. The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women, and 25% of 40-year-olds have never been married. Currently, 42% of U.S. adults are single, and for many, it isn't a choice; it’s structural isolation. GWI research shows that 80% of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months. Crucially, 31% of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation. The share of Americans who say they have no close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021. One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated. This has created a massive loneliness economy. The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $280 billion by 2032. Within this, the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode. Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8%, projecting the industry to hit $140.7 billion by 2030. In 2023, you could only text these things. In 2025, you could talk to them. By 2027, Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space. This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn’t a flop, it was just early. Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar. These use machine learning to generate photorealistic, real-time representations of humans, capturing subtle eye movements, skin texture, and mouth twitches. The Lex Fridman/Zuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together. Running these used to require a supercomputer, but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA) has significantly reduced compute requirements. By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair, Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4. Combine this with Meta’s absurd amount compute (they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350,000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600,000 H100s) and you have complete vertical integration &nbsp: - **The Brain:** Llama 4 and beyond. - **The Body:** GPiCA Codec Avatars. - **The Hardware:** Quest - **The Memory Software:** Reality Labs &nbsp: By 2030, people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends, All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out. IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit: A lot of people seem to doubt this. I’d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today. People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models. Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable. The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists. Like it or not, Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this",

      "selftext_processed": "The trend lines are rather obvious . At some point people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025 the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half 47 % of U.S. households are married couples a slide from 66 % fifty years ago . The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women and 25 % of 40yearolds have never_been married . Currently 42 % of U.S. adults are single and for many it isnt a choice it ’ s structural isolation . GWI research shows that 80 % of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months . Crucially 31 % of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation . The share of Americans who say they have no_close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021 . One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated . This has created a massive loneliness economy . The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $ 118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $ 280 billion by 2032 . Within this the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode . Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8 % projecting the industry to hit $ 140.7 billion by 2030 . In 2023 you could only text these things . In 2025 you could talk to them . By 2027 Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space . This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn ’ t a flop it was just early . Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar . These use machine learning to generate photorealistic realtime representations of humans capturing subtle eye movements skin texture and mouth twitches . The Lex FridmanZuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together . Running these used to require a supercomputer but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars GPiCA has significantly reduced compute requirements . By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4 . Combine this with Meta ’ s absurd amount compute they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600000 H100s and you have complete vertical integration nbsp The Brain Llama 4 and beyond . The Body GPiCA Codec Avatars . The Hardware Quest The Memory Software Reality Labs nbsp By 2030 people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out . IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit A lot of people seem to doubt this . I ’ d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today . People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models . Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable . The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists . Like it or not_Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this"

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching AppLovin Corporation (APP) closely lately and wanted to get some outside perspectives. APP has been one of the strongest performers in the ad-tech / mobile monetization space, driven largely by its AI powered ad optimization (Axon) and improving margins. Revenue growth has been strong, and the market clearly rewarded that over the past year. That said, at these levels, a few things I’m personally weighing: Valuation is no longer cheap, especially after the recent run-up Growth expectations feel very high going into the next earnings Regulatory and data-privacy headlines still seem like an overhang, even if nothing material has changed recently I’m not bearish on the business more just trying to decide whether this is a hold/add on pullbacks story or if expectations have gotten ahead of fundamentals in the short term. Curious how others here are thinking about APP: Long term compounder? Or a great company that’s priced for perfection right now? Not financial advice genuinely interested in discussion.",

APP has been one of the strongest performers in the adtech mobile monetization space driven largely by its AI powered ad optimization Axon and improving margins . Revenue growth has been strong and the market clearly rewarded that over the past year . That said at these levels a few things I ’ m personally weighing Valuation is no_longer cheap especially after the recent runup Growth expectations feel very high going into the next earnings Regulatory and dataprivacy headlines still seem like an overhang even if nothing_material has changed recently I ’ m not_bearish on the business more just trying to decide whether this is a holdadd on pullbacks story or if expectations have gotten ahead of fundamentals in the short term .

So far, I’ve been researching SOXX for semiconductor exposure and SKYY for cloud computing. I like the idea of using ETFs instead of picking individual tech stocks because of diversification and lower risk compared to betting on one company. I’m looking for more ETFs with similar exposure (AI, data centers, chips, cloud, software, etc.). What other ETFs should I research? Are there things I should be careful about, like fees, concentration risk, or too much overlap between funds?",

So far I ’ ve been researching SOXX for semiconductor exposure and SKYY for cloud computing . I like the idea of using ETFs instead of picking individual tech stocks because of diversification and lower risk compared to betting on one company . I ’ m looking for more ETFs with similar exposure AI data centers chips cloud software etc .. What other ETFs should I research Are there things I should be careful about like fees concentration risk or too much overlap between funds"

Hopefully that makes sense, but can someone explain that to me because I’m struggling to understand it. Thank you!",

      "selftext": "This might sound totally naive and maybe I’m just late to the party, but I can't shake this feeling that retail investors are being set up as the bag holders for 2026. I’ve been pretty optimistic about AI, but I was looking at the data recently and it’s freaking me out. Retail investors are buying in at record highs, but corporate insiders are selling at a 27:1 ratio right now. Why is 'smart money' cashing out so aggressively? Then you look at SoftBank, they are literally selling their winning stocks (Nvidia, T-Mobile) just to scrape together cash to pay OpenAI by the end of the year. It honestly feels like the whole industry is just trying to keep the valuation inflated long enough to IPO OpenAI next year so the VCs can exit. I don’t want to be a fearmonger but does this look like a massive wealth transfer setup to anyone else? Or am I just overthinking it? I know this isn't too different from the whole 'AI bubble' panic but I feel like the timeline seems more concrete now with Google's soon-to-be lead in AI.",

I ’ ve been pretty optimistic about AI but I was looking at the data recently and it ’ s freaking me out . Retail investors are buying in at record highs but corporate insiders are selling at a 271 ratio right now . Why is smart money cashing out so aggressively Then you look at SoftBank they are literally selling their winning stocks Nvidia TMobile just to scrape together cash to pay OpenAI by the end of the year . It honestly feels like the whole industry is just trying to keep the valuation inflated long enough to IPO OpenAI next year so the VCs can exit . I don ’ t want to be a fearmonger but does this look like a massive wealth transfer setup to anyone else Or am I just overthinking it I know this isnt too different from the whole AI bubble panic but I feel like the timeline seems more concrete now with Googles soontobe lead in AI ."

I understand RKLB is priced as a high-growth stock as it should be, but it seems as though FOMO and hype surrounding the space industry has risen to an unsustainable level. At 68X sales it looks like RKLB is almost priced for perfection. That being said, RKLB is an amazing company with an incredible opportunity to take significant market share as the 2nd space company in the US behind SpaceX. I know many of you likely got in early and will be holding long term. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on its current valuation relative to where the company is today. No one can predict the future, but do you think $70/share is a fair price to pay? If you had never invested in RKLB, would you now at the current price? Thanks in advance!",

I understand RKLB is priced as a highgrowth stock as it should be but it seems as though FOMO and hype surrounding the space industry has risen to an unsustainable level . At 68X sales it looks like RKLB is almost priced for perfection . That being said RKLB is an amazing company with an incredible opportunity to take significant market share as the 2nd space company in the US behind SpaceX . I know many of you likely got in early and will be holding long term . What I would love to hear is your thoughts on its current valuation relative to where the company is today . No_one can predict the future but do you think $ 70share is a fair price to pay If you had never_invested in RKLB would you now at the current price Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Couer Mining (CDE) closed the day at $18.09 according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext": "Hello, stock traders. I thought I'd share an idea with you. On another subreddit I'm on, someone had posted a list of \"low RSI\" stocks he'd screened (less than 30, but >10, to weed out anomalies), with prices above $2. The idea being that these might be oversold and/or due to go up for whatever reasons. I've never felt like I could predict *if* a stock should go up, let alone *when*. But I can tell when one **is** going up. We all can. So my mind immediately went to the *other* extreme of RSI, and I filtered above 70 (and <90). Share price above $50, and Volume >50k were the only other filters I used. I got 46 hits on Barchart, and in hindsight I could've lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates. And maybe price, but I personally wouldn't go <$20. I sorted by 3-month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up. Then I started flipping through charts using Barchart's \"flipcharts\" feature. Candidates I liked, *strictly based on their charts* (no other research) were: ALB, AA, AUGO, PAAS, GM, RIO, FDX, TD, & BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose (because I 'diversify' with just 3 tickers at a time), I charted those 9 against each other by 3's. That yielded these 3 charts: [9 stocks 3 ways, 6-month views]( Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts. (I use 6-month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is.) **Which stock from each chart would** ***you*** **choose?** I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view (and that influenced 2 picks), but I chose: >!AA, RIO, TD!< (Click to see. This is the 'spoiler' feature of Reddit.) As a final sanity check, I plotted them against each other, with SPY as the benchmark: [3 momentum picks vs SPY]( And tbh, I don't like how AA looks in this view, but that's down to it having been in the first tranche of 3, which were highest on the 3-month performance sort. But with the averaging effect of the other 2, I can live with it. I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwim's Paper Money to buy them at Monday's open. They filled at: AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days, but it's early yet. I could update this in a month or two if people are interested. Does anyone else do something like this?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello stock traders . I thought Id share an idea with you . On another subreddit Im on someone had posted a list of low RSI stocks hed screened less than 30 but 10 to weed out anomalies with prices above $ 2 . The idea being that these might be oversold andor due to go up for whatever reasons . Ive never_felt like I could predict if a stock should go up let alone when . But I can tell when one is going up . We all can . So my mind immediately went to the other extreme of RSI and I filtered above 70 and 90 . Share price above $ 50 and Volume 50k were the only other filters I used . I got 46 hits on Barchart and in hindsight I couldve lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates . And maybe price but I personally wouldnt go $ 20 . I sorted by 3month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up . Then I started flipping through charts using Barcharts flipcharts feature . Candidates I liked strictly based on their charts no other research were ALB AA AUGO PAAS GM RIO FDX TD BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose because I diversify with just 3 tickers at a time I charted those 9 against each other by 3s . That yielded these 3 charts 9 stocks 3 ways 6month views Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts . I use 6month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is . Which stock from each chart would you choose I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view and that influenced 2 picks but I chose AA RIO TD Click to see . This is the spoiler feature of Reddit . As a final sanity check I plotted them against each other with SPY as the benchmark 3 momentum picks vs SPY And tbh I dont like how AA looks in this view but thats down to it having been in the first tranche of 3 which were highest on the 3month performance sort . But with the averaging effect of the other 2 I can live with it . I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwims Paper Money to buy them at Mondays open . They filled at AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days but its early yet . I could update this in a month or two if people are interested . Does anyone else do something like this"

One question, I assume the gold relationship is per person? So I couldn’t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3% instead of 1? Also, can I buy CEFs, BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood? Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything (general question).

According to these projections, fourth-quarter deliveries may decline by approximately 15% year-over-year, a rare occurrence in Tesla's history. Key factors contributing to demand pressure include: Phasing Out Tax Credits: The gradual withdrawal of electric vehicle subsidies in certain markets significantly impacts marginal demand Intensifying Competition: Traditional automakers and new energy vehicle manufacturers are simultaneously ramping up efforts, fueling ongoing price wars Diminishing demand pull-forward effect: Previous price cuts have already captured some future demand This “pre-disclosure” strategy has also sparked market speculation: Is Tesla actively managing market expectations? Does this signal greater near-term fundamental pressures than previously anticipated? Or is it merely paving the way for a reset in the 2025 growth trajectory? From a trading and investment perspective, this could yield two starkly different interpretations: Bearish View: The high-growth narrative is weakening, necessitating a re-evaluation of valuations. Bullish View: Releasing negative news early could actually mitigate the impact after earnings reports. Tesla currently sits at the intersection of macroeconomic factors, industry competition, and its own growth trajectory. Heightened short-term volatility may become the norm. What are your thoughts? Is this expectation management, or a signal of a demand inflection point? Share your bullish or bearish perspectives.",

      "selftext": "For someone who has always focused on diversification, I've gotten in deep with my latest venture. Before 2023, I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor, with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs, Tech stocks, Real-Estate, and Crypto. On paper, it looked responsible. I slept well. Then in 2023, I made a big life change, relocated, and decided to go all-in on building a company. My third. Fast forward to today, and my personal balance sheet looks completely different. What used to be a \\~$300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset: my ownership equity in an operating fintech company. On paper, that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was (>$3m). In reality, my liquid position is now under 3% compared to 40% before my move. This bothers me. From one angle, this looks like rational concentration - founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highest-conviction asset right?. From another angle, it feels like I’ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside. I’m “wealthier” on paper, but functionally much poorer in cash. So I’m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective: • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management? • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid? • For those who’ve been through this, what did you wish you’d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside? Not looking for validation, genuinely interested in how others frame this trade-off. Am I overthinking it?",

      "selftext_processed": "For someone who has always focused on diversification Ive gotten in deep with my latest venture . Before 2023 I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs Tech stocks RealEstate and Crypto . On paper it looked responsible . I slept well . Then in 2023 I made a big life change relocated and decided to go allin on building a company . My third . Fast forward to today and my personal balance sheet looks completely different . What used to be a $ 300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset my ownership equity in an operating fintech company . On paper that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was $ 3m . In reality my liquid position is now under 3 % compared to 40 % before my move . This bothers me . From one angle this looks like rational concentration founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highestconviction asset right . From another angle it feels like I ’ ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside . I ’ m “ wealthier ” on paper but functionally much poorer in cash . So I ’ m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid • For those who ’ ve been through this what did you wish you ’ d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside Not_looking for validation genuinely interested in how others frame this tradeoff . Am I overthinking it"

They all have set times, like 5yr, 3yr, 6 months, 1 month, etc. I'd prefer to have the flexibility to put in exact months. And many screeners won't even let me put more than one filter for price change. Are there any screeners that will let me do this?

      "selftext": "I recently shifted my focus away from the volatility of the Q2 earnings report and back to Nike's core: its products. After years of criticism for rehashing old designs, Nike's 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its R&D capabilities again. Three recent (or upcoming) key releases have changed my perspective: The \"Unleashed\" Year of the Horse Collection: Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection. The special editions of the G.T. Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the Asia-Pacific region. If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market, it will be a huge support for the \"recovery logic.\" The \"Nike Mind\" Platform (launching January 2026): This is very cutting-edge. Nike is entering the \"neuroscience-based\" footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002. These shoes are designed to enhance \"sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet. This is a completely new category (Mind Science), and likely their response to the \"health/comfort\" trend pioneered by Hoka. 3D Printed Air Max 1000: The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology. Seeing the high premium for the \"Oat\" colorway on the secondary market shows that \"brand heat\" hasn't disappeared, but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously. Investor Question: CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a \"Win Now\" year. With North American wholesale business showing a 24% surge in the December 18th earnings report, are these new products enough to support building a long-term position below $65?",

After years of criticism for rehashing old designs Nikes 2026 product line finally seems to be showcasing its RD capabilities again . Three recent or upcoming key releases have changed my perspective The Unleashed Year of the Horse Collection Nike just released its 2026 Lunar New Year collection . The special editions of the G.T . Cut 4 and Ja 3 have already caused a huge sensation in the AsiaPacific region . If they can leverage this to stabilize the Greater China market it will be a huge support for the recovery logic . The Nike Mind Platform launching January 2026 This is very cuttingedge . Nike is entering the neurosciencebased footwear field with the Mind 001 and 002 . These shoes are designed to enhance sensory awareness helping athletes focus by stimulating the soles of their feet . This is a completely new category Mind Science and likely their response to the healthcomfort trend pioneered by Hoka . 3D Printed Air Max 1000 The limited release of the AM1000 proves that Nike can still lead in technology . Seeing the high premium for the Oat colorway on the secondary market shows that brand heat hasnt disappeared but rather that there was a lack of innovative supply previously . Investor Question CEO Elliott Hill called 2026 a Win Now year . With North American wholesale business showing a 24 % surge in the December 18th earnings report are these new products enough to support building a longterm position below $ 65"

A lot of people responded that they’re not optimistic about INTC and think it can’t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA (NVDA). Admittedly, in some respects, Intel isn’t on the same level as those two companies right now. However, I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value, and today’s rally kind of proved my point. I’ve always felt that a stock’s price movement isn’t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research. So I’m really curious when you’re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in, what aspects do you usually pay attention to? What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock?

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Wishing you all a lot of professional, personal and financial success, and a happy 2026. Influenced by some Reddit users here, I recently started using GetQuin (free version). However, I must admit I find the platform quite complex. I first tried to manually recreate my three stock portfolios, which were built over the course of this year starting from an initial deposit. After that, I imported my transactions from XTB, which actually worked fine. That said, I noticed that the results were not offset against the initial portfolio balance and instead seemed to duplicate the values, which left me a bit confused. Overall, I got the feeling that the platform largely exceeds my actual needs. What I’m looking for is something simpler, excluding Google Finance / Yahoo Finance (and similar tools), that allows me to: Track the performance of each of my portfolios (stocks, fixed-term deposits, and investment funds) And, in particular: Access detailed information on each individual stock Analyse my portfolio by sector and currency Track dividends, namely: payment dates ex-dividend dates expected/forecast dividends For dividend tracking specifically, I was considering starting to use Track Your Dividends, but ideally I’d like to have everything consolidated in a single platform. Do you have any recommendations for platforms that offer both a mobile app and a browser version, preferably free? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Wishing you all a lot of professional personal and financial success and a happy 2026 . Influenced by some Reddit users here I recently started using GetQuin free version . However I must admit I find the platform quite complex . I first tried to manually recreate my three stock portfolios which were built over the course of this year starting from an initial deposit . After that I imported my transactions from XTB which actually worked fine . That said I noticed that the results were not_offset against the initial portfolio balance and instead seemed to duplicate the values which left me a bit confused . Overall I got the feeling that the platform largely exceeds my actual needs . What I ’ m looking for is something simpler excluding Google Finance Yahoo Finance and similar tools that allows me to Track the performance of each of my portfolios stocks fixedterm deposits and investment funds And in particular Access detailed information on each individual stock Analyse my portfolio by sector and currency Track dividends namely payment dates exdividend dates expectedforecast dividends For dividend tracking specifically I was considering starting to use Track Your Dividends but ideally I ’ d like to have everything consolidated in a single platform . Do you have any recommendations for platforms that offer both a mobile app and a browser version preferably free Thanks in advance"

      "title": "Long Live The Oracle: Warren Buffett's last day as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway tomorrow",
      "selftext": "In 1964, Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway at $7.50 per share, which means that at roughly $756,000 per share (Class A common), it has grown its market price at roughly 20% compounded annually, approximately double the CAGR of the S&P index over the same period. EDIT: Perhaps more impressive is that, using data tracked through 2018, Berkshire's per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7% annualized. No other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years. Buffett changed my life in two ways: First, his 1984 article in Hermes, the Columbia Business School paper, \"[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville](\" introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd, and completely changed my capital allocation/investment management strategy. Second, [this talk]( given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates, specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity. I am confident in Greg Abel's abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders' ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Graham's four key criteria, which I can recite from memory to this day: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*",

      "selftext_processed": "In 1964 Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway at $ 7.50 per share which means that at roughly $ 756000 per share Class A common it has grown its market price at roughly 20 % compounded annually approximately double the CAGR of the SP index over the same period . EDIT Perhaps more impressive is that using data tracked through 2018 Berkshires per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7 % annualized . No_other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years . Buffett changed my life in two ways First his 1984 article in Hermes the Columbia Business School paper The Superinvestors of GrahamandDoddsville introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd and completely changed my capital allocationinvestment management strategy . Second this talk given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity . I am confident in Greg Abels abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Grahams four key criteria which I can recite from memory to this day An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return . Operations not_meeting these requirements are speculative ."

      "title": "Coupang $CPNG is Big Fuk",
      "selftext": "Disclaimer: This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate. Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes. TL;DR: CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today. At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem. That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it. On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist. This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart. Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it. This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories. It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure. Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways. U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle. Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. That disconnect is the thesis.

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate . Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes . TLDR CPNG only trades in the U.S. but the crisis is entirely in Korea lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension the public is actively boycotting and this is a newly profitable logisticsheavy business that can not survive disruption . U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis not_a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today . At the National Assembly hearing lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it ’ s framed in U.S. outlets . Domestically investigators are disputing Coupang ’ s disclosures challenging sworn testimony and raising perjury accusations . Internationally it ’ s still framed as a data breach plus compensation . Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem . That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S . The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE . There is no_Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage no_local shareholder pressure and no_market release valve . All price discovery happens in the U.S. while all political regulatory and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea . Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it . On the ground public reaction is not_abstract . Lawmakers civic groups and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension not_just fines or apologies . Korean media coverage has shifted from “ breach response ” to “ whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form. ” At the consumer level largescale boycott behavior “ 탈팡 ” is observable with appusage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share . In Korea boycotts are not_symbolic — people actually leave platforms especially when alternatives exist . This is existential for Coupang because of its structure . The company only recently became profitable after years of losses . It is a logisticsheavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume dense routing and habitdriven repeat usage . A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability . Drivers leave . Sellers leave . Customers retrain behavior . This is not_a business you can pause and restart . Two weeks ago Coupang installed a U.S.trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis . Domestically that has been widely interpreted as insulating decisionmakers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability . That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it . This is why this trade is no_longer about valuation multiples or growth trajectories . It ’ s about whether a newly profitable logisticsdependent company — openly boycotted politically isolated under criminal scrutiny and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure . Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways . U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle . Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . That disconnect is the thesis .

      "selftext": "The U.S. Department of Energy expects to announce **by December 31** which companies will be selected to receive approximately 19.7 metric tons of surplus Cold War–era plutonium for use as nuclear reactor fuel. The initiative follows a May executive order that prioritizes repurposing surplus plutonium for advanced reactor applications rather than diluting and disposing of it. Companies must apply by November 21, and selected participants would receive the material at low or no cost while funding the processing and fabrication required to convert it into usable fuel. Supporters view the effort as an opportunity to strengthen domestic nuclear fuel supply chains, make productive use of existing materials, and support next-generation reactor deployment.",

The initiative follows a May executive order that prioritizes repurposing surplus plutonium for advanced reactor applications rather than diluting and disposing of it . Companies must apply by November 21 and selected participants would receive the material at low or no_cost while funding the processing and fabrication required to convert it into usable fuel . Supporters view the effort as an opportunity to strengthen domestic nuclear fuel supply chains make productive use of existing materials and support nextgeneration reactor deployment ."

Starlink is already a cash-cow and their moat in launch tech is untouchable. But at $1.5T, is it priced to perfection? We’ve seen what happens to \"hyped\" listings when the macro shifts I'm curious to hear your edge on this: Are you waiting for the IPO to go long, or do you think the private secondary market already sucked out all the alpha? Is Musk’s \"Mars Ambition\" a bullish catalyst or a massive capital drain? Let’s talk shop. Is this the next NVDA or the next big rug pull?",

News can absolutely matter, but reacting to headlines alone often isn’t a repeatable approach because: information is frequently priced quickly, the interpretation (and what’s already expected) matters more than the headline, and results are often dominated by process rather than “having the right info.” Where I’ve seen the biggest difference is having a clear framework that answers: Thesis: what do I believe and what would change my mind? Valuation / expectations: what needs to go right for this price to be justified? Time horizon: is this a 3-month view or a 3 year view? Risk: what’s the downside case and how do I avoid a permanent loss? Position sizing: even if I’m wrong, can I stay in the game? I’m not claiming this is the only way to think about it just sharing a lens that helps me separate noise from signal. Question for the community: When a big news item hits, what determines whether you change your thesis versus do nothing? What’s your decision rule?",

It's clear they believe in the long-term potential, and their actions speak louder than words. Nike’s brand still holds its ground globally, maintaining a leading position in the market. The North American market is showing signs of recovery, and despite a 26% drop in share price, Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world. The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors. With a more attractive valuation, Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity, especially for those who believe in the company’s future growth prospects. The question remains: is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity? Only time will tell, but with insider confidence and global brand strength, it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist.",

The North American market is showing signs of recovery and despite a 26 % drop in share price Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world . The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors . With a more attractive valuation Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity especially for those who believe in the company ’ s future growth prospects . The question remains is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity Only time will tell but with insider confidence and global brand strength it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist ."

      "selftext": "NKE is hovering around $60-$61 today. I've been stuck in this position for a long time (down about 20% year to date), and this stock feels dead completely stagnant. The recently released Q2 earnings report did beat expectations (EPS $0.53 vs. $0.37 forecast), which is somewhat comforting. However, the profit margin guidance and weakness in the Chinese market still look pretty grim. The only reason I haven't sold or done a Cover Call yet is because I saw Tim Cook bought about $3 million worth of shares last week. If insiders like him are adding positions at this price, does that mean the bottom is finally in? Or is this just a classic value trap? While the 2.7% dividend is decent, it doesn't come close to covering the principal loss. Do you believe in the turnaround story for 2026? Or do you think Hoka and On are still stealing their market share? Position: 620 shares, average cost $78. What would you do?",

      "selftext": "Coinbase trades pretty in line with Bitcoin so you can see it’s down in the last year. Bitcoin is EXPECTED to bottom in ‘26, whether it actually does or drags longer is another story. Coinbase is also expanding to tokenized stock trading and also using Kalshi for the prediction markets. While I think those two things help them drive additional earnings, I do think the outlook on crypto (especially BTC) is going to weigh more heavily on how this company performs next year than the added lines of business. At least, that’s how I believe the market will overwhelmingly choose to trade the company on. In other words, my assumption is that the stock trading and prediction markets is a nice sweetener but doesn’t change the story (already would face fiercer competition from Robinhood on stuff like this). So given all of this, coupled with the lower PE, (20x) versus others in the industry and assuming BTC will follow a standard cycle and hit a low in the coming is there really any other reason not to buy sometime in the coming year? Holding for a few years at this point seems like it would yield a decent return",

Bitcoin is EXPECTED to bottom in ‘ 26 whether it actually does or drags longer is another story . Coinbase is also expanding to tokenized stock trading and also using Kalshi for the prediction markets . While I think those two things help them drive additional earnings I do think the outlook on crypto especially BTC is going to weigh more heavily on how this company performs next year than the added lines of business . At least that ’ s how I believe the market will overwhelmingly choose to trade the company on . In other words my assumption is that the stock trading and prediction markets is a nice sweetener but doesn ’ t change the story already would face fiercer competition from Robinhood on stuff like this . So given all of this coupled with the lower PE 20x versus others in the industry and assuming BTC will follow a standard cycle and hit a low in the coming is there really any other reason not_to buy sometime in the coming year Holding for a few years at this point seems like it would yield a decent return"

      "selftext": "Recently, MU has continued to fluctuate within a high-range band. Although volatility has increased, it remains fundamentally strong overall. The market's core logic surrounding it still revolves around: AI memory demand, data center expansion, and tight HBM supply these are indeed genuine long-term drivers. My personal perspective: MU currently exhibits distinct characteristics: Solid fundamental logic, not purely a sentiment-driven narrative Continued support at elevated levels, with no significant capital outflow However, divergence is growing, and sentiment is less one-sided than before Therefore, in my view: It possesses the core of a trend while entering a phase requiring validation. Moving forward, focus should shift to earnings delivery, order momentum, and industry pricing trends rather than relying solely on imagination. For MU today, the question is no longer simply “will it rise?” Rather, it's whether the logic behind its ascent can be sustained. While the trend warrants respect, timing and risk awareness are equally crucial. What's your take? In your view, does MU currently represent trend continuation or over-anticipated expectations?

I’m mainly curious how people here are thinking about AMD going into 2026. On the bullish side, AMD seems to be gaining more traction in data center and AI, and they are still taking market share from Intel. Lisa Su has also built a lot of trust over the years when it comes to execution. On the other hand, the stock has already run up quite a bit and competition in AI, especially from Nvidia, is intense. Valuation is also something I’m not fully sure about at these levels. For those who follow AMD closely, do you think the growth story still has room to play out in 2026? Or do you feel most of the good news is already priced in? Not looking for financial advice, just want to hear different perspectives from long term holders and skeptics. Thanks",

I ’ m mainly curious how people here are thinking about AMD going into 2026 . On the bullish side AMD seems to be gaining more traction in data center and AI and they are still taking market share from Intel . Lisa Su has also built a lot of trust over the years when it comes to execution . On the other hand the stock has already run up quite a bit and competition in AI especially from Nvidia is intense . Valuation is also something I ’ m not_fully sure about at these levels . For those who follow AMD closely do you think the growth story still has room to play out in 2026 Or do you feel most of the good news is already priced in Not_looking for financial advice just want to hear different perspectives from long term holders and skeptics . Thanks"

Its valuation has been all over the place, it’s never reported any meaningful revenue, there are no price targets for it and basically Wall Street doesn’t consider it a serious company. Well, while that may continue to be the case in the future there’s a chance that it might not if the merger with TAE is successful - or am I wrong? The merger is valued at $6 billion in an all-stock deal, both companies’ shareholders get 50% stakes, deal is expected to close mid-2026. How come the stock isn’t trading at a rock solid $10.71? ~ $3 billion. I guess because intrinsic value matters little? When was it ever a meaningful metric for this stock anyway- but if this merger happens then shouldn’t it begin to be? Maybe the stock is on its way back to $10.71 after it initially rallied on the merger news all the way up to $17 but has since dived back to $13. I just found it curious that this isn’t like when a buyout is announced and the stock trades at a rock solid price.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been running a stock trading strategy for the past 4 months and wanted to hear how more experienced people would approach monetizing something like this. The principals are: medium-term trades (avg 20 days), avg 8 concurrent trades, diversified - out of 100 monitored stocks 47 stocks were traded in the 4 month period. Results so far (live trading): * 89 closed trades (1-2 trades a day) * 75% win rate * average trade return +3.1% * profit factor ~5.1 * max drawdown ~1.7% * Sharpe ~3.6. I’m aware that 4 months is not statistically sufficient to claim anything, but given these constraints, I’m curious how experienced traders/investors would think about next steps: continue trading personal capital? (I don't have nearly enough personal wealth, even if this strategy persists - which will double the invested capital each year, the initial capital I can invest right now is way too small to gain something meaningful in the near term). Perhaps trading with leverage can solve this? focus on building a longer live track record? But how much is enough? half a year? a full year? 3 years? By then I might lose the edge I have. position it as research/consulting rather than a trading product? I'm already working on the next iteration monitoring additional companies which will improve performance, but this takes time and effort, and I don't want to wait until it's \"perfect\" rather I'd start now when it's \"good enough\". Also, developing this takes too much time to go along with a full time job, so I need to decide whether to continue developing this or to use the current version as is and abandon any further development. Let me know if you have any critical feedback especially on what you’d want to see before taking something like this seriously. ps - I also add a figure of the capital increase compared to several indices from the last 4 months in the comments.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been running a stock trading strategy for the past 4 months and wanted to hear how more experienced people would approach monetizing something like this . The principals are mediumterm trades avg 20 days avg 8 concurrent trades diversified out of 100 monitored stocks 47 stocks were traded in the 4 month period . Results so far live trading 89 closed trades 12 trades a day 75 % win rate average trade return 3.1 % profit factor 5.1 max drawdown 1.7 % Sharpe 3.6 . I ’ m aware that 4 months is not_statistically sufficient to claim anything but given these constraints I ’ m curious how experienced tradersinvestors would think about next steps continue trading personal capital I dont have nearly enough personal wealth even if this strategy persists which will double the invested capital each year the initial capital I can invest right now is way too small to gain something meaningful in the near term . Perhaps trading with leverage can solve this focus on building a longer live track record But how much is enough half a year a full year 3 years By then I might lose the edge I have . position it as researchconsulting rather than a trading product Im already working on the next iteration monitoring additional companies which will improve performance but this takes time and effort and I dont want to wait until its perfect rather Id start now when its good enough . Also developing this takes too much time to go along with a full time job so I need to decide whether to continue developing this or to use the current version as is and abandon any further development . Let me know if you have any critical feedback especially on what you ’ d want to see before taking something like this seriously . ps I also add a figure of the capital increase compared to several indices from the last 4 months in the comments ."

Took 500 to 90k within a month and ended up losing every penny of it (EDIT: THE LOSS PORN IS NOT ABOUT THE $500, but the 90k I peaked at) and now have pretty much nothing to my name. I still have my tech job, but there’s a pretty high chance I’m gonna get laid off soon even if it hasn’t happened yet. Completely lonely in my personal life with no real friends and a non existent dating life. My entire world is crumbling before me and losing all this money is just the final gut punch. If I could give any advice to anyone out there, just don’t trade options. They will ruin your life. Look, I’m not completely giving up yet even though I’m undoubtedly at a very difficult point, but I hope I’ve been able to prevent someone else from having their life ruined by options. Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy’s soon. EDIT: I know that I technically only lost $500, but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k, actually money that I could’ve withdrawn, before falling back to $0. There is no way to mentally see this as just a $500 loss. Trust me I would not be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $500 to $0. By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $0. EDIT: Yes, I regret that I didn’t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $0, but i guess hindsight is 20/20 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past.",

      "selftext": "I know reddit is evangelical about index investing so before everyone seethes most of my holdings are HSBC FTSE All-World Index Fund Accumulation C (not investment advice) but I am curious about steel-manning active management. I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above, fees, etc. But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include? For example, Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid. Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g. 7% for less volatility or contain bonds or are target-date funds (retirement) so almost by construction will lose to the market but aren't designed for that purpose. Also a lot of funds measure their return as risk-adjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say, an all world index, after accounting for that and fees? The all-world index (and US even more so) is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 - in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management. Holding 10,000 stock in a global market tracker is also not really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter - meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tail-end where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman, but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation %s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100% equity return maximisers against the index net of fees? Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds? Any other considerations?",

I know this sub likes passive investing because of the statement above fees etc . But a question I have always had is what does the above statistic include For example Ben Felix has a video about how the rebalancing of indexes makes you overpay and undersell for IPOs and delistings etc as they are forced by their definition to adjust for those details which is one thing an active manager can avoid . Some funds mandate themselves with targeted returns of e.g . 7 % for less volatility or contain bonds or are targetdate funds retirement so almost by construction will lose to the market but arent designed for that purpose . Also a lot of funds measure their return as riskadjusted rather than purely annualised so net of fees I suppose it is conceivable a number of them would beat say an all world index after accounting for that and fees The allworld index and US even more so is now also heavily weighted to mag 7 in theory if an active manager comes close to that net of fees with a wider distribution of stocks then to me that seems a reasonable diversification argument for active management . Holding 10000 stock in a global market tracker is also not_really true diversification as the weightings of the index would matter meaningful diversification is achieved by reducing the correlation between the holdings except for at the tailend where owning 5 banks is better than 1 because the 1 could be lehman but you would expect an active manager to account for more than that with markowitz optimisation for their allocation % s etc I am curious is there anything anywhere that compares apples to apples of 100 % equity return maximisers against the index net of fees Does the table tilt towards active management the more people invest in indexes as presumably this opens up relative value opportunities for active funds Any other considerations"

      "title": "Conversation on Howard Marks' Memo - \"Is [AI] a Bubble?\"",
      "selftext": "I read Howard Marks' memo addressing the widely discussed \"AI Bubble.\" As a novice, still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI, I found it insightful not because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright, but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in - an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy. *For those that read Marks' memo, curious if you had a different takeaway....* While I believe we are in a bubble, the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a mean-reverting bubble (net negative for the economy) or an inflection bubble (net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns). * Mean-Reverting Bubbles * These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk, offering little or no lasting benefit to productivity or human progress. The capital is misallocated, leverage compounds fragility, and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off. * Example: The subprime mortgage-backed securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. * Inflection Bubbles * These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years. While vast amounts of capital are destroyed, a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy. * Example: The dot-com bubble, which accelerated internet infrastructure, normalized online consumer behavior, funded logistics, warehousing, and software systems long before they were profitable. * Amazon is the perfect example, a company that nearly failed, but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale. **Applying this Framework to the AI Era** Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble, but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered: 1. Who will ultimately be the winners? 1. History is unkind to early entrants. There were once thousands of automobile companies; only a handful survive today. AI will likely follow a similar pattern. 2. Will AI generate profits, and for whom? 1. Today, many AI services reportedly lose money on each query. The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share, and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges. 2. Sam Altman stated: \"We'll build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it.\" 3. Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users? 1. AI is clearly a productive tool, but productivity gains do not automatically translate into profits. Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away? 4. Should we worry about \"circular deals\"? 1. Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s, when fiber-owning companies sold capacity to one another, allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value. 2. Today, (i) OpenAI reportedly committed \\~$1.4T to counterparties despite not yet being profitable, and (ii) Goldman Sachs estimates that \\~15% of Nvidia’s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements. 3. This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine end-demand versus financial engineering. **AI Financing Structures, and Looming Debt Issues** JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure build-out could ultimately cost approx. $5T, while the largest spenders (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Oracle) collectively hold only \\~$350B in cash. This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures. I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “good projects” and is beginning to fund marginal ones. Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership, where they structured an SPV so the debt would not sit on Meta's balance sheet. This shifts accounting risk; however, it does not eliminate economic exposure. The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron, where operating control existed without consolidation, and leverage sat outside the partner company's financials. Debt itself is not inherently problematic, instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with long-term economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature. **Takeaway: Are We in an AI Bubble?** I think it's fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change, but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do, how it will be monetized, or the timeline over which returns actually materialize. As is said, \"history rhymes\" and is often instructive. Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s, yet their stocks fell 97% and 96%, respectively, from peak to trough (period covering late 1920s through early 1930s). While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes, it is important context. Going in favor of AI, is that it already has products with over a billion active users; leading players are established companies with revenue, cash flow, and some profits; and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes. Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today, it is hard to argue AI will not drive real productivity gains and long-term economic benefits. What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested. If we assume \\~$1T in invested capital in AI-related capex and infrastructure, achieving a 20% return requires generating 3-6x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 5-10 year period; not revenue, but distributable cash flow. Once we account for failed projects, overbuilt infrastructure, and the concentration of value among a small number of winners, the burden falls on the winners (assuming Nvidia, Google, and a handful of others) to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous. In short: I believe AI is an inflection bubble, one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity, but also one where many investors will not earn the returns they anticipate, and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises.

      "selftext_processed": "I read Howard Marks memo addressing the widely discussed AI Bubble . As a novice still early in developing a deeper technical understanding of AI I found it insightful not_because it dismisses the idea of a bubble outright but because it reframes what kind of bubble we may be in an important distinction with materially different implications for investors and the broader economy . For those that read Marks memo curious if you had a different takeaway .... While I believe we are in a bubble the more nuanced and critical questions we should ask is whether this is a meanreverting bubble net negative for the economy or an inflection bubble net positive despite poor aggregate investor returns . MeanReverting Bubbles These are financial fads driven by the promise of returns without risk offering little or no_lasting benefit to productivity or human progress . The capital is misallocated leverage compounds fragility and the unwind leaves the real economy worse off . Example The subprime mortgagebacked securities crisis leading up to the 2008 financial crisis . Inflection Bubbles These bubbles compress decades of innovation into a few short years . While vast amounts of capital are destroyed a meaningful portion is still invested in technologies that permanently reshape the economy . Example The dotcom bubble which accelerated internet infrastructure normalized online consumer behavior funded logistics warehousing and software systems long before they were profitable . Amazon is the perfect example a company that nearly failed but who survival relied on the oversaturated capital markets willing to fund years of losses in pursuit of scale . Applying this Framework to the AI Era Marks argues that AI increasingly resembles an inflection bubble but one where many of the most important questions remain unanswered 1. Who will ultimately be the winners 1 . History is unkind to early entrants . There were once thousands of automobile companies only a handful survive today . AI will likely follow a similar pattern . 2 . Will AI generate profits and for whom 1 . Today many AI services reportedly lose money on each query . The open question is whether companies will tolerate sustained losses to gain market share and whether durable pricing power eventually emerges . 2 . Sam Altman stated Well build this sort of generally intelligent system and then ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return from it . 3 . Will AI meaningfully expand margins or revenues for users 1 . AI is clearly a productive tool but productivity gains do not_automatically translate into profits . Will costs savings accrue to companies or be competed away 4 . Should we worry about circular deals 1 . Marks highlights an important historical parallel to the telecom boom of the late 1990s when fiberowning companies sold capacity to one another allowing both sides to report revenue without creating true economic value . 2 . Today i OpenAI reportedly committed $ 1.4T to counterparties despite not_yet being profitable and ii Goldman Sachs estimates that 15 % of Nvidia ’ s future revenue may come from such circular arrangements . 3 . This all raises questions about how much reported growth reflects genuine enddemand versus financial engineering . AI Financing Structures and Looming Debt Issues JPMorgan analysts estimate the AI infrastructure buildout could ultimately cost approx . $ 5T while the largest spenders Microsoft Alphabet Amazon Meta and Oracle collectively hold only $ 350B in cash . This gap has encouraged increasingly aggressive financing structures . I believe we may be approaching a point where credit expansion has exhausted its “ good projects ” and is beginning to fund marginal ones . Meta and Blue Owl notably entered a data center partnership where they structured an SPV so the debt would not_sit on Metas balance sheet . This shifts accounting risk however it does not_eliminate economic exposure . The structure echoes earlier SPV arrangements used by Enron where operating control existed without consolidation and leverage sat outside the partner companys financials . Debt itself is not_inherently problematic instead the risk lies in whether capital is being allocated to projects with longterm economic value and whether lenders have clarity on who bears residual value risk when loans mature . Takeaway Are We in an AI Bubble I think its fair to say that AI will be a source of extraordinary change but most of us have little clarity on what it will ultimately do how it will be monetized or the timeline over which returns actually materialize . As is said history rhymes and is often instructive . Look at how radio and aviation transformed society in the early 1900s yet their stocks fell 97 % and 96 % respectively from peak to trough period covering late 1920s through early 1930s . While these stocks were alongside a broader speculative collapse across nearly all asset classes it is important context . Going in favor of AI is that it already has products with over a billion active users leading players are established companies with revenue cash flow and some profits and valuations remain elevated but are meaningfully below prior bubble extremes . Given the scale and intensity of capital being deployed today it is hard to argue AI will not_drive real productivity gains and longterm economic benefits . What I find far less convincing is the aggregate return on invest capital justifying the capital invested . If we assume $ 1T in invested capital in AIrelated capex and infrastructure achieving a 20 % return requires generating 36x that amount in cumulative gross profit over a 510 year period not_revenue but distributable cash flow . Once we account for failed projects overbuilt infrastructure and the concentration of value among a small number of winners the burden falls on the winners assuming Nvidia Google and a handful of others to generate true economic surplus becomes enormous . In short I believe AI is an inflection bubble one where society benefits from its inventions and productivity but also one where many investors will not_earn the returns they anticipate and where capital discipline will matter far more than technological promises ."

      "selftext": "Opinion: Symbotic’s future growth valuation is not taking into account its 35% stake in Green Box, an AI warehouse as a service business. Currently Symbotic is viewed as a pure play robotics company, simply supplying its AI robotics system to companies such as Walmart and Target. Symbotic’s AI robotics system is the only rival to Amazon’s system, which has been proven to be a game changer and the key to unlocking fast and accurate order fulfilment when 1000s of SKUs are available. If companies want to compete with Amazon, they will need Symbotic’s systems and this is what we are seeing with Walmart, Target and recently Medline. This is already well known and baked into the company valuation, with the company trading at just under 16 x revenue. What I believe is not factored in is the warehouse as a service market and their unique opportunity to capture a huge share of this through Green Box, their joint venture with Soft Bank to provide multi tenant warehousing services fit out with their custom AI robotics systems. Quick maths show that the WaaS market was $12 billion USD growing at 15% per year, giving a value of $25 billion USD in 2028. If Green Box can capture 35% market share (first Green Box locations go live 2026) that is revenue of $3.06 billion. Current robotics sales forecast is $4.16 billion in 2028 (massive >$22 billion back log) so that would be a total revenue of $7.22 billion USD. Multiply by current Market Cap/Revenue ratio of 15.8 and divide by share count and that gives a share value of $189 using just US market alone. Now, if you take this and apply it to the total international WaaS market with an estimated TAM of $2.69 trillion USD in 2030 and estimate that Symbotic can capture just 1%, we get a share price of $256 (assuming it is trading at 10 x revenue) accounting for only $6 billion in revenue from robotic system sales. Obviously this would be way higher so conservatively we could say $300 - $400 per share. I believe massive share dilution is not a huge risk as Soft Bank is financing the Green Box venture. Obviously stock based compensation could be an issue but people said that about PLTR when it was a >$20 stock and now look at it. To be fair I am probably a bit early with my revenue predictions as it take a couple years to build out a Green Box site and start recognising revenue, so I am accumulating shares, but might grab some calls should there be a large drop for end of 2026 when the first revenue from Green Box is recognised.",

      "selftext_processed": "Opinion Symbotic ’ s future growth valuation is not_taking into account its 35 % stake in Green Box an AI warehouse as a service business . Currently Symbotic is viewed as a pure play robotics company simply supplying its AI robotics system to companies such as Walmart and Target . Symbotic ’ s AI robotics system is the only rival to Amazon ’ s system which has been proven to be a game changer and the key to unlocking fast and accurate order fulfilment when 1000s of SKUs are available . If companies want to compete with Amazon they will need Symbotic ’ s systems and this is what we are seeing with Walmart Target and recently Medline . This is already well known and baked into the company valuation with the company trading at just under 16 x revenue . What I believe is not_factored in is the warehouse as a service market and their unique opportunity to capture a huge share of this through Green Box their joint venture with Soft Bank to provide multi tenant warehousing services fit out with their custom AI robotics systems . Quick maths show that the WaaS market was $ 12 billion USD growing at 15 % per year giving a value of $ 25 billion USD in 2028 . If Green Box can capture 35 % market share first Green Box locations go live 2026 that is revenue of $ 3.06 billion . Current robotics sales forecast is $ 4.16 billion in 2028 massive $ 22 billion back log so that would be a total revenue of $ 7.22 billion USD . Multiply by current Market CapRevenue ratio of 15.8 and divide by share count and that gives a share value of $ 189 using just US market alone . Now if you take this and apply it to the total international WaaS market with an estimated TAM of $ 2.69 trillion USD in 2030 and estimate that Symbotic can capture just 1 % we get a share price of $ 256 assuming it is trading at 10 x revenue accounting for only $ 6 billion in revenue from robotic system sales . Obviously this would be way higher so conservatively we could say $ 300 $ 400 per share . I believe massive share dilution is not_a huge risk as Soft Bank is financing the Green Box venture . Obviously stock based compensation could be an issue but people said that about PLTR when it was a $ 20 stock and now look at it . To be fair I am probably a bit early with my revenue predictions as it take a couple years to build out a Green Box site and start recognising revenue so I am accumulating shares but might grab some calls should there be a large drop for end of 2026 when the first revenue from Green Box is recognised ."

      "selftext": "For each post, I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers. Then I cross-referenced it with data from Polygon.io. I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later. Here’s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact: 1 ) The famous U.S. Steel partnership post. It's pretty long [so here's the link.]( Affected ticker: X + 13.48% 2) I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Bill needs no formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country, because they have seen, and many have experienced, his philanthropy firsthand. He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation, and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL. Congratulations Bill! Tickers: FNMA + 5.64% FMCC + 3.70% 3) Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.

I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long so heres the link . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

      "selftext": "I’m a (fairly) young LP at a small fund and I’m torn between two paths for my next chunk of capital. On one side: a very “traditional” PE-style opportunity with solid historical IRR, but zero real consideration for climate/societal impact beyond basic ESG checkboxes. On the other: a longer-horizon vehicle that backs early-stage, impact-focused companies and real assets (think climate infra, circular economy, etc.). The thesis is that solving big systemic problems at scale will drive outsized financial returns over 10–15 years. I genuinely \\*want\\* to believe this, but I’m trying not to drink the Kool‑Aid. For those of you actually allocating to impact / climate / “profit + purpose” strategies: \\- Have your financial returns matched your more conventional investments? \\- Any frameworks or metrics you use to separate real impact from greenwashing? \\- Anything you wish you’d known before committing to this kind of strategy? Would really appreciate brutally honest takes, success/failure stories, books/blogs/pods, or even specific fund structures you think get this balance right.",

On the other a longerhorizon vehicle that backs earlystage impactfocused companies and real assets think climate infra circular economy etc .. The thesis is that solving big systemic problems at scale will drive outsized financial returns over 10–15 years . I genuinely want to believe this but I ’ m trying not_to drink the Kool‑Aid . For those of you actually allocating to impact climate “ profit purpose ” strategies Have your financial returns matched your more conventional investments Any frameworks or metrics you use to separate real impact from greenwashing Anything you wish you ’ d known before committing to this kind of strategy Would really appreciate brutally honest takes successfailure stories booksblogspods or even specific fund structures you think get this balance right ."

Broadcom also appears to have secured meaningful orders from AWS and Microsoft, with strong revenue growth expected by 2027. Citi forecasts that XPUs will grow faster than GPUs by 2027, driven by a smaller base and the acceleration of custom AI chip programs. Some people with a zero-sum mindset might argue this is negative for NVDA or even AMD. But those closer to the industry know that NVIDIA will continue selling every chip, system, and rack it can produce. AVGO and MRVL have also been performing very well, not only in custom ASICs but also across networking and storage. Curious how everyone is positioning in AVGO right now.",

I’ll not be needing or wanting the funds starting from 2030 leading up to 2032 (so 7 year max they’ll be in there for with us withdrawing some in 2030 & 2031) as we are using it for a Lapland & Florida fund for my daughter when she’s older. Is it viable or would a standard Cash ISA account be better?

Without overanalyzing or cherry picking, the simplest historic indicators show that market valuations right now are extremely rich, of the type that always proceeds a major correction.

You never know with someone like Trump at the handle, but it's hard for me to see any major negative catalysts for 2026, aside from 'concerns about valuations'. Maybe a single missed ER by nVidia will cause an unwind, or maybe global liquidity will begin to dry-up as most other OECD nations take more moderate monetary policies and more severe theories about the yen carry-trade show true.

Feels like a few things are stacking up: AI memory demand (HBM / DRAM) still looks very real Last earnings + guidance shifted sentiment hard Once MU cleared resistance, momentum kind of fed on itself That said memory has always been cyclical. And at these levels, valuation isn’t exactly forgiving anymore. I’m not bearish, but I’m also not chasing blindly here. Curious how others are playing MU right now: holding common long-term? trimming / taking profits? selling covered calls? or waiting for the inevitable pullback? Genuinely interested in different perspectives, especially from people who’ve traded MU through past cycles.",

But the stock has taken a beating: * 6 months: -15% * 1 year: -24% * 5 year: -5% The disconnect seems to be around competitive risk and whether Yelp's core business model is actually sustainable. Investors are clearly concerned about how the company fits in as AI becomes more integrated into search and discovery. Google and other search platforms are increasingly showing reviews and recommendations without sending users to Yelp. That's a real threat to their traffic and ad model. That said, fundamentally the company is still executing well. Revenue and profitability are moving in the right direction, margins are healthy, and they're returning cash to shareholders. So it's not like the business is falling apart. The question I'm wrestling with: is the market overreacting to the AI threat, or is there a structural decline coming that the financials haven't fully reflected yet? The valuation seems reasonable if the business model holds, but risky if it doesn't.",

      "selftext": "For each post, I used AI to analyze sentiment and predict relevant tickers. Then I cross-referenced it with data from Polygon.io. I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later. Here’s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact: 1) The famous U.S. Steel partnership post. It's pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links aren't allowed on this sub, [so I'm linking an article talking about it]( There's a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post. Affected ticker: X, + 13.48% 2) I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Bill needs no formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country, because they have seen, and many have experienced, his philanthropy firsthand. He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation, and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL. Congratulations Bill! Tickers: FNMA + 5.64% FMCC + 3.70% 3) Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Tickers: BBABA + 5.03% PDD + 4.94% FXI + 2.55% ASHR + 1.14% UUP + 0.69% 4) There are fake, untrue, and probably illegal rumors and/or statements made by, perhaps, market manipulators or short sellers, that I am interested in selling shares of Truth. THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE. I HAVE NO INTENTION OF SELLING! I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements, and who may have done so in the past, be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities. Truth is an important part of our historic win, and I deeply believe in it. Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Ticker: DJT + 4.18% 5) I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico. It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10,000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States. These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl, and illegal migrants into our Country. We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent, and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and high-level Representatives of Mexico. I look forward to participating in those negotiations, with President Sheinbaum, as we attempt to achieve a “deal” between our two Countries. Ticker: EWW, + 3.40% I’ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon. Let me know if you're intersted in any stats I can pull for you. If more people are interested I’ll do a detailed write-up of the analysis.",

I compared the price 1 minute after the post and then 45 minutes later . Here ’ s the 5 posts with the biggest bullish impact 1 The famous U.S. Steel partnership post . Its pretty long and I wanted to link it but Truth links arent allowed on this sub so Im linking an article talking about it Theres a link to the post in the article if you want to read the post . Affected ticker X 13.48 % 2 I am pleased to announce that Bill Pulte will serve as the next Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Bill needs no_formal introduction to the Great Citizens of our Country because they have seen and many have experienced his philanthropy firsthand . He believes in the incredible potential of our Nation and will help us restore the American Dream FOR ALL . Congratulations Bill Tickers FNMA 5.64 % FMCC 3.70 % 3 Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World ’ s Markets I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125 % effective immediately . At some point hopefully in the near future China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A. and other Countries is no_longer sustainable or acceptable . Conversely and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States including the Departments of Commerce Treasury and the USTR to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade Trade Barriers Tariffs Currency Manipulation and Non Monetary Tariffs and that these Countries have not_at my strong suggestion retaliated in any way shape or form against the United States I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period of 10 % also effective immediately . Thank you for your attention to this matter Tickers BBABA 5.03 % PDD 4.94 % FXI 2.55 % ASHR 1.14 % UUP 0.69 % 4 There are fake untrue and probably illegal rumors andor statements made by perhaps market manipulators or short sellers that I am interested in selling shares of Truth . THOSE RUMORS OR STATEMENTS ARE FALSE . I HAVE NO_INTENTION OF SELLING I hereby request that the people who have set off these fake rumors or statements and who may have done so in the past be immediately investigated by the appropriate authorities . Truth is an important part of our historic win and I deeply believe in it . Thank you for your attention to this matter . MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Ticker DJT 4.18 % 5 I just spoke with President Claudia Sheinbaum of Mexico . It was a very friendly conversation wherein she agreed to immediately supply 10000 Mexican Soldiers on the Border separating Mexico and the United States . These soldiers will be specifically designated to stop the flow of fentanyl and illegal migrants into our Country . We further agreed to immediately pause the anticipated tariffs for a one month period during which we will have negotiations headed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio Secretary of Treasury Scott Bessent and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick and highlevel Representatives of Mexico . I look forward to participating in those negotiations with President Sheinbaum as we attempt to achieve a “ deal ” between our two Countries . Ticker EWW 3.40 % I ’ ll post the top 5 bearish posts soon . Let me know if youre intersted in any stats I can pull for you . If more people are interested I ’ ll do a detailed writeup of the analysis ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, so, I am an idiot. a real big one, life-changing, dumb decisions type of idiot. If you spoke with me on October 1st, I was a legend. turned 80k to 220k+ in investments. Speak with me now, and you'll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k+ into 70k. How I got there: Google calls, Soxl calls, UNH calls, Path calls. How I got to where I am now: Iren, CIFR, DGXX. What a fool I am lol wow. It happened quickly and slowly. Didn't realize how heavily I was invested in one sector. Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR. Not just my cash tho, margin too. Then the landslide happened. Wow, did I get fucked. Some bouncing around happened, had some up days, but over the past 2 months, it has been a mental deterioration. Kept throwing in more cash on every dip. So, ya, I fucked up, been rather depressed lately. I was not conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money. I saw a 5% dip, and that was 12k, felt the need to micromanage my positions. bought and sold like crazy. SO what am I doing now? I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler, gambling my life away. It is true **I did gamble**, but that stops here. What I have done: Sold 70% of equity positions and 100% of my option contracts. Bought mainly VOO, and a small bit of QQQI, SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure. This was my first real year of investing, a rough year mentally. Having trouble finding any motivation anymore. But I can't afford that. This is affecting my job performance, marriage, and home life. Constant panic attacks in the evenings, glued to my phone during market open, and glued to futures during market closed. I don't really believe in myself anymore. I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it. Had all my checks and balances and made a killing. But when it mattered most, I threw away my rules and f'd up. It was crazy, one day I checked my port in the morning, it was +3%. By lunch, it was -22%. By the next day, -35%. One more day after, -45%. I literally was in shock watching the red just climb. Since then, death by 1000 cuts. My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing. Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions. Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5% of port. it just sucks I decided to do this now. Not when I had 200k, not 150k, not even at 100k. But now that I have lost so much, I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market. If you read this all, be thankful this isn't you and use this as a reminder to re-read your rules. I never thought this would happen to me, scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice, looking at losses and going ya, no, that will **never be me**. lol life had dif plans. For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar, perhaps not as bad, or worse. What got you back on your feet? It is as if I am wearing red-coloured glasses. Everything just fucking sucks right now, can't find happiness in anything. EDIT: Thanks to everyone who is responding. It is keeping my head on my shoulders. I will keep reading comments and responding. I want this to have a positive effect on someone. Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage. Or someone who is up big right now and doesn't know if they should take profits.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone so I am an idiot . a real big one lifechanging dumb decisions type of idiot . If you spoke with me on October 1st I was a legend . turned 80k to 220k in investments . Speak with me now and youll be speaking to a lowlife coward who turned the 220k into 70k . How I got there Google calls Soxl calls UNH calls Path calls . How I got to where I am now Iren CIFR DGXX . What a fool I am lol wow . It happened quickly and slowly . Didnt realize how heavily I was invested in one sector . Most of my holdings were rotated into NBIS IREN and CIFR . Not_just my cash tho margin too . Then the landslide happened . Wow did I get fucked . Some bouncing around happened had some up days but over the past 2 months it has been a mental deterioration . Kept throwing in more cash on every dip . So ya I fucked up been rather depressed lately . I was not_conditioned nor prepared to handle that amount of money . I saw a 5 % dip and that was 12k felt the need to micromanage my positions . bought and sold like crazy . SO what am I doing now I refuse the narrative that I am a gambler gambling my life away . It is true I did gamble but that stops here . What I have done Sold 70 % of equity positions and 100 % of my option contracts . Bought mainly VOO and a small bit of QQQI SPYI for income and BTCI for BTC exposure . This was my first real year of investing a rough year mentally . Having trouble finding any motivation anymore . But I cant afford that . This is affecting my job performance marriage and home life . Constant panic attacks in the evenings glued to my phone during market open and glued to futures during market closed . I dont really believe in myself anymore . I spent years studying investing before seriously doing it . Had all my checks and balances and made a killing . But when it mattered most I threw away my rules and fd up . It was crazy one day I checked my port in the morning it was 3 % . By lunch it was 22 % . By the next day 35 % . One more day after 45 % . I literally was in shock watching the red just climb . Since then death by 1000 cuts . My current plan is to take a chill pill with investing . Focus solely on indexes with regular contributions . Then perhaps get back into stock picking with like 5 % of port . it just sucks I decided to do this now . Not_when I had 200k not_150k not_even at 100k . But now that I have lost so much I am pulling out of any chance to beat the market . If you read this all be thankful this isnt you and use this as a reminder to reread your rules . I never_thought this would happen to me scrolled x and reddit for years with my carefully curated portfolio offering advice looking at losses and going ya no_that will never be me . lol life had dif plans . For you experienced investors who may have gone through something similar perhaps not_as bad or worse . What got you back on your feet It is as if I am wearing redcoloured glasses . Everything just fucking sucks right now cant find happiness in anything . EDIT Thanks to everyone who is responding . It is keeping my head on my shoulders . I will keep reading comments and responding . I want this to have a positive effect on someone . Maybe a youngin who is thinking of options and leverage . Or someone who is up big right now and doesnt know if they should take profits ."

      "selftext": "I want to share some analysis I’ve been thinking about. I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts. This is for discussion and research purposes only. # 1. Burry’s Thesis Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io]( This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com]( He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com]( and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit). The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position. # 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org]( The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org]( Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD. # 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth]( giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200]( (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price. [Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024]( with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments. The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly. # 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs: |Phase|CPU Generation|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers| |2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention| |3|Milan|Default choice for workloads| |4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share| This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs. # 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation. * NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales * Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace * Refresh cycles could stretch * Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash. # 6. Signals to Watch * MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 * Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale * ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration * NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates. # 7. Bottom Line * NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next. * Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact. * The AI shift is gradual and structural. * If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape. This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*",

      "selftext_processed": "I want to share some analysis I ’ ve been thinking about . I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts . This is for discussion and research purposes only . 1 . Burry ’ s Thesis Michael Burry ’ s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated . Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years en.bloomingbit.io This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality . Burry estimates this mismatch could total $ 176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 investing.com He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dotcom era sahmcapital.com and is using longdated puts expiring in 2027 reddit . The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real . But Burry may underestimate AMD ’ s strategic position . 2 . How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA ’ s AI dominance was not_planned from day one . CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for generalpurpose computing not_AI . Ian Buck a Stanford CS PhD experimented with GPUs for nongraphics workloads . His project Brook became the foundation for CUDA en.wikipedia.org The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers . Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude en.wikipedia.org Key takeaway NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company . That “ stumble ” created their early dominance but nothing_guarantees the next discovery will not_favor AMD . 3 . AMD ’ s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with 192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TBs bandwidth giving it a 36 % memory advantage over NVIDIAs H200 141GB HBM3e 4.8 TBs . Cost is approximately $ 1014k per MI300X versus $ 4044k for H200 roughly one quarter of NVIDIAs price . Microsoft Meta Oracle and TensorWave deployed 327000 MI300X units in 2024 with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services . This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale not_experimental deployments . The main constraint is ROCm software maturity . Historical precedent suggests this is temporary CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance . If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings AMDs hardware advantage could scale rapidly . 4 . EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical generationovergeneration growth in server CPUs PhaseCPU GenerationResult 1NaplesReentry into data centers 2RomeCompetitive performance and cost gains attention 3MilanDefault choice for workloads 4GenoaTurinDominant market share This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally . The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs . 5 . The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not_bursting . That implies sudden collapse . What I see is a gradual rotation . NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace Refresh cycles could stretch Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no_expectation of panic selling . Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold . Burry ’ s longdated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash . 6 . Signals to Watch MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates . 7 . Bottom Line NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company . AMD could be next . Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch but he underestimates AMDs potential impact . The AI shift is gradual and structural . If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape . This analysis is based on research and historical patterns . History is repeating itself and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA just like they did with Intel ."

Znyth Z3 Systems are best suited for AI/Hyperscale BESS, Long duration back up. The product is not thermal heavy, does not require cooling( massive cost saving/development). Longer life cycle(further cost saving). 1/4 of $EOSE pipeline is tied to data centers, best fast response alternative to outdated diesel generators and more cost efficient. Grid support is superior to volatile AI power demands. EoS Energy batteries are best suited for Mid/longer duration, not short burst, lithium power is more suitable but we will get to it in the verdict. $EOSE : 11.40 **Shares Float** : 317M **Short Float** : 26% **Short Ratio** : 3.60 **Insider Own** : 2.3% 🚩 **Inst Own** : 49% ___ **Q1 2025** : Expectation: Revenue ~**$10.4M**; - Actual: Revenue **$10.5M** **Q2 2025** : Expectation: Revenue **$24.1M** , - Actual: Revenue **$15.2M** (non-cash) **Q3 2025** : Expectation: Revenue **$39.6M** - Actual: Revenue **$30.5M**(non-cash) **Q4 2025** : Production & Delivery Ramp, Strong revenue is expected (trust me bro). It’s worth mentioning at this point that the issue with revenue is not the demand, demand is unlimited. Productivity will dictate success here, how fast can company produce the product and have it on the shelf for delivery. The possibility for upside here is massive. **2026 Catalysts / Developments** : **Q4/FY2025 Earnings Report**: late February 2026, key updates on ramp execution, margins, and initial 2026 outlook. **Line 2 Production Start**: H2 2026; enables multi-GWh capacity expansion. **Major Order Announcements**: High anticipation for hyperscaler/utility deals from ~$22.6B pipeline and ~$644M backlog. **Jan 1 2026** : Section 301 - Lithium Ion Batteries tariffs from China to increase from 7% to 25%(Big), : #:~:text=United%20States%20Finalizes%20Section%20301%20Tariff%20Increases%20on%20Imports%20from%20China,-Alert&text=On%20September%2013%2C%202024%2C%20the,and%20finalize%20the%20tariff%20lists.&text=Tariffs%20on%20semiconductors%2C%20respirators%20and,soon%20issue%20a%20separate%20notice. China controls 80% of lithium supply chain, $EOSE mitigates that with different technology. We see rapid growth in numbers of AI/Datacenter. The rising power demands, and the need for power technology will rise with it. I strongly believe EoS Energy has positioned itself in forefront of demand and it’s only a matter of time.

      "selftext": "In 2026, who will lead the next wave of AI? The answer may lie within the optical communications sector. As GPUs and ASICs undergo rapid upgrades and iterations, the marginal gains in computing power are increasingly constrained by the physical limits of network bandwidth. The widening gap between computing power and transport capacity is shifting the industry's focus toward interconnect technologies. The market's underlying logic may shift from purely purchasing computing power to acquiring transport capacity. In this transition, the strategic importance of optical communications could undergo a revaluation, emerging as a critical variable that cannot be overlooked in the latter half of the AI era. If the past two years were dominated by GPUs, 2026 will officially usher in an era driven by both computing power and transport capacity. From SemiAnalysis's optical supercycle thesis to the industry chain's three-dimensional expansion Scale Out, Scale Across, and Scale Up all validate a fundamental truth: optical communication is no longer a peripheral accessory for data centers, but the bottleneck determining the upper limit of AI cluster performance.

      "selftext": "I got into the stock market back in 2019. At first, I was only putting in small amounts. After getting stuck in a few losing positions, I kept averaging down and eventually worked my way back to breakeven. By 2020, I didn’t just recover I actually made over 50 grand. Honestly, if the story ended right there, that would’ve been perfect But once I tasted those speculative gains, I lost control. I got way too confident, almost reckless. I threw every dollar I’d saved over six years of working into the market, and I even borrowed just about everything I could. All in, it was over 500k Around November 2021, I went all in on NVDA. In my head, I was already imagining the stock ripping higher, selling near the top, and finally living the good life. Instead, I walked straight into the darkest stretch. The stock just kept getting hammered, all the way down to around 13. Six years of savings slowly disappeared right in front of me. After a small bounce, I finally called it and walked away Now the stock’s way above where I ever hoped it would be back then but it doesn’t belong to who I was at the time protocol. I’ve since paid off all my debt, and I’m still active in the market today I’m not sharing this for sympathy. I’m sharing it as a warning to anyone gearing up to go big in the market: don’t trade blind, and don’t let your ego take over. You need a real plan and real risk management. Don’t chase overnight riches Make money within your level of understanding, not beyond it",

      "selftext_processed": "I got into the stock market back in 2019 . At first I was only putting in small amounts . After getting stuck in a few losing positions I kept averaging down and eventually worked my way back to breakeven . By 2020 I didn ’ t just recover I actually made over 50 grand . Honestly if the story ended right there that would ’ ve been perfect But once I tasted those speculative gains I lost control . I got way too confident almost reckless . I threw every dollar I ’ d saved over six years of working into the market and I even borrowed just about everything I could . All in it was over 500k Around November 2021 I went all in on NVDA . In my head I was already imagining the stock ripping higher selling near the top and finally living the good life . Instead I walked straight into the darkest stretch . The stock just kept getting hammered all the way down to around 13 . Six years of savings slowly disappeared right in front of me . After a small bounce I finally called it and walked away Now the stock ’ s way above where I ever hoped it would be back then but it doesn ’ t belong to who I was at the time protocol . I ’ ve since paid off all my debt and I ’ m still active in the market today I ’ m not_sharing this for sympathy . I ’ m sharing it as a warning to anyone gearing up to go big in the market don ’ t trade blind and don ’ t let your ego take over . You need a real plan and real risk management . Don ’ t chase overnight riches Make money within your level of understanding not_beyond it"

      "selftext": "MU has been strong recently and the move has clearly been driven by improving fundamentals rather than just sentiment. From what we’ve seen so far Micron appears to be benefiting meaningfully from AI related memory demand particularly around HBM. The progress on HBM3E and early HBM4 sampling suggests MU may be executing well relative to peers especially in terms of timing and customer adoption. That said it’s still a competitive and capital intensive industry. Valuation is where opinions seem to diverge. On one hand the stock is trading near all time highs which naturally raises questions about how much future growth is already priced in. On the other hand earnings growth expectations have increased materially as AI demand ramps and capacity tightens. If that demand proves durable the current premium could be justified by forward earnings rather than short term momentum. What I’m still trying to assess is whether MU is genuinely shifting away from being viewed primarily as a cyclical memory stock and toward a more structural AI growth story or if it remains cyclical at its core with AI simply amplifying the upcycle. I currently hold MU so I’m interested in how others especially long term holders are thinking about this transition and how they’re framing risk and upside from here.",

      "selftext": "so i just saw that nvidia completed a $5 billion stock purchase in intel. this is wild because these two have been competitors for decades and now nvidia is literally a shareholder in intel. i work in tech (software dev in malaysia, been following chip sector closely because of all the ai infra projects ive been building on). this deal has me scratching my head from an investment perspective. on one hand, this could be nvidia hedging their supply chain risk. intel has fabs, nvidia needs capacity, and with tsmc geopolitical risks this makes some strategic sense. but on the other hand, why would jensen huang want to prop up a competitor? what really gets me is the timing. intel stock has been beaten down, theyre struggling with their roadmap, pat gelsinger just left, and now nvidia swoops in with $5b. is this a vote of confidence in intels foundry business? or is nvidia positioning for some kind of deeper partnership or acquisition down the line? for those holding intc, does this change your thesis? and for nvda holders, does this seem like capital that couldve been better deployed elsewhere? my concern is that this signals nvidia sees the chip industry consolidating in ways that might compress margins industry wide. or maybe im overthinking it and its just smart portfolio diversification by nvidia. curious what you all think. is this bullish for both stocks, or is there a hidden risk here im not seeing? disclosure: no positions in either currently but been watching both closely",

      "title": "TSMC Officially Launches Mass Production of 2nm Process + Stock Logic and Future Outlook",
      "selftext": "Just saw the latest official technology roadmap update: TSMC 2nm chip process (N2) has commenced mass production as scheduled in Q4 2025, a timeline explicitly stated on their website. Following the 3nm node, this marks a crucial milestone in TSMC process evolution as it truly enters the GAA transistor era. Market reports indicate that 2nm process capacity is largely booked through late 2026, with Apple reportedly securing a significant portion (roughly half or more) of the initial production volume. Additional major clients may follow. Over recent months, TSMC stock price has demonstrated steady performance amid the global semiconductor recovery amplified by AI and smart device demand. With the confirmation of 2nm mass production, the market is further amplifying the company's technological leadership advantage. TSMC confirmation of 2nm N2 mass production (Q4 2025) solidifies its leading pace in global process technology competition. This may not represent a future development but rather an ongoing technological transformation. How significant do you believe the impact of 2nm mass production will be on TSMC valuation? Is this a “confirmation of future growth,” or has the market already priced it in? What implications does this hold for future stock prices? Could factors like capacity cycles, yield rates, or order issues potentially disrupt the timeline?",

      "selftext": "The narrative in AI hardware is undergoing a significant shift. NVIDIA is officially entering the ASIC and inference market through its partnership with Groq, involving about 20 billion dollars in inference machines. This marks a new phase in AI computing NVIDIA is expanding from GPU-dominated training into ASIC dominated inference. What does this mean? Here are some of my guesses GPUs still firmly dominate AI model training. But hyperscale cloud providers and enterprise customers are increasingly leaning toward specialized chips, ASICs, to better control power, depreciation costs, and unit economics, achieving low-latency, cost-effective inference deployments. This does not mean NVIDIA is pessimistic, on the contrary it shows AI spending is diversifying, with funds flowing into multiple chip architectures rather than concentrating on a single winner. ASICs are evolving from a previously niche position to becoming a core necessity for cost efficient inference in the AI stack. Overall, in the thin liquidity environment at year-end, this structural shift in the AI hardware sector is drawing market attention, but short-term price volatility calls for caution. More meaningful trend validation might not come until January 2026. Will NVDA continue to rise and break the 5 trillion mark? What does today's market drop signal? I am already a long-term holder, but will the market shift in2026 and should I continue holding?",

      "selftext_processed": "The narrative in AI hardware is undergoing a significant shift . NVIDIA is officially entering the ASIC and inference market through its partnership with Groq involving about 20 billion dollars in inference machines . This marks a new phase in AI computing NVIDIA is expanding from GPUdominated training into ASIC dominated inference . What does this mean Here are some of my guesses GPUs still firmly dominate AI model training . But hyperscale cloud providers and enterprise customers are increasingly leaning toward specialized chips ASICs to better control power depreciation costs and unit economics achieving lowlatency costeffective inference deployments . This does not_mean NVIDIA is pessimistic on the contrary it shows AI spending is diversifying with funds flowing into multiple chip architectures rather than concentrating on a single winner . ASICs are evolving from a previously niche position to becoming a core necessity for cost efficient inference in the AI stack . Overall in the thin liquidity environment at yearend this structural shift in the AI hardware sector is drawing market attention but shortterm price volatility calls for caution . More meaningful trend validation might not_come until January 2026 . Will NVDA continue to rise and break the 5 trillion mark What does todays market drop signal I am already a longterm holder but will the market shift in2026 and should I continue holding"

I have a long term buy and hold stock from 2003, when I was a baby. Now that I have been saving my money and am able to put it towards stocks, I'm unsure where to start. I don't know if it would be a smart idea to put more money into this account, as I said it is a DRIP account. Would the dividends that are being reinvested be enough money to keep the stock growing or?? Should I just put this money towards opening an IRA?? Again please excuse my vocabulary and lack of knowledge. This all kinda just got put in my lap recently. And I want to figure it out. Anything helps. Thank you.",

I have a long term buy and hold stock from 2003 when I was a baby . Now that I have been saving my money and am able to put it towards stocks Im unsure where to start . I dont know if it would be a smart idea to put more money into this account as I said it is a DRIP account . Would the dividends that are being reinvested be enough money to keep the stock growing or Should I just put this money towards opening an IRA Again please excuse my vocabulary and lack of knowledge . This all kinda just got put in my lap recently . And I want to figure it out . Anything helps . Thank you ."

They run their fully driverless service in Abu Dhabi with Uber. In Europe, WRD secured their approval in Switzerland's Zurich region and the company expanding fleets in Singapore, planning to operate fully driverless in 2026. Most importantly, the company focus on Level 4 autonomy in defined markets. Rather than just concentrating on single one, WeRide is contributing to the broader evolution of autonomous driving industry. WeRide is advancing their vehicles with WePilot 3.0, one-stage, end-to-end ADAS system, developed with Bosc. The system helps the vehicles to see and act, more like human driving behavior in real time. These efforts clearly show how the autonomy market is moving forward in 2016.",

They run their fully driverless service in Abu Dhabi with Uber . In Europe WRD secured their approval in Switzerlands Zurich region and the company expanding fleets in Singapore planning to operate fully driverless in 2026 . Most importantly the company focus on Level 4 autonomy in defined markets . Rather than just concentrating on single one WeRide is contributing to the broader evolution of autonomous driving industry . WeRide is advancing their vehicles with WePilot 3.0 onestage endtoend ADAS system developed with Bosc . The system helps the vehicles to see and act more like human driving behavior in real time . These efforts clearly show how the autonomy market is moving forward in 2016 ."

      "selftext": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\". So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis: The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. The entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. There's two bottlenecks: InP Substrates - \\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc) \\- Optical transceivers (5g, data) \\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military) \\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters) \\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia’s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.) This is a DUOPOLY from \\-AXTI (est. \\~30–35%) \\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%) \\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%) Indium Phosphide (the source material for everything): Vital Materials - 35% AXT - 25% Before, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom. Now they're used for the entire AI buildout. Just to give u an example $AXTI -> $LITE -> $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down. Google would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -> hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls. THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand > supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI. This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. NFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout. I just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout. It's a monopoly in mining -> refining -> substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary. TLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.",

      "selftext_processed": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams . And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for low quality . So heres the more TLDR version of my thesis The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects . The entire AI Growth story ends in 2026 if theres no_InP substrates materials . BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL One Company $ AXTI . Theres two bottlenecks InP Substrates Hyperscaler optics TPU pods etc Optical transceivers 5g data LiDAR robotaxis drones military Optical Modules interconnect clusters Silicon photonics laser dies Nvidia ’ s future copackaged optics and IntelBroadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays . This is a DUOPOLY from AXTI est . 30–35 % Sumitomo est.30 % JX Nippon est . 1015 % Indium Phosphide the source material for everything Vital Materials 35 % AXT 25 % Before this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom . Now theyre used for the entire AI buildout . Just to give u an example $ AXTI $ LITE $ GOOGL TPU . without any of these members the program shuts down . Google would literally pay $ 5B 50 TIMES prices $ 140m TAM from 2024 DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesnt stall because Meta decided to buy them out . And this would only be a like a 34 % added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap . If Meta does it first then Googles TPU program stalls . If Google does it first Microsofts ASIC problem stalls . THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW demand supply by multiple factors preramp AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains . Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI . This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis materials research . Nobodys_posted about this stock here in the past 5 years youre welcome . Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday because theres a low chance this goes from $ 15 to $ 150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026 . I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof . NFI theres a chance China sends this to $ 0 with export controls so dont follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts . But if this goes to $ 0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout . I just thought this could also easily be a $ 7B company given they control 13rd of the worlds entire substrate capacity and then 14th of the worlds entire materials used for AI buildout . Its a monopoly in mining refining substrate production . And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide . I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary . TLDR THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY . FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $ 700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP ."

      "selftext": "Some more stock ideas from the latest issue of Barron’s Magazine. **CRM** Salesforce is highlighted as this week’s stock pick. Salesforce had a bad 2025 and is down more than 20%, but Barron’s thinks this is a bad reaction to the impact of AI on Salesforce’s business. Salesforce may prove to be one of the winners in the AI game with its AgentForce services that are gaining traction with customers. And in the meantime Salesforce’s current services are going gangbusters and both revenue and margins are growing. Profit margins have more than doubled over the last few years. **RDDT** Reddit is growing faster than most social media and customer engagement is double that of its peers. AI is also a tailwind for Reddit’s licensing and ad revenue. Earnings per share are growing by 60-100% this year so analysts from Needham, Truist and Citi are choosing RDDT as a top pick for 2026. **NKE** Nike got two mentions in this week’s magazine. First Barron’s noted Tim Cook’s big $3M open market insider buy of NKE stock as a sign of confidence in a turnaround. And second Nike was also noted as a possible beneficiary of a potential $2000 check being paid out of the OBBBA as a tariff rebate to taxpayers this year. Barron’s posits that retail stocks like Nike stand to benefit the most from this kind of stimulus.",

Salesforce had a bad 2025 and is down more than 20 % but Barron ’ s thinks this is a bad reaction to the impact of AI on Salesforce ’ s business . Salesforce may prove to be one of the winners in the AI game with its AgentForce services that are gaining traction with customers . And in the meantime Salesforce ’ s current services are going gangbusters and both revenue and margins are growing . Profit margins have more than doubled over the last few years . RDDT Reddit is growing faster than most social media and customer engagement is double that of its peers . AI is also a tailwind for Reddit ’ s licensing and ad revenue . Earnings per share are growing by 60100 % this year so analysts from Needham Truist and Citi are choosing RDDT as a top pick for 2026 . NKE Nike got two mentions in this week ’ s magazine . First Barron ’ s noted Tim Cook ’ s big $ 3M open market insider buy of NKE stock as a sign of confidence in a turnaround . And second Nike was also noted as a possible beneficiary of a potential $ 2000 check being paid out of the OBBBA as a tariff rebate to taxpayers this year . Barron ’ s posits that retail stocks like Nike stand to benefit the most from this kind of stimulus ."

Unlike my old app where I had to pay extra or just guess, seeing the order book depth here helps a lot. * Trading Hours: The access to full pre-market (4 AM ET) is excellent. I like being able to react to news before the standard market opens. * charts: The charting is intense. I honestly only use VWAP and RSI, but it’s nice to have a million other indicators available if I ever get smart enough to use them. Cons: * The UI is... A Lot: It’s super cluttered.

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I turned 18 in April. I have a long time horizon (40+ years), and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction. I’m trying to be intentional about account placement, taxes, and risk. Before anyone says anything, I’ve maxed my Roth IRA already, and plan to keep on doing so. I also had roughly 2k in my taxable. **Roth IRA (growth focused):** **• 65% VOO** **• 35% QQQM** My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I’m young. **Taxable account:** **• 60% equal weighted sector growth stocks** **• 30% AVUV (US small cap value)** **• 10% SPYI** The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated. It is approximately 55% technology, 20% healthcare, 10% financials, 5% consumer discretionary, 5% consumer staples, and 5% crypto via a thematic ETF. The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term. This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions, especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds. AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods. SPYI is intentionally kept small. The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow, while reinvesting all distributions for now. I am not trying to market time or trade frequently. This is meant to be a long term, mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing. **Curious to hear thoughts on:** **• Asset location choices** **• The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure** **• Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient** Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

      "selftext": "I’ve seen a lot of information and talking points supporting either side. It’s a complicated question that has to consider a lot variables. Market returns, interests rates, tax implications, housing markets, stock trends, the economy etc. should all be considered. I have a 6.8% interest rate and owe $238k left on my home. I did the math and if I pay an additional $5000 a month, I will have my home paid off by February 2030 or in 4 years. 25 years early and would save $235k+ in interest. Very enticing. I usually invest roughly $5000 into the market a month so this is all possible with my income. So I’m considering letting that sit for least 3 years and either throwing $5000 at VOO or a similar etf and waiting till it hits $238k and sell to payoff the mortgage or just paying the additional $5000 right into my mortgage and handling that separately. There’s no growth but it’s a guaranteed return. any thoughts or considerations are appreciated. I just want to be debt free and happy by 2030… just not quite sure the best route to get there.",

Market returns interests rates tax implications housing markets stock trends the economy etc . should all be considered . I have a 6.8 % interest rate and owe $ 238k left on my home . I did the math and if I pay an additional $ 5000 a month I will have my home paid off by February 2030 or in 4 years . 25 years early and would save $ 235k in interest . Very enticing . I usually invest roughly $ 5000 into the market a month so this is all possible with my income . So I ’ m considering letting that sit for least 3 years and either throwing $ 5000 at VOO or a similar etf and waiting till it hits $ 238k and sell to payoff the mortgage or just paying the additional $ 5000 right into my mortgage and handling that separately . There ’ s no_growth but it ’ s a guaranteed return . any thoughts or considerations are appreciated . I just want to be debt free and happy by 2030… just not_quite sure the best route to get there ."

One thing to note about the timing of the event is that it comes just two months after Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada Jan 5-9 2026. Whatever consumer-facing products NVIDIA has in store (could we finally get a GeForce RTX 50 Super series announcement?) are likely to be detailed on around CES. At GTC in March, the focus will be on the \"next wave of AI innovation.\" \"NVIDIA GTC is the premier global AI conference, where developers, researchers, and business leaders come together to explore the next wave of AI innovation. From physical AI and AI factories to agentic AI and inference, GTC 2026 will showcase the breakthroughs shaping every industry,\" NVIDIA states on its GTC page. For context, NVIDIA laid out its two-year AI roadmap at its GTC event in March of this year with Vera Rubin NVL144 planned for the second half of 2026 and Rubin Ultra NVL576 on track to launch in 2027. NVIDIA also unveiled its its Blackwell RTX Pro to turbocharge AI workstations, servers, and laptops, and trotted out its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU with 288GB of HBM3e memory on a single package. The latter solution paves the way for 20TB of HBM3e on a rack of Blackwell Ultra GB300 aa (such as NVIDIA's GB300 NVL72) and a monstrous 1.1 exaFLOPS of FP4 compute.

My grandad said I should sack off the premium bonds and max out my stocks and shares ISA (£20k limit per year). He has specifically said I should invest in these companies for a longggg hold: \\- HSBC \\- AVIVA \\- Rio Tinto \\- SSE \\- IG group What does everyone think about these stocks specifically? He said I should focus on high dividend paying stock and somewhat avoid indexs due to slow growth (although i dont agree on the avoiding indexs!). I have been investing small sums mostly testing the water and have been doing alright so far and currently have small amounts in amazon, meta, alamos gold, nvidia, microsoft S&P500 and broadcom. Thanks in advance! EDIT: He has shown me his portfolio growth which he tracks very carefully and he has had significant gains over the last 5 years but he is retired and spends a lot of time watching it which is time i dont have!",

My grandad said I should sack off the premium bonds and max out my stocks and shares ISA £20k limit per year . He has specifically said I should invest in these companies for a longggg hold HSBC AVIVA Rio Tinto SSE IG group What does everyone think about these stocks specifically He said I should focus on high dividend paying stock and somewhat avoid indexs due to slow growth although i dont agree on the avoiding indexs . I have been investing small sums mostly testing the water and have been doing alright so far and currently have small amounts in amazon meta alamos gold nvidia microsoft SP500 and broadcom . Thanks in advance EDIT He has shown me his portfolio growth which he tracks very carefully and he has had significant gains over the last 5 years but he is retired and spends a lot of time watching it which is time i dont have"

      "selftext": "Hi, With year-end holidays and low liquidity, I’m wondering how people usually handle adding capital right before / after New Year. I’m considering adding a small amount to a mega-cap, very crowded and to a more speculative one, a small cap. And I hesitate when is the best timing, this is my first new year in the investment. Long-term horizon (5–10 years), not trading. Do you usually: buy immediately if you have conviction, wait until early January once volume normalizes, or split purchases over a few days to reduce short-term noise? Curious how others think about year-end / early-January timing, especially for high-volatility names? Thanks again.",

      "selftext": "Silver has surged so much that one ounce of silver now costs more than a barrel of crude oil, which is historically unusual. This isn’t happening just because oil is cheap; it’s mainly because silver demand has exploded. Global silver production has failed to keep pace with demand, creating severe supply tightness. Most silver is mined as a by-product of other metals, so even at higher prices, supply cannot be increased quickly or easily. At the same time, industrial demand for silver is extremely strong. The metal is heavily used in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, batteries, and AI-related technology. Industrial users are now competing directly with investors for physical silver, further tightening the market. Investment demand has also surged. Many investors are moving into silver as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, while others see it as a leveraged play on gold. Increased buying through ETFs and futures markets has reduced the amount of available silver even further.",

      "selftext": "I want some honest advice on holding this portfolio for 20+ years. My thesis is basically that these larger tech companies will consume their unfair share of value creation over the next decade, especially as AI, Robotics and Space become more established industries. I also think they are safe long term individual holds as I cant see these companies going out of business (even just considering their balance sheets). I can’t convince myself that international or small/mid caps will outperform the top 500 companies in the US long term with what I think is coming from a technology perspective. I know there is risk to this portfolio and I am not that concerned about drawdowns as I should have the income to sustain my lifestyle. My hope is that long term holding of this portfolio will set me up very well into retirement and give me incredible assets to pass down to my future generations. I don’t really have anyone to stress test this thesis with in an educated way so I wanted to post here and see what others think about this. It's worth mentioning that a lot of these holdings are very much \"in the green\" from a cost basis perspective. My plan over the foreseeable future is to continue putting money into retirement accounts up to the max, allocate \\~100K or so towards S&P500 exposure in my investment account per year for as long as I can, and then allocate another 20K investment towards SpaceX when they IPO. I want to let the individual holdings sit for a long time before considering rebalancing or trimming. What am I missing or what do I have wrong? Do I have too much recency bias in my holdings if I intend for them to be long term assets? When I am 50 will this turn me into a multi millionaire or leave me wishing I had more diversity? |Account|**Balance**|**Portfolio** **Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |Robinhood (Tech Stocks + S&P 500)|$328,149|50.13%| |Crypto (Bitcoin)|$133,507|20.40%| |401K (S&P 500)|$120,031|18.34%| |IRA (S&P 500)|$36,496|5.58%| |Roth IRA (S&P 500)|$27,935|4.27%| |HSA (S&P 500)|$7,299|1.12%| |Roth 401K (S&P 500)|$1,161|0.18%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**| |Holding|**Total Balance**|**Portfolio Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |S&P 500|$257,091|39.28%| |Bitcoin|$133,507|20.40%| |Tesla|$44,763|6.84%| |Alphabet|$37,954|5.80%| |Cash|$37,007|5.65%| |NVIDIA|$35,868|5.48%| |Amazon|$24,445|3.73%| |Apple|$23,136|3.53%| |Microsoft|$22,974|3.51%| |Meta|$19,023|2.91%| |TSMC|$18,811|2.87%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**|",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Looking for some advice on my portfolio. I’m 24 and just hit 550k net worth. I have been pretty disciplined so far, saving a lot and mainly investing in VOO with a little bit in other tech but was wondering after passing the 500k milestone given my age if it makes sense to be more risky. Currently my portfolio is as such \\* GOOGL: \\~$120k \\* Other Big Tech (AAPL, AMZN, META): \\~$15k \\* VOO / VFFSX (401k): \\~$400k \\* Cash: \\~$15k Instead of continuing to strictly only invest in S&P 500, I’m considering shifting some of the VOO weight into QQQM for more tech exposure and also investing into more individual plays I actually believe in such as ASTS, RDDT, ONDS, and TE. Is it crazy for to move from this strictly VOO/chill strategy when I’m already on a good trajectory? If I start buying these higher-risk/growth stocks, should I keep that in my taxable brokerage or try to keep it in my Roth/IRA? (Thinking about the tax implications if one of these actually moons). Thanks for any advice!",

I have been pretty disciplined so far saving a lot and mainly investing in VOO with a little bit in other tech but was wondering after passing the 500k milestone given my age if it makes sense to be more risky . Currently my portfolio is as such GOOGL $ 120k Other Big Tech AAPL AMZN META $ 15k VOO VFFSX 401k $ 400k Cash $ 15k Instead of continuing to strictly only invest in SP 500 I ’ m considering shifting some of the VOO weight into QQQM for more tech exposure and also investing into more individual plays I actually believe in such as ASTS RDDT ONDS and TE . Is it crazy for to move from this strictly VOOchill strategy when I ’ m already on a good trajectory If I start buying these higherriskgrowth stocks should I keep that in my taxable brokerage or try to keep it in my RothIRA Thinking about the tax implications if one of these actually moons . Thanks for any advice"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. My portfolio has been very aggressive with 70% QQQM and 30% BTC for the last six years, and it has performed very well. However, now that I’ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about long-term risk, I’m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC. I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing. I’m planning to hold this portfolio long term (30 years). Here’s what I came up with: US (50%) \\- VOO: 20% (Blend) — 99 / 1 / 0 \\- SPMO: 10% (Momentum) — 100 / 0 / 0 \\- XMMO: 10% (Momentum + Size) — 55 / 44 / 0 \\- AVUV: 10% (Value + Size) — 0 / 58 / 42 International Developed (20%) \\- IDMO: 10% (Momentum) — 92 / 5 / 0 \\- AVDV: 10% (Value + Size) — 1 / 44 / 54 International Emerging (20%) \\- AVEM: 10% (Blend) — 62 / 25 / 13 \\- AVES: 10% (Value) — 46 / 32 / 21 Speculative (10%) \\- FBTC: 5% \\- Pre IPO companies: 5% \\* After the dash, I listed size exposure (Large / Mid / Small caps) in percentages. Things I’m unsure about: \\- Should I keep VOO, or move fully into Momentum and Value? \\- Does it make sense to keep XMMO, given that it has the highest expense ratio (0.35%) of all the ETFs listed? \\- Should I replace SPMO and XMMO with a single momentum fund like VFMO with ER 0.13%, which has Large / Mid / Small exposure of 56 / 21 / 22? It defiantly painful to watch how VFMO (combined momentum in small, mid, large) underperform VOO but I guess it is part of factor investment. \\- Should I add AVDE (cap ratio 67 / 24 / 9) to International Developed and split equally between it and IDMO? \\- I feel like AVEM overlaps too much with AVES, but I’m not sure what a better alternative would be. Momentum strategies don’t seem to work well in emerging markets (e.g., EEMO). Another option could be AVEE (size tilt, 0 / 23 / 77). \\- I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value (30%). In theory, Value should be one of the best-performing assets over the long run (30 years). Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value (AVUV)? I still want to have some top companies that not always be in SPMO but presented in VOO. Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not have. \\- I also found multi-factor rotational funds (DYNF, PALC, OMFL) but not sure what to think about them Overall, I feel that while momentum is nice to have, I still want consistent exposure to big tech, so I need to have VOO as well. Any other advice is really appreciated. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone . My portfolio has been very aggressive with 70 % QQQM and 30 % BTC for the last six years and it has performed very well . However now that I ’ ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about longterm risk I ’ m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC . I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing . I ’ m planning to hold this portfolio long term 30 years . Here ’ s what I came up with US 50 % VOO 20 % Blend — 99 1 0 SPMO 10 % Momentum — 100 0 0 XMMO 10 % Momentum Size — 55 44 0 AVUV 10 % Value Size — 0 58 42 International Developed 20 % IDMO 10 % Momentum — 92 5 0 AVDV 10 % Value Size — 1 44 54 International Emerging 20 % AVEM 10 % Blend — 62 25 13 AVES 10 % Value — 46 32 21 Speculative 10 % FBTC 5 % Pre IPO companies 5 % After the dash I listed size exposure Large Mid Small caps in percentages . Things I ’ m unsure about Should I keep VOO or move fully into Momentum and Value Does it make sense to keep XMMO given that it has the highest expense ratio 0.35 % of all the ETFs listed Should I replace SPMO and XMMO with a single momentum fund like VFMO with ER 0.13 % which has Large Mid Small exposure of 56 21 22 It defiantly painful to watch how VFMO combined momentum in small mid large underperform VOO but I guess it is part of factor investment . Should I add AVDE cap ratio 67 24 9 to International Developed and split equally between it and IDMO I feel like AVEM overlaps too much with AVES but I ’ m not_sure what a better alternative would be . Momentum strategies don ’ t seem to work well in emerging markets e.g . EEMO . Another option could be AVEE size tilt 0 23 77 . I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value 30 % . In theory Value should be one of the bestperforming assets over the long run 30 years . Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value AVUV I still want to have some top companies that not_always be in SPMO but presented in VOO . Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not_have . I also found multifactor rotational funds DYNF PALC OMFL but not_sure what to think about them Overall I feel that while momentum is nice to have I still want consistent exposure to big tech so I need to have VOO as well . Any other advice is really appreciated . Thanks"

Created a decent prompt ( I didn't really create it, I told Gemini to create a prompt to evaluate a stock 10Q/10K) and this is the bet I am making - SMH ( VanEck semiconductor ETF) - ROBO ( Robo Global robotics ETF ) - MRVL ( Marvell technology) - NUKZ ( range nuclear Renaissance ETF) - GRID ( Grid infrastructure ETF) - Solona ( crypto I prefer ) Anyways, I have a prompt and did some research in regards to bottleneck positions in specific sectors and then some research on what companies can profit. Most ETFs as you can see but am just looking for your honest opinion",

      "selftext": "Been thinking about this variation on buy-low-sell-high for a while, and wondering if someone here can help. I give as much as I can to various charities and causes. Not rich enough to be in a high tax bracket, but enough that giving tax-efficiently helps. Since I don't have the nerve for stock trading, I'm mostly in boring sector funds and such. So it's rare that I have significantly appreciated assets to give away. I'm wondering if there could be (or already is) a fund with a portfolio whose components swing widely, but on net do no worse than the market. Then the investor can store money there, giving away whatever's made the best gains in any given year, and wait for the rest to go through ups and downs. Does this make sense at all? Is anyone already doing it? . . . OK, either this is a silly, impractical or redundant idea, or I'm expressing it poorly. The motivation: one might be fortunate to be able to donate to a 501(c)(30 or other qualified charity more than the current $108k tax-free limit from savings, payouts, a home sale, whatever. Or one might like to make smaller donations in any given year, but have no highly appreciated assets that could be donated directly, avoiding capital gains. And there are circumstances where one large gift might have much more impact than multiple smaller ones spread over several years. So I'm asking if there is some kind of managed investment portfolio designed for large swings but net general asset preservation with modest growth. Then there would often be some asset with high short-term gains that could be \"harvested\" for tax-efficient donation, while other components are bouncing up and down. No, I'm not any kind of finance expert, or even very interested in money management and investing. But I am committed to giving away most of what I have, to the benefit of a variety of worthy causes, and am seeking ways to do that when it's needed rather than when convenient for me, and as tax-efficiently as possible. Apologies if this is an unworthy question; if so, I'll delete it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been thinking about this variation on buylowsellhigh for a while and wondering if someone here can help . I give as much as I can to various charities and causes . Not_rich enough to be in a high tax bracket but enough that giving taxefficiently helps . Since I dont have the nerve for stock trading Im mostly in boring sector funds and such . So its rare that I have significantly appreciated assets to give away . Im wondering if there could be or already is a fund with a portfolio whose components swing widely but on net do no_worse than the market . Then the investor can store money there giving away whatevers made the best gains in any given year and wait for the rest to go through ups and downs . Does this make sense at all Is anyone already doing it . . . OK either this is a silly impractical or redundant idea or Im expressing it poorly . The motivation one might be fortunate to be able to donate to a 501c30 or other qualified charity more than the current $ 108k taxfree limit from savings payouts a home sale whatever . Or one might like to make smaller donations in any given year but have no_highly appreciated assets that could be donated directly avoiding capital gains . And there are circumstances where one large gift might have much more impact than multiple smaller ones spread over several years . So Im asking if there is some kind of managed investment portfolio designed for large swings but net general asset preservation with modest growth . Then there would often be some asset with high shortterm gains that could be harvested for taxefficient donation while other components are bouncing up and down . No_Im not_any kind of finance expert or even very interested in money management and investing . But I am committed to giving away most of what I have to the benefit of a variety of worthy causes and am seeking ways to do that when its needed rather than when convenient for me and as taxefficiently as possible . Apologies if this is an unworthy question if so Ill delete it ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. Been doing some huge discovery of what I want a 10 year strategy to be. Here is my idea, let me know what You guys think. So say I have 55k. I buy 1000 shares of QQQI at 54.60 Currently a Jan 16 55 call is going for $0.35 or Feb 20 55 call for 0.60 cents. So, I buy the 1000 shares, and I sell covered calls. The covered calls could add about 0.5-0.7% every month. I will not let these calls assign, this is because I want to collect the monthly payout (13.5% yearly paid monthly) every month without a skip. So, if QQQI drifts up, I roll the covered calls forward and up for break even or a small credit. If QQQI goes down I let call expire and sell another one. Reinvesting the monthly payout and the premium from the covered calls back into QQQI will really help this position compound. At the same time, I can sell puts secured by my portfolio, on stocks I want to own. Small Amounts though. I’d be looking for another 0.7-1%/month yield on the portfolio from cash secured puts. I’d then use the put premiums to make positions in equity stocks. The QQQI would be held in tax free accounts the cash secured puts would be sold in my taxable account (Canada) If you are picking up what I am putting down, what is the drawback to this? I am estimating I could get a 25%+ yield as long as I properly manage the secured puts and follow very strict rules on them.",

At the same time I can sell puts secured by my portfolio on stocks I want to own . Small Amounts though . I ’ d be looking for another 0.71 % month yield on the portfolio from cash secured puts . I ’ d then use the put premiums to make positions in equity stocks . The QQQI would be held in tax free accounts the cash secured puts would be sold in my taxable account Canada If you are picking up what I am putting down what is the drawback to this I am estimating I could get a 25 % yield as long as I properly manage the secured puts and follow very strict rules on them ."

      "title": "A lot of the takes on silver miners and silver itself on here are crap. Here’s what’s happening: Silver’s Christmas Miracle",
      "selftext": "What is happening? I want to address the nature of the sharp rise in silver. Some of it is SLV shorts getting liquidated. That is only a smaller part. the main difference between now and what happened with the Hunt brothers is the Shanghai exchange, which isa primarily physical market, compared to the comex or LMBA, which are more paper markets. Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange, whereas comex or LMBA, despite whatever they say, have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real, physical silver bars. There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults. The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper. One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements. That is what killed the Hunt brothers. For a more recent game played, remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME? However, the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up, and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not on margin or for speculation. They need it to make money. Ideally, the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage (for comparison, look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple, even if execution was a challenge). However, if the demand in Shanghai cannot be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York, the spread will persist, as we have seen for the past few days. And it cannot be fixed by lowering the price in the west. That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges, which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle. What happens here? Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price. In a precious metals bull market, silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode. If you are a fool who doesn’t believe in technical analysis, sorry, but you are SOL. The spread between the western and eastern price can widen. In many ways, a $2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $10 spread. AndI don’t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise. It’s a 45 year cup and handle. It’s not going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive, massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels. Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos. But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not following silver: 1. ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed. How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it’s home exchange? Coeur mining maybe? Can’t even think of a second. US just doesn’t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining. 2. ⁠Stocks are different from commodities. Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply. They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios. Sometimes, stocks need to consolidate at resistance. 3. ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $30 strike. 4. ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail, and lots of people don’t understand what is really happening. This is not a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers. This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA cannot make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements. In fact, lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China. Since the average retail investor has no clue what is happening, they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price. Miners don’t make money from spikes. They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time. However, once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China, we will see what they do. I’d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter: If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not being reliable sources of physical silver, and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver (disclaimer: that’s a speculation. I and others believe it to be true but can’t prove it), then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE. What happens then? A side note: silver follows gold. Know what else tends to follow gold? a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL. We (the US) are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $60/barrel. That’s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming, and current prices are not a crisis. Dunno how to spell that out more clearly.",

      "selftext_processed": "What is happening I want to address the nature of the sharp rise in silver . Some of it is SLV shorts getting liquidated . That is only a smaller part . the main difference between now and what happened with the Hunt brothers is the Shanghai exchange which isa primarily physical market compared to the comex or LMBA which are more paper markets . Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange whereas comex or LMBA despite whatever they say have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real physical silver bars . There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults . The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper . One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements . That is what killed the Hunt brothers . For a more recent game played remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME However the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not_on margin or for speculation . They need it to make money . Ideally the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage for comparison look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple even if execution was a challenge . However if the demand in Shanghai can not be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York the spread will persist as we have seen for the past few days . And it can not be fixed by lowering the price in the west . That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle . What happens here Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price . In a precious metals bull market silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode . If you are a fool who doesn ’ t believe in technical analysis sorry but you are SOL . The spread between the western and eastern price can widen . In many ways a $ 2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $ 10 spread . AndI don ’ t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise . It ’ s a 45 year cup and handle . It ’ s not_going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels . Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos . But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not_following silver 1 . ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed . How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it ’ s home exchange Coeur mining maybe Can ’ t even think of a second . US just doesn ’ t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining . 2 . ⁠Stocks are different from commodities . Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply . They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios . Sometimes stocks need to consolidate at resistance . 3 . ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $ 30 strike . 4 . ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail and lots of people don ’ t understand what is really happening . This is not_a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers . This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA can not make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements . In fact lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China . Since the average retail investor has no_clue what is happening they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price . Miners don ’ t make money from spikes . They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time . However once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China we will see what they do . I ’ d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not_being reliable sources of physical silver and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver disclaimer that ’ s a speculation . I and others believe it to be true but can ’ t prove it then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE . What happens then A side note silver follows gold . Know what else tends to follow gold a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL . We the US are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $ 60barrel . That ’ s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming and current prices are not_a crisis . Dunno how to spell that out more clearly ."

      "selftext": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my “bags”. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn’t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. Why am I bullish on oil? Well, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order : 1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row). 2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing. 3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100. 4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1. 5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point. One of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. Here’s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. XOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN Anyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open it wouldn ’ t move it a needle . With that being said I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026 I believe that energy equities could outperform . Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $ 55 crude . Yes an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver . Read that again . Can it go lower Sure . Is it sustainable No_I think in hindsight this will have been obvious . Sometimes things are cheap enough . Why am I bullish on oil Well I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it . I will try to keep this short and concise . In no_particular order 1 . The massive supply glut is overstated and demand is not_as weak as forecasted either . Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 not that IEA has any real credibility . They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row . 2 . Most of the worlds oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale . There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked or is close . Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices contrary to what the Mango man wants their production will not_be growing . 3 . XLE makes up less than 3 % of SPY . Just going back to the historical average of 68 % would imply massive gains for the equities . The bullish case is not_necessairly dependent on crude hitting $ 100 . 4 . Seasonality . Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1 . 5 . Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point . One of my favorite boomers to listen to Rick Rule says that you dont need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities . He thinks XOM is selling at 60 % of NPV meaning at 40 % discount . Im personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant . The Canadian OG stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and Im betting that he will enable them . He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US OG names . Im also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks . Here ’ s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats . XOM CVX COP CNQ SU OXY DVN Anyways thats it for now . Im off to play some poker . See you degens on Monday ."

They had a decent quarter, ARR, Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price. I work in tech nationally. Every company that I talk to (from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet) are switching from VMWare to Nutanix. Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they’re bleeding customers now. The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that’s really only for MS customers who are only MS. This feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?",

I've conceded some gains to mitigate risk, but still see risk compounding everywhere I look, and my tolerance isn't getting any higher. Here's where I'm at: * Emerging 6% * Foreign 25% * Domestic (value) 17% * REITs 12% * Bonds 10% * TIPS 9% * Treasuries 11% * Cash 10% Basically a moderate 65/35 port with a bias toward foreign, value, and cash.

      "title": "Top Quality DD on ETH: High Conviction trade since my last DD on META (hand written not AI)",
      "selftext": "Alright, regards, if you had been following my last DD on META, you would’ve done really well. Since that DD post, my position has been up moderately + I’ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call (I bought back when I’m up 50% and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility). I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits. TLDR: Fundamentally: Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation. BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream (around 2021 to present). I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then. Macro/Policy: The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer. Bullish for commodities. Thesis: Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn’t over yet. Short/Medium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 (according to scott bessent). DD starts here: I’m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas. ETH, some people call it digital silver, some people call it the backbone of Wall Street, some people call it a scam (I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it). Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade, and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately, while others are still amazed at his haircut. All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue - is Ethereum worth anything, or is it just fairy dust? In my DD, I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won’t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium. **What is value?** The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield. Which is why we can value a stock, because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric, gold/silver/BTC/ETH are all the same - they have no intrinsic value as they don’t earn you any money just by holding them. Which leads us to the next question: why are gold and silver doing so well, while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage? **What is price? How are commodities priced?** There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity. The most common factors include: utility, scarcity, trust/credibility, cost to carry, supply and demand, and most importantly market sentiment (mass psychology). For gold and silver specifically, they have limited in supply (on earth) and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not only as commodities but also as currencies. In terms of utility, Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below. However, if you just look at supply vs demand, you would realized they are not off by much and it’s not really the driver for gold price (same for silver). **What is the real driver for price?** As mentioned earlier, gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not just as commodities, but as currencies. So much so that they are considered risk-off assets (or save haven when shit hits the fan). Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks. In other words, gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver. (as shown in chart below) Like the stock market, gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply (aka inflation). On top of that, gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens. Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety. **What about BTC and ETH?** There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver. For example, BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world’s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain (similar to gold, it became a much more volatile version of store of value). And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets (sounds like silver when it comes to utility). The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024. While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions, ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets. So far, 65% of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant, the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030. So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network. While it sounded like a greenflag on paper, I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag. ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH (as projection chart shows below, the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years + ETH gives a dividend), I find this to be shady and don’t really buy it. On top of that, I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price. But if the supply projection holds true, ETH will be much closer to the digital silver. Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies, the correlation between BTC/ETH and M2 says it all. Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021. And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period. So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset? This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal, a FinTech strategist at Autonomous. Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed. In the early years, crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money, so it was less correlated with equities. After COVID, easier access through exchanges, large retail participation, and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios. As a result, BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite, which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold. This does not mean BTC and ETH will always trade like high-beta stocks. As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and long-term holders, their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints, network usage, and monetary demand rather than short-term liquidity cycles. Over time, this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities, where value is tied to money supply, instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment. **The Inflationary Policy & Macro effects** Trump has taken extensive measures (manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed) to keep the USD weak and interest rate low (to maintain export advantage + service the 38 trillion debt) despite high level of inflation. The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury (kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world). The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market. Which could be inflationary. **Short Term Catalyst for ETH: Tokenization** In 2025, the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones, including: * SEC roundtables on tokenization; platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US. * BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs; industry leaders predict massive market growth. * Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026; Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street. And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption. CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network: To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization, the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below. So far, 90% of tokenized assets are stable coin (which ETH dominates) and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network **So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end?** Since late October, the stock market has been choppy rather than trending. Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened, which caused systematic investors like CTAs and vol-targeting funds to reduce exposure. In this environment, BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds, not because of panic, but because risk appetite never fully returned. Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious. So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown. The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into year-end, which suggests sentiment is still intact. Most notably, the AI sector has remained strong. Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding, showing that growth expectations have not collapsed. As equity volatility compresses and risk-on sentiment improves, this gives the market room to grind higher. If that happens, liquidity and positioning should rotate back into high-beta assets, which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026. Looking at the ETH chart, the day candle is showing stabilization and I don’t see why it wouldn’t revisit ATH and break above $5,250 in Q1 2026. **My expression for this bet: BMNR (I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4% at the time of purchase)** As I think ETH could re-visit 5k in Q1 2026, BMNR is the perfect pick. I pick it for 3 reasons: 1. No debt - so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR (which is also starting to price in not being included into S&P 500). 2. Premium to NAV expansion - if my thesis plays out, Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels: 1.3x - 1.5x (which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world). 3. I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear. (for reasons I mentioned earlier, the ETH network is doing great, far from a bear market - so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift). **Position**: I even bought for my TFSA:",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright regards if you had been following my last DD on META you would ’ ve done really well . Since that DD post my position has been up moderately I ’ ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call I bought back when I ’ m up 50 % and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility . I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits . TLDR Fundamentally Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation . BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream around 2021 to present . I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then . MacroPolicy The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer . Bullish for commodities . Thesis Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn ’ t over yet . ShortMedium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 according to scott bessent . DD starts here I ’ m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas . ETH some people call it digital silver some people call it the backbone of Wall Street some people call it a scam I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it . Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately while others are still amazed at his haircut . All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue is Ethereum worth anything or is it just fairy dust In my DD I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won ’ t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium . What is value The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield . Which is why we can value a stock because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric goldsilverBTCETH are all the same they have no_intrinsic value as they don ’ t earn you any money just by holding them . Which leads us to the next question why are gold and silver doing so well while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage What is price How are commodities priced There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity . The most common factors include utility scarcity trustcredibility cost to carry supply and demand and most importantly market sentiment mass psychology . For gold and silver specifically they have limited in supply on earth and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not_only as commodities but also as currencies . In terms of utility Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below . However if you just look at supply vs demand you would realized they are not_off by much and it ’ s not_really the driver for gold price same for silver . What is the real driver for price As mentioned earlier gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not_just as commodities but as currencies . So much so that they are considered riskoff assets or save haven when shit hits the fan . Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks . In other words gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver . as shown in chart below Like the stock market gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply aka inflation . On top of that gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens . Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety . What about BTC and ETH There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver . For example BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world ’ s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain similar to gold it became a much more volatile version of store of value . And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets sounds like silver when it comes to utility . The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024 . While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets . So far 65 % of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030 . So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network . While it sounded like a greenflag on paper I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag . ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH as projection chart shows below the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years ETH gives a dividend I find this to be shady and don ’ t really buy it . On top of that I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price . But if the supply projection holds true ETH will be much closer to the digital silver . Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies the correlation between BTCETH and M2 says it all . Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021 . And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period . So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal a FinTech strategist at Autonomous . Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed . In the early years crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money so it was less correlated with equities . After COVID easier access through exchanges large retail participation and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios . As a result BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold . This does not_mean BTC and ETH will always trade like highbeta stocks . As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and longterm holders their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints network usage and monetary demand rather than shortterm liquidity cycles . Over time this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities where value is tied to money supply instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment . The Inflationary Policy Macro effects Trump has taken extensive measures manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed to keep the USD weak and interest rate low to maintain export advantage service the 38 trillion debt despite high level of inflation . The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world . The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market . Which could be inflationary . Short Term Catalyst for ETH Tokenization In 2025 the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones including SEC roundtables on tokenization platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US . BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs industry leaders predict massive market growth . Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026 Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street . And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption . CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below . So far 90 % of tokenized assets are stable coin which ETH dominates and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end Since late October the stock market has been choppy rather than trending . Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened which caused systematic investors like CTAs and voltargeting funds to reduce exposure . In this environment BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds not_because of panic but because risk appetite never_fully returned . Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious . So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown . The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into yearend which suggests sentiment is still intact . Most notably the AI sector has remained strong . Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding showing that growth expectations have not_collapsed . As equity volatility compresses and riskon sentiment improves this gives the market room to grind higher . If that happens liquidity and positioning should rotate back into highbeta assets which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026 . Looking at the ETH chart the day candle is showing stabilization and I don ’ t see why it wouldn ’ t revisit ATH and break above $ 5250 in Q1 2026 . My expression for this bet BMNR I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4 % at the time of purchase As I think ETH could revisit 5k in Q1 2026 BMNR is the perfect pick . I pick it for 3 reasons 1 . No_debt so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR which is also starting to price in not_being included into SP 500 . 2 . Premium to NAV expansion if my thesis plays out Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels 1.3x 1.5x which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world . 3 . I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear . for reasons I mentioned earlier the ETH network is doing great far from a bear market so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift . Position I even bought for my TFSA"
