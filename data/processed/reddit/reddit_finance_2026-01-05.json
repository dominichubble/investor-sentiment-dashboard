      "selftext": "Football is the most-watched event in the United States. Over the next month, the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape. Last year, seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games. The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each. Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest. Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada. Up until 2018, Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘enjoy’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game. On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). By doing so, it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Today, thirty-eight states permit sports wagering in their areas. Now, another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray. They are called prediction markets. Over the last year, the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports, politics, business, weather, travel, and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption. The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events, and specifically football. Why does this matter for the investment world? Increasingly, the public uses its money to try to make a profit. Traditionally, the investment world was the domain where that took place. Over the last twenty years, as markets have become digitized, custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices, especially smartphones. Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity. If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options, levered ETFs, levered ETFs on single stocks, and ETFs related to any geography or activity, one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are, at the very least, blurring. The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi. Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products. In October of 2025, Polymarket received a $2 billion investment at a $9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide access to prediction products for institutions. Kalshi, the leader in global prediction markets with a 60% share and annual trading volume of over $50 billion, obtained $300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia, Andreesen-Horwitz, A16z, and Paradigm. Interestingly, one of the best-performing stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood, the online broker. When any entity suddenly finds a one-hundred-million-dollar run-rate business in less than a year, especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues, investors react favorably. As the prediction entities have gained adoption, the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically. More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas, the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6% in 2025 (perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026?) Whenever there is a competitive alternative, incumbents will respond to protect their market share. FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association. The following week, both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms (in partnership with the CME Group, the publicly traded futures exchange). Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry. From a regulatory standpoint, the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, it views the product as a financial derivative and not gambling. Anti-fraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘clarify’ the legal boundaries. In Congress, our on-the-ball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members (The ex-madame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember). So how should investors view this whole situation? The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting. However, betting and gambling are different. In gaming, there is a definite outcome, and the only thing one owns is the chance that one’s prediction, wager, hand, throw of the dice, or pull of the machine turns out correctly. When one invests, you own an entity that has assets and liabilities. In most cases, those assets and liabilities form operating businesses. The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity. From my perspective, and I have written this on numerous occasions, my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino. The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges, suppliers of gaming, and some underlying offshoot of both. Yes, Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged. It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and I certainly will be paying attention.",

      "selftext_processed": "Football is the mostwatched event in the United States . Over the next month the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape . Last year seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games . The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each . Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest . Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada . Up until 2018 Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘ enjoy ’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game . On May 14 2018 the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act PASPA . By doing so it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting . Today thirtyeight states permit sports wagering in their areas . Now another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray . They are called prediction markets . Over the last year the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports politics business weather travel and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption . The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events and specifically football . Why does this matter for the investment world Increasingly the public uses its money to try to make a profit . Traditionally the investment world was the domain where that took place . Over the last twenty years as markets have become digitized custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices especially smartphones . Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity . If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options levered ETFs levered ETFs on single stocks and ETFs related to any geography or activity one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are at the very least blurring . The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi . Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products . In October of 2025 Polymarket received a $ 2 billion investment at a $ 9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange ICE to provide access to prediction products for institutions . Kalshi the leader in global prediction markets with a 60 % share and annual trading volume of over $ 50 billion obtained $ 300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia AndreesenHorwitz A16z and Paradigm . Interestingly one of the bestperforming stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood the online broker . When any entity suddenly finds a onehundredmilliondollar runrate business in less than a year especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues investors react favorably . As the prediction entities have gained adoption the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically . More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6 % in 2025 perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026 Whenever there is a competitive alternative incumbents will respond to protect their market share . FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association . The following week both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms in partnership with the CME Group the publicly traded futures exchange . Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry . From a regulatory standpoint the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC . Currently it views the product as a financial derivative and not_gambling . Antifraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘ clarify ’ the legal boundaries . In Congress our ontheball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members The exmadame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember . So how should investors view this whole situation The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting . However betting and gambling are different . In gaming there is a definite outcome and the only thing one owns is the chance that one ’ s prediction wager hand throw of the dice or pull of the machine turns out correctly . When one invests you own an entity that has assets and liabilities . In most cases those assets and liabilities form operating businesses . The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity . From my perspective and I have written this on numerous occasions my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino . The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges suppliers of gaming and some underlying offshoot of both . Yes Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged . It will be interesting to see how this evolves and I certainly will be paying attention ."

      "selftext": "This is my latest summary of stock ideas I drew from this week’s issue of Barron’s Magazine. I didn’t find many specific stock recommendations from the pages because some of the big articles were overviews about dividend paying stocks and international markets, and the official stock pick of Schwab seemed pretty lame to me. **SCHW**. I really cannot endorse this week’s stock pick by Barron’s. It doesn’t make a very good case for investing in Schwab at this time. They point out that Schwab is coming back from a scandal involving paying little to no interest on customer sweep accounts, but the stock was already up 18% in 2025 and the stock is still pretty expensive. The article reads like an advertisement for Schwab, and Schwab is already a big advertiser in Barron’s. Coincidence? **BABA** Alibaba is called out as a stock to buy in the article about international stocks. The case on BABA is based on the outsize earnings growth of international stocks esp emerging markets, their discount to US stock valuations, and China’s ability to go head to head with the US on AI innovation. Alibaba specifically has a full stack of AI assets to lead in AI, a load of cash, and they are the top cloud provider in China. BABA was up 75% in 2025, but still remains at a reasonable PE multiple of 18. **NVDA**. Barron’s cites an analyst report recommending Nvidia as a buy. Specifically the analyst at Mizuho highlights the recent acquisition/license of Groq as a key one that will put Nvidia into a prime position to compete with Alphabet’s TPU on AI inference over the transition period from AI Training to Inference over the coming years. Price target of $245.",

Worst decision ever, now I’m down to about 3.5k and I’m stuck wondering if I should pull it out at a loss and pay off what I can, or just hold. I’m 21 and started investing when I was 19. I bought PLTR, SOFI, NVIDIA, and some other solid stuff around May 2023 and honestly thought I was just a great investor. Then I had to sell at a decent profit to buy a car for college. I started again recently after saving up some money. Normally I just pay off my cards, but I had the “genius” idea to throw it into the market, make a shit ton, and then wipe out the debt and keep the difference. Clearly that didn’t work and the logic was retarded. The fact I could lose so hard in a bull market like this is embarrassing I just went too hard on random stocks and stopped investing started gambling",

Worst decision ever now I ’ m down to about 3.5k and I ’ m stuck wondering if I should pull it out at a loss and pay off what I can or just hold . I ’ m 21 and started investing when I was 19 . I bought PLTR SOFI NVIDIA and some other solid stuff around May 2023 and honestly thought I was just a great investor . Then I had to sell at a decent profit to buy a car for college . I started again recently after saving up some money . Normally I just pay off my cards but I had the “ genius ” idea to throw it into the market make a shit ton and then wipe out the debt and keep the difference . Clearly that didn ’ t work and the logic was retarded . The fact I could lose so hard in a bull market like this is embarrassing I just went too hard on random stocks and stopped investing started gambling"

China will simply buy barrels elsewhere but without the the steep discount they get from Venezuela. Even optimistic estimates regarding Venezuela production increases put any additional barrels above 900k bpd 3 to 5 years out (Jeffries put out a note on this today).

      "selftext": "I had a call option for exxon mobil that I sold last week because my date till expiration was coming up on the 16th and I had already held it for 4 months. I made $75. My call was for a strike price of $120 and I bought it for $300. I sold the option when exxon was at $122. Now, exxon is at $130 and rose over 6%. I would have made $1500 and I'm just trying not to get frustrated with myself over a skyrocket in price that I couldn't have predicted if I tried. How do you guys go about navigating situations like this? I'm 21 and recently got into trading and am still working on separating emotions from the market. To emphasize why this hurts more, my portfolio was only $300. I put my entire account into that one call (it wasn't as risky because I had a 4 month DTE). However, this would have increased my account size by 5x. Aaaahhhhhh Okay thanks guys I think I was just being dramatic. I will recover and catch the next one :)",

      "selftext": "AI is hungry. It needs power, lots of it. But the US power grid is old. It wasn’t built for data centers that drink electricity like water. That’s the bottleneck. Quanta Services (PWR) is the uncorker. They don’t build the AI chips. They don’t run the servers. They build the stuff that powers the stuff. Transmission lines. Substations. Underground cables. If electrons need to move from point A to point B, Quanta builds the road. Why them? Scale. The grid is fragmented. Most repair crews are local mom-and-pops. Quanta is massive. They have the labor force. They have the equipment. They can deploy an army of linemen anywhere in the country. Utilities are panicking. They need to upgrade now. They are boosting spending by 25-30% over the next three years. They can’t do it alone. They call Quanta. The proof is in the backlog. They have nearly \\~$40B in signed contracts. That’s not “maybe” money. That’s “we are doing this” money. The numbers (Q3 2025)... Market cap: \\~$64B Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year) Adjusted EPS: $3.33 52-week high: \\~$469 52-week low: \\~$227 The risks... It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too. Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down. Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do. Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why? Dan from Money Machine Newsletter",

Microsoft - 9$ 6. Visa - 9$ 7. Palantir - 8$ 8.Microstrategy - 5$ 9. Nividia - 5$ 10. ASML - 5$ 11. VTI - 5$ 12. CIBR - 5$ 13. Cash - 12$ Total allocated weekly 113$ with 12$ cash reserve (roughly 10%) I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school. With that pause I had 2,750$ left over for the 2025 fiscal year. I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row! Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year. My plan is listed below: I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2,750 total “extra” contributions 250$ cash reserve 2,500$ stocks 2,500 / 26 =96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1. Tesla 2. SCHG 3. Microsoft 4. Microstrategy 5. VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money? I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion. Personally with those 5 plays I would add (EXTRA) 1. 25$ to Tesla 2. 20$ to SCHG 3. 20$ to Microsoft 4. 15$ to Microstrategy 5. 16$ to VTI Or something like that. What’s the move chat?",

      "selftext": "Lots of people are talking about oil companies and oil infrastructure companies like CVX, XOM, COP and HAL. We saw some relatively large moves on Friday from these companies potentially foreshadowing the beginning of the Venezuelan Op over the weekend. Potentially more movements to come as the market prices in more US involvement in their oil industry. One trade that is not so obvious and I’m not sure has been considered is Venezuelan currency. With the oil fields opening up and US investment moving in there is going to be a huge increase in the velocity of money. Wages need to be paid, materials need to be purchased etc. How do you think this will be paid for? Bolivar, USD, Stable Coins, Crypto, Ornamental Gourds, Other? You could kind of make a case for any of them",

      "selftext": "The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per) During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?” Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen",

      "selftext_processed": "The year was 2015 . I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school . The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers . I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k . I remember buying Macys Hecla Mining and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better . I was over trading like a mad man . This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7 $ per trade during those days . Just young and dumb not_really making any money . Wasting company time so no_harm no_foul . In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k . Which was basically my life savings at that point in time . I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia . Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes . A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary yes even at that time . I found his aspirations of self driving AI robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape . I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk . I remember talking to my father in law about it . “ What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia ” Too many eggs in one basket was his response . I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia . As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could . $ 200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares . It has been a great ride since then . There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares . It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long . So much bullshit Crypto winter Andrew Left short selling attacks Covid selloffs deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day . I ’ m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house cars investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA . Trading and more specifically Nvidia changed my entire life . Proudly riding with Jensen"

      "selftext": "Ok, I want to preface with this being speculation but I believe snap to be a highly undervalued company in the age of information technology as such a overvalued sector, (only software stock still held across all portfolios ) mostly due to there new charging for data addition, the old geezers on wall street seem to think this will deter people from using the app and while that may happen to an extent, the vast majority of people will think , eh 2$ to save my data is more than worth it and even if they want to save it for a month to buy a physical drive will proably forget after, they have 900 million users. If even 10% of people buy it that is a 50% increase in revenue per quarter. (90M\\*1.99 \\* 3 =537.3 ) currently making 1.3B per quarter. But this comes at ZERO additional investment to them. Even without this change there current valuation is a joke. Please tell me if I’m wrong and argue with me before I yolo another 5 grand",

If even 10 % of people buy it that is a 50 % increase in revenue per quarter . 90M1.99 3 537.3 currently making 1.3B per quarter . But this comes at ZERO additional investment to them . Even without this change there current valuation is a joke . Please tell me if I ’ m wrong and argue with me before I yolo another 5 grand"

USA will control Venezuela so Chevron might go big too, I have no idea I still searching for some info how petrol barrels work and their economy.

USA will control Venezuela so Chevron might go big too I have no_idea I still searching for some info how petrol barrels work and their economy . Saudi wants to control the eintermening industry so Ubisoft is cheap at the moment eventually the french family that owns it will sell their soul to the Saudis or maybe who knows to the Chinese and I can make some profit from that .

      "title": "[UPDATE] $GT Goodyear Tires: Maduro's Capture Stock Analysis",
      "selftext": "[**Initial DD here**]( ***Note:*** *I've been away on vacation so not much time for new full DDs yet. As to my previous post, I'll be researching and writing up on PayPal (most upvotes). As of now, PYPL is not a long, I am looking into whether its a short or a hold, more information to come.* ==================================================================== We recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market. **Background:** *Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)* **2018** * The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela. * New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**. * Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally. **2019** * January\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. * August\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro. * Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year. ==================================================================== **Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:** **December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees) **December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure \"illegal\" and an act of \"sabotage.\" The government invoked labor laws to immediately \"occupy\" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management. In a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)* If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \\~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can. Before the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain. * In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**. * In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession. * At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**. * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013) Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders. **The Valencia Plant** On September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to \"reactivate and modernize\" the Valencia plant. This investment was directed toward: 1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems. 2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery. 3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards. 4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. It is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers. If this plant was worth \\~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \\~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone. The capital saved by not having to build a greenfield site (a process that would take 24–36 months) allows Goodyear to quickly capture the post-war demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction. *Note: Honestly, I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investments/projects from $GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7-Year old factory into what is needed for $GT's tires. Unfortunately, I'm writing this up on a Sunday and that'd probably take more time than I'm willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence.* **Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs** Raw material costs typically account for 60% of total production expenses, while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20%. The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowest-cost producers in Goodyear’s global portfolio. Goodyear’s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A., a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures, and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis, continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19, 2025. The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia. The Trump administration’s stated goal is to \"get the oil flowing\" by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country’s broken infrastructure. This revival of the domestic petroleum industry, which has seen production stagnate at around 800,000–900,000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million+, will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and high-temperature polymers used in tire tread inserts. The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized, reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant. Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energy-intensive. The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela’s power. While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect, the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts. A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids. **There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM** If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028. **TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids. **There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM** If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028. **TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

      "selftext": "I believe this news is only partially priced in as we see the spike on Friday with some of the companies that will be involved. I think Chevron CVX is potentially the winner here as they’re already on the ground in Venezuela and have infrastructure there, I can see a spike with CVX on opening on Monday but I think when the news fades it could go down and I believe this could be the same for Crude Oil, I think investors will remember when the news fades that the oil market is already flooded with oil and in Venezuelas oil floods the market it will drive oil prices down further. I don’t think it possible for the oil to be extracted immediately as the already in place infrastructure is severely damaged including old pipelines from Venezuela to the US and over $100 billion in investment is needed and 5 - 8 years for recovery. There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further. I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not be affected by oil prices as they don’t sell oil. SLB is the “brains” of the operation, SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field, especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything. No company has the technology SLB does. Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump. HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela. They will also support Chevrons drilling. I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 - 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 - 18 months. With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping. One refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO, they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products, this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term. Another one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution.",

      "selftext_processed": "I believe this news is only partially priced in as we see the spike on Friday with some of the companies that will be involved . I think Chevron CVX is potentially the winner here as they ’ re already on the ground in Venezuela and have infrastructure there I can see a spike with CVX on opening on Monday but I think when the news fades it could go down and I believe this could be the same for Crude Oil I think investors will remember when the news fades that the oil market is already flooded with oil and in Venezuelas oil floods the market it will drive oil prices down further . I don ’ t think it possible for the oil to be extracted immediately as the already in place infrastructure is severely damaged including old pipelines from Venezuela to the US and over $ 100 billion in investment is needed and 5 8 years for recovery . There is also an embargo and sanctions that still have not_been lifted yet and this prevents any full scale operation there from any company but once the contracts are giving from the US treasury it can only make these companies stock go up further . I am looking at Halliburton HAL and Schlumberger SLB as I think these will both be excellent plays and will not_be affected by oil prices as they don ’ t sell oil . SLB is the “ brains ” of the operation SLB has the technology to detect all of Venezuelas remaining oil field especially the oil in the hard to reach places and SLB plans the extraction and maps everything . No_company has the technology SLB does . Halliburton HAL will be sent to repair the existing pipelines and pump . HAL will fix everything and they already have existing infrastructure in Venezuela . They will also support Chevrons drilling . I believe HAL could be profitable to hold for the next 6 12 months and SLB could be a good hold for the next 6 18 months . With these two companies you avoid the volatility of oil prices and the oil market getting flooded and prices dropping . One refinery in particular I am looking at it Valero VLO they specialize in refining Venezuela heavy crude products this could be a good long term play as profits will spike significantly long term . Another one to watch could be ConocoPhillips COP as they were an oil company involved in Venezuela many years ago and their equipment and assets were seized under the Moduro regime and are owed $ 10 billion because of this by Venezuela so I believe they will definitely get restitution ."

      "selftext": "I’m 20, not a trader, and I don’t have much experience in the market. I have about $15k invested total and I’m thinking about putting around 30% of it into a high-risk idea. I want honest opinions, not hype. My thinking is this: Venezuela has huge oil reserves, and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses, their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding. That wouldn’t be fast, but eventually someone has to do the work. Instead of betting on Venezuela directly, I’m looking at companies around it: – Chevron (CVX) since they’re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB, HAL, BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO, MPC, PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I’m unsure about and want feedback on: – Is this already priced in and I’m late to the idea? – If this ever happens, are we talking months or years before it matters? – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions, corruption, or not getting paid? – If you were making a small speculative bet like this, would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely? – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on? I’m not trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything. I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head. Any honest opinions appreciated",

I have about $ 15k invested total and I ’ m thinking about putting around 30 % of it into a highrisk idea . I want honest opinions not_hype . My thinking is this Venezuela has huge oil reserves and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding . That wouldn ’ t be fast but eventually someone has to do the work . Instead of betting on Venezuela directly I ’ m looking at companies around it – Chevron CVX since they ’ re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB HAL BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO MPC PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I ’ m unsure about and want feedback on – Is this already priced in and I ’ m late to the idea – If this ever happens are we talking months or years before it matters – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions corruption or not_getting paid – If you were making a small speculative bet like this would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on I ’ m not_trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything . I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head . Any honest opinions appreciated"

      "selftext": "For the Fully Paid Loaning / Share Lending programs from brokerages, are people seeing a disparity in rates given vs. rates reported (via Fintel, etc.)? * Forget Robinhood, which shows nothing, and they give you “up to 15% of the weighted average rebate rate ($/share) that Robinhood earned by lending the stock on that day”, so Robinhood pockets 85% of the interest earned, sounds more like the Sheriff of Nottingham… * Etrade seemed to be the opposite, offering much more of the pie (reverse of Robinhood) but it seems now they’re taking half the interest, i.e. whatever interest is reported on Fintel and other sites, the shares on loan are half that. * Schwab seems to be the same as Etrade, again giving half the reported interested for shares on loan. I wouldn’t expect 100% of the reported interest as they’re managing most of the work and risk; but it seems brokerages are keeping the details on interest paid out from share lending intentionally vague so they can do whatever they want (like decide tomorrow they‘ll give you table scraps for your shares instead of an actual portion). This is better than share lending that happened behind the scenes in the past with no income to the actual share owners; but the greed here is ridiculous. Anyone tracking brokerages and which ones are better for investors to participate in share lending? If they all suck, might be worth everyone just shutting off at once on a planned day.

      "selftext_processed": "For the Fully Paid Loaning Share Lending programs from brokerages are people seeing a disparity in rates given vs. rates reported via Fintel etc . Forget Robinhood which shows nothing_and they give you “ up to 15 % of the weighted average rebate rate $ share that Robinhood earned by lending the stock on that day ” so Robinhood pockets 85 % of the interest earned sounds more like the Sheriff of Nottingham… Etrade seemed to be the opposite offering much more of the pie reverse of Robinhood but it seems now they ’ re taking half the interest i.e . whatever interest is reported on Fintel and other sites the shares on loan are half that . Schwab seems to be the same as Etrade again giving half the reported interested for shares on loan . I wouldn ’ t expect 100 % of the reported interest as they ’ re managing most of the work and risk but it seems brokerages are keeping the details on interest paid out from share lending intentionally vague so they can do whatever they want like decide tomorrow they ‘ ll give you table scraps for your shares instead of an actual portion . This is better than share lending that happened behind the scenes in the past with no_income to the actual share owners but the greed here is ridiculous . Anyone tracking brokerages and which ones are better for investors to participate in share lending If they all suck might be worth everyone just shutting off at once on a planned day .

You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. Ok First of all i'm not good with words im more good with math and numbers... so i'll try to go to the point without too much political and economically approach jargon bs The technicals are out there([screenshot ](#1)... Gold has a certain pattern respecting the top uptrend line resistance, technically we can say from this point of view that it should how ever not 100% should go down and the same downtrend pattern for OIL([screenshot ](#2)... but it would need a catalyst for the prices to truly go down further... if we see the entire economic outlook, wars, inflation etc... there is no catalyst...not until now... and let me give you some evidence. First of all of the PREMISE(or i should say the promise)... USA wants and needs to cut inflation and debt for that they need to lower rates(there is tons of youtube videos of trump talking about lowering inflation and energy cost) if they lower rates yes we would probably get a nice stock bull run market... BUT and here is my point for how long? Evidence number 1: WARREN BUFFET (The greed) [ We are on overvaluated and highly greedy market, naturally markets needs to correct, yes for the new ones markets actually can correct 30% or more... its pure cycles and statistics. Evidence number 2: GOLD and OIL are the number one money wise backing up economic reserves... as the more people and countries accumulate prices go up because accumulation is also shortages and also consumption(chips, rockets..,etc). Evidence number 3: Venezuela is the world largest Oil reserve deposit but how much does the actual refinieries extract and export? Almost nothing(as seen in [scrshot ](#4) because it is under cartel or regime occupation. Evidence number 4: Venezuela is the second to third world largest GOLD(unmined) deposit(8900 tons)... now this is where things get a little tricky because not only this info is backedup by venezuela government but also U.S government and this is where next evidence comes in... Evidence number 5: U.S.A government and military intervention. They have been foresighting this scenario of control for some years now let me give you the source (keyword search: \"8,900\"): [ Now what do i think with this data will happen in the future well now i see 2 possible scenarios to occur, yes they are a bit speculation, but seen the wide angle and data presented for me it makes sense at least. Scenario 1: U.S.A gets controlled of their refineries and start mining and extracting oil and making deals ASAP, since this is new matter entering our economic space will create more supply eventualy causing the prices of everything to fall, energy, goods and services, some stocks might explode because of rates lowering. Scenario 2: China moves to Taiwan and changes government as eficient as USA militarily in Venezuela. Chips supply will fall, causing the U.S.A to prepare for the next Chips Recesion, either they'll need to move their photolitography out of the contry or rebuild it abroad... causing the economy of U.S.A to stagnate... AI develop will slowdown causing tech companies to correct... USA is preparing itself for china's next move thats why they need those refineries to start working thats how they will balance their economy as prices go down, they'll start acumulating more and more resources for the next A.I race between china and USA... A.I firsts Nuclear powered plants are set to be running by 2028-30 so they need to prepare for whats comming. >This is my bet puts on gold($3500), oil($40), and tech stock market NVIDIA($140)(only if china moves pieces) expiration date march 2027 What are your thoughts?",

Economic conditions markets and regulations can change rapidly and past performance is not_indicative of future results . You should conduct your own research and consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions . Ok First of all im not_good with words im more good with math and numbers ... so ill try to go to the point without too much political and economically approach jargon bs The technicals are out therescreenshot 1 ... Gold has a certain pattern respecting the top uptrend line resistance technically we can say from this point of view that it should how ever not_100 % should go down and the same downtrend pattern for OILscreenshot 2 ... but it would need a catalyst for the prices to truly go down further ... if we see the entire economic outlook wars inflation etc ... there is no_catalyst ... not until now ... and let me give you some evidence . First of all of the PREMISEor i should say the promise ... USA wants and needs to cut inflation and debt for that they need to lower ratesthere is tons of youtube videos of trump talking about lowering inflation and energy cost if they lower rates yes we would probably get a nice stock bull run market ... BUT and here is my point for how long Evidence number 1 WARREN BUFFET The greed We are on overvaluated and highly greedy market naturally markets needs to correct yes for the new ones markets actually can correct 30 % or more ... its pure cycles and statistics . Evidence number 2 GOLD and OIL are the number one money wise backing up economic reserves ... as the more people and countries accumulate prices go up because accumulation is also shortages and also consumptionchips rockets .. etc . Evidence number 3 Venezuela is the world largest Oil reserve deposit but how much does the actual refinieries extract and export Almost nothingas_seen in scrshot 4 because it is under cartel or regime occupation . Evidence number 4 Venezuela is the second to third world largest GOLDunmined deposit8900 tons ... now this is where things get a little tricky because not_only this info is backedup by venezuela government but also U.S government and this is where next evidence comes in ... Evidence number 5 U.S.A government and military intervention . They have been foresighting this scenario of control for some years now let me give you the source keyword search 8900 Now what do i think with this data will happen in the future well now i see 2 possible scenarios to occur yes they are a bit speculation but seen the wide angle and data presented for me it makes sense at least . Scenario 1 U.S.A gets controlled of their refineries and start mining and extracting oil and making deals ASAP since this is new matter entering our economic space will create more supply eventualy causing the prices of everything to fall energy goods and services some stocks might explode because of rates lowering . Scenario 2 China moves to Taiwan and changes government as eficient as USA militarily in Venezuela . Chips supply will fall causing the U.S.A to prepare for the next Chips Recesion either theyll need to move their photolitography out of the contry or rebuild it abroad ... causing the economy of U.S.A to stagnate ... AI develop will slowdown causing tech companies to correct ... USA is preparing itself for chinas next move thats why they need those refineries to start working thats how they will balance their economy as prices go down theyll start acumulating more and more resources for the next A.I race between china and USA ... A.I firsts Nuclear powered plants are set to be running by 202830 so they need to prepare for whats comming . This is my bet puts on gold $ 3500 oil $ 40 and tech stock market NVIDIA $ 140only if china moves pieces expiration date march 2027 What are your thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I have a question and appreciate any insight or guidance. I am able to put away at least 2k/month. Last year, I put it all into a HYSA paying 3.5%. This year though, I am planning to do something different based on 2 ideas. First idea is that it’s way more beneficial to be invested in something of value that appreciates. Second idea is that energy/infrastructure, robotics, and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets. With that in mind, I plan to split the 2000/month 4 ways; 500 into a Roth IRA (holding VT/SCHG/ROBO/XLU), 500 into HYSA, 500 into QQQI/SLVR, 500 into *something else*. It’s the something else that I have a question about. Below are the stocks I’m considering: Energy/Infra: TAN, GRID, IREN Metals: SILJ, REMX, GLTR. ROBOTICS: ARKQ Moonshots: ETHA, BMNR, IBIT, JD, QXO, SLS, POET, CSIQ, AMPX, TE, ARRY, LAC, PATH. I plan to have a combination of shares/leaps from 2-3 of those. Eventually, want to get into covered calls too. Goal is to grow account and eventually start generating passive income. Any critique, information, or advice is welcomed. I have a pension, 457b, and 30k in crypto. I’m 34 and expecting a child next year.",

      "selftext": "Venezuela’s infrastructure is broken. Pipelines are 50 years old and leaking. It will take billions and years of work by companies like **Schlumberger** and **Halliburton** to get production back to 2 million barrels per day. Now to the reffineries: The real money in this scenario is made through the crack spread, which is the profit margin a refinery earns by turning raw crude into products like diesel and jet fuel. When cheap Venezuelan heavy oil enters the market, the input costs for complex refiners like **Valero** or **Marathon Petroleum** drop drastically. Since they sell their finished fuel at global market prices, their margins expand even if the overall price of oil is falling. Logistics: The shift in tanker routes would be dramatic and rapid. Currently, Venezuelan oil moves on ghost tankers to Asia via secretive ship-to-ship transfers to bypass sanctions. A political shift would redirect this flow back to its natural market in the United States. Instead of a forty-day journey to China, the oil would only take four days to reach refineries in Houston or Lake Charles. (any suggestions?) Finally, you have to consider the impact on the US shale industry. If the return of Venezuelan barrels pushes the price of WTI crude below the fifty dollar mark, many US producers in places like the Permian Basin will no longer be profitable(?).",

      "title": "What does Trump really want with Venezuela? Here are the Best Takes and stocks",
      "selftext": "We’ve all read the news, but what are Trumps real motivations. What do you guys think he wants? 1. Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices, or more importantly, give Trump additional control over the global economy through the oil supply. This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip (e.g. to weaken Iranian, Russian, Chinese economies, or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage). Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch - personally i’m staying away. 2. Not only does Venezuela hold oil, but it also holds lots of gold. While Gold is currently trading at all time highs (and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves), Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘reinforce’ the safety of the dollar. Or, again, he may wish to leverage control. I am holding IAUM, but may sell some to resize. Again interesting to watch. 3. Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible (potentially Venezuelan) assets - I don’t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless. 4. US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure. As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, ‘massive fleets of diesel and gas’ generators (35GW massive) may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy / grid upgrades materialise. It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel, if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons, but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background. 5. All of this can be very damaging to China, as well as the fact that China has been ‘renting’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold, oil and rare earth materials. While I don’t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant, snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego. There may be a rise in the likes of USAR… Personally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau, and pending Trumps actions, maybe even fall. Oil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something, although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years. Did i miss anything?",

      "selftext_processed": "We ’ ve all read the news but what are Trumps real motivations . What do you guys think he wants 1 . Flooding the global oil supply will lower prices or more importantly give Trump additional control over the global economy through the oil supply . This may potentially be used as a bargaining chip e.g . to weaken Iranian Russian Chinese economies or to strengthen the dollar through Tariff style manipulation and leverage . Funds like USO and UCO will be interesting to watch personally i ’ m staying away . 2 . Not_only does Venezuela hold oil but it also holds lots of gold . While Gold is currently trading at all time highs and many economies like BRICS have been stocking up on reserves Trump may wish to crash the gold price to ‘ reinforce ’ the safety of the dollar . Or again he may wish to leverage control . I am holding IAUM but may sell some to resize . Again interesting to watch . 3 . Some have also speculated a digital currency backed by tangible potentially Venezuelan assets I don ’ t really buy this but its interesting nonetheless . 4 . US grid capacity shortages have been noticeable and heavy generators are already being rolled out to fuel Data Centres and AI Infrastructure . As mentioned by Energy Secretary Chris Wright ‘ massive fleets of diesel and gas ’ generators 35GW massive may help to bridge the gap until renewable energy grid upgrades materialise . It would cost a huge amount to buy that much fuel if only I could get it for free… I think CAT is a miss for other reasons but GNRC and CMI might be good plays given this background . 5 . All of this can be very damaging to China as well as the fact that China has been ‘ renting ’ Venezuelan resources through loans granting them rights to gold oil and rare earth materials . While I don ’ t think that the Rare Earths are particularly significant snubbing China is still useful for Trump in terms of resources and ego . There may be a rise in the likes of USAR… Personally I believe that the gold price and ETFs will start to plateau and pending Trumps actions maybe even fall . Oil ETFs will probably remain fairly stable until Trump does something although I believe that stocks such as HAL or CVX would be solid investments over the next two years . Did i miss anything"

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a (fledgling) Value Investor. It has been a very interesting ride to say the least, and I feel I've learned a lot over that time. Naturally, there is still a lot more for me to learn. Of course, one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the long-term. It is a question I'm sure we all ask ourselves. I know 5 years is not \"long-term\", however, it's a good checkpoint along the path. So, here are my results against the S&P 500 benchmark (w/dividends included for both) and brief thoughts on what I learned: |Year / Portfolio|My Portfolio|S&P 500^(1)| |:-|:--:|:--:| |2021|15.95%|28.26%| |2022|\\-29.46%|\\-14.99%| |2023|42.86%|21.69%| |2024|43.99%|30.03%| |2025|25.05%|15.45%| |**CAGR**|**16.04%**|**14.78%**| ^(1 - S&P 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars & Data.) 2021: 11 positions EOY. This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first. Mistakes were made... Most, if not All, of them. My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noise/static/garbage, and should not be heavily weighted as \"research\". 2022: Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year. Acquired three new positions (one spin-off). New META position closed $120 with my cost basis was ~$197. The other hurt was MHH; I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop. Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage, but I should have applied to MHH also. Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down w/META, which I should not have applied to MHH. 2023: This year was mainly building on what I already owned. I sold out a very small position in IDN, started in 2021. Bought with no real due diligence, then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled. Sold at a 73% loss. Started with 10 positions. Ended with 10 positions. I don't know that there was huge lesson to '23. I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss, but held a few months longer as a reminder. 2024: I had a bit more movement this year. I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out (MDC). Realized I didn't know enough to hold WAL or MU, which fell outside my circle of competence. Hindsight being 20/20, I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU... Started three new positions. The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions. 9 positions. 2025: I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position. With MHH, I realized there was an emotional attachment, that management was not turning it around, and accepted my thesis was wrong. Took the ~40% loss. I also tested out selling covered calls. Did this with WBD, which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years. Lesson 1 was I'm still human and at times irrational. I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally, such as with MHH. Lesson 2 is that I do not understand options well at all, and I am really not temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding. Lesson 3 was/is a reminder to be patient. I did not find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued. And that is okay! I don't need to swing at any pitches to do well.

      "selftext_processed": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a fledgling Value Investor . It has been a very interesting ride to say the least and I feel Ive learned a lot over that time . Naturally there is still a lot more for me to learn . Of course one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the longterm . It is a question Im sure we all ask ourselves . I know 5 years is not_longterm however its a good checkpoint along the path . So here are my results against the SP 500 benchmark wdividends included for both and brief thoughts on what I learned Year PortfolioMy PortfolioSP 5001 202115.95 % 28.26 % 202229.46 % 14.99 % 202342.86 % 21.69 % 202443.99 % 30.03 % 202525.05 % 15.45 % CAGR16.04 % 14.78 % 1 SP 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars Data . 2021 11 positions EOY . This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first . Mistakes were made ... Most if not_All of them . My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noisestaticgarbage and should not_be heavily weighted as research . 2022 Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year . Acquired three new positions one spinoff . New META position closed $ 120 with my cost basis was $ 197 . The other hurt was MHH I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop . Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage but I should have applied to MHH also . Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down wMETA which I should not_have applied to MHH . 2023 This year was mainly building on what I already owned . I sold out a very small position in IDN started in 2021 . Bought with no_real due diligence then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled . Sold at a 73 % loss . Started with 10 positions . Ended with 10 positions . I dont know that there was huge lesson to 23 . I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss but held a few months longer as a reminder . 2024 I had a bit more movement this year . I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out MDC . Realized I didnt know enough to hold WAL or MU which fell outside my circle of competence . Hindsight being 2020 I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU ... Started three new positions . The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions . 9 positions . 2025 I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position . With MHH I realized there was an emotional attachment that management was not_turning it around and accepted my thesis was wrong . Took the 40 % loss . I also tested out selling covered calls . Did this with WBD which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years . Lesson 1 was Im still human and at times irrational . I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally such as with MHH . Lesson 2 is that I do not_understand options well at all and I am really not_temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding . Lesson 3 wasis a reminder to be patient . I did not_find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued . And that is okay I dont need to swing at any pitches to do well . cross post full text from Value Investing sub"

      "selftext": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA, MU, META, GOOGL, MSFT and LLY. This week, I’m taking a deeper dive into META. [META Valuation Analysis]( Trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue through 9/30/25 was $189 billion with a 43% operating margin. The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21% in 2025 to $199 billion and 18% in 2026 to $235 billion. 99% of revenue and 122% of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division. This is comprised of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. The Reality Labs division generated $2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $18 billion. **Value Score** META generates 61 Value Points from 43% TTM operating margin plus 18% projected revenue growth. Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a **Value Score of 3.5**. This puts META firmly in Buy territory. There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI. Given that statement, I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company. TTM capital expenditures were $63 billion, 68% higher than $37 billion for 2024. The company’s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $70-72 billion. For 2026, I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance. This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow. The **adjusted Value Score of 1.5** is firmly in Hold territory. **Segment Valuation** Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value. The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $100 billion is 3.36, while the median Value Points is 25.84. This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple. For simplicity and to be generous, **I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division**. I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps’ $187 billion of revenue. I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs’ $2 billion of revenue, which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric. The formula suggests that **META has 27% potential upside in its stock price**. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I previously posted that my portfolio going into 2026 is comprised of NVDA MU META GOOGL MSFT and LLY . This week I ’ m taking a deeper dive into META . META Valuation Analysis Trailing twelvemonth TTM revenue through 93025 was $ 189 billion with a 43 % operating margin . The Wall Street consensus is for revenue to increase 21 % in 2025 to $ 199 billion and 18 % in 2026 to $ 235 billion . 99 % of revenue and 122 % of operating income comes from the Family of Apps division . This is comprised of Facebook Instagram WhatsApp etc . The Reality Labs division generated $ 2 billion of TTM revenue with an operating loss of $ 18 billion . Value Score META generates 61 Value Points from 43 % TTM operating margin plus 18 % projected revenue growth . Dividing this by the operating multiple of 17 provides a Value Score of 3.5 . This puts META firmly in Buy territory . There was a lot of concern at the last earnings call when META mentioned they were going to invest heavily in AI . Given that statement I wanted to look at the free cash flow of the company . TTM capital expenditures were $ 63 billion 68 % higher than $ 37 billion for 2024 . The company ’ s cap ex guidance for 2025 was $ 7072 billion . For 2026 I assumed the cap ex would grow slightly from the 2025 guidance . This created a multiple of 42 for the enterprise value divided by the projected unlevered free cash flow . The adjusted Value Score of 1.5 is firmly in Hold territory . Segment Valuation Another technique for valuing the company was to apply revenue multiples to each division and see if the projected equity value is greater than or less than the current market value . The median trailing revenue multiple for companies with a market value greater than $ 100 billion is 3.36 while the median Value Points is 25.84 . This implies that each 7.7 Value Points is worth a 1x multiple . For simplicity and to be generous I assumed a 1x multiple for each 7 Value Points of the division . I applied an 11x multiple to the Family of Apps ’ $ 187 billion of revenue . I was very generous in applying a 3x multiple to Reality Labs ’ $ 2 billion of revenue which is really a startup valuation metric rather than a public company metric . The formula suggests that META has 27 % potential upside in its stock price . As always please do your own research before making any investment decision ."

We better refrain from anything stupid with Taiwan so we stay out of trouble.\" Although i hope for the scenario number 2, i am afraid that we are facing scenario number 1 in very close future. But Taiwan war, if to be conventional and not nuclear, could mean definitely disruption if not total destruction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities. That would throw whole world into economical depression of unknown dimensions. Since the Taiwan is global hub for semiconductor manufacturing, its of course of vital importance for the whole global economy, especially after AI have propelled tech sector to such highs that it makes up pretty significant part of economy output. So what do you think, is this really probable or am i just being hysterical?",

If US can do this to sovereign country we can do it as well to an island which is according to CCP part of our country and long overdue for reunification . 2 . Damn US really mean business . We better refrain from anything stupid with Taiwan so we stay out of trouble . Although i hope for the scenario number 2 i am afraid that we are facing scenario number 1 in very close future . But Taiwan war if to be conventional and not_nuclear could mean definitely disruption if not_total destruction of semiconductor manufacturing facilities . That would throw whole world into economical depression of unknown dimensions . Since the Taiwan is global hub for semiconductor manufacturing its of course of vital importance for the whole global economy especially after AI have propelled tech sector to such highs that it makes up pretty significant part of economy output . So what do you think is this really probable or am i just being hysterical"

      "title": "Why I think Quantumscape is a great company for value investors with a growth mindset",
      "selftext": "Our edge as retail investors are 2 things; to be contrarian and to take timelines others are not willing to. I find this personally to be anywhere upwards of 3 years. With these in mind I found Quantumscape towards the end of 2021 midway through its intial covid money hype run For some history we have been using very similar to sony's commercialized 1991 lithium ion battery for the last 34 years, we have done a million minor changes to optimize the energy density, cycle count, safety and discharge rate but at this point we are maxed out in what it can do for us Quantumscape's moat while cliche being similar to TSMC/Nvidia partnership, through non stop learning and adapting to newer chemistries they have the next 10 years planned out to modernize the lithium battery and energy industry further than their intial 2028 consumer production battery without having to handle the actual production themselves. This should allow them to maintain their leadership role of at least 2 years. These improvements will come in the form of EVs, ebikes, stationary storage either grid or home, lighter phones and while not being enough for large passenger aircraft they should aid the EVtol and drone markets Their technology of a ceramic seperator that lacks imperfections on the nanoscale allows them to remove the anode from the battery and instead allows for lithium plating during the charging process without destructive dendrites from forming. Currently the anode's limitation to the amount of energy a battery can store in either Wh/L (watt hour per litre) or Wh/Kg. By being able to remove the anode liquid solution this opens the potential for even higher energy densities beyond NMC down the line. Now to get to why its a good thing as comsumers. The semi solid state battery Quantumscape plans to unveil will have 50% better energy density(range anxiety no more), be able to easily handle 800 charge/discharge cycles even at fast charging rates of 4C+ (10mins 10-80%) and after these 800cycles still be at 80% max capacity, be adaptable to temperature changes that currently reduce lithium ion battery's winter capacity by 30-50%(at -15 to -35Cº) all while being a lot more stable than the already pretty good batteries so even less risk of fire. As value investors we see a lot of chaotic business management teams in the market. Another reason I like Quantumscape is their understanding of slow and steady, they have been chugging away at this mission for 15 years now under their CTO Standford's professor Dr Tim Holme. Coupled by their conservative understanding of market dynamics they have been able to raise money at times to keep themselves liquid through the last 3 years to ride out the market uncertainty without needing to pivot. At this point they sit on 1B cash and have partnerships with Murata and Corning so that they can focus on developing the technology and production output plans without having to handle production scaleout directly. They have also been very open about timelines and being clear about where they are and will be and following it If you're interested, Quantumscape's youtube is a goldmine of technical info including debunking many competitor's technology claims including inferior silicon anodes. The r/Quantumscape_Stock sub is also great for following the business under the microscope",

      "selftext_processed": "Our edge as retail investors are 2 things to be contrarian and to take timelines others are not_willing to . I find this personally to be anywhere upwards of 3 years . With these in mind I found Quantumscape towards the end of 2021 midway through its intial covid money hype run For some history we have been using very similar to sonys commercialized 1991 lithium ion battery for the last 34 years we have done a million minor changes to optimize the energy density cycle count safety and discharge rate but at this point we are maxed out in what it can do for us Quantumscapes moat while cliche being similar to TSMCNvidia partnership through non stop learning and adapting to newer chemistries they have the next 10 years planned out to modernize the lithium battery and energy industry further than their intial 2028 consumer production battery without having to handle the actual production themselves . This should allow them to maintain their leadership role of at least 2 years . These improvements will come in the form of EVs ebikes stationary storage either grid or home lighter phones and while not_being enough for large passenger aircraft they should aid the EVtol and drone markets Their technology of a ceramic seperator that lacks imperfections on the nanoscale allows them to remove the anode from the battery and instead allows for lithium plating during the charging process without destructive dendrites from forming . Currently the anodes limitation to the amount of energy a battery can store in either WhL watt hour per litre or WhKg . By being able to remove the anode liquid solution this opens the potential for even higher energy densities beyond NMC down the line . Now to get to why its a good thing as comsumers . The semi solid state battery Quantumscape plans to unveil will have 50 % better energy densityrange anxiety no_more be able to easily handle 800 chargedischarge cycles even at fast charging rates of 4C 10mins 1080 % and after these 800cycles still be at 80 % max capacity be adaptable to temperature changes that currently reduce lithium ion batterys winter capacity by 3050 % at 15 to 35Cº all while being a lot more stable than the already pretty good batteries so even less risk of fire . As value investors we see a lot of chaotic business management teams in the market . Another reason I like Quantumscape is their understanding of slow and steady they have been chugging away at this mission for 15 years now under their CTO Standfords professor Dr Tim Holme . Coupled by their conservative understanding of market dynamics they have been able to raise money at times to keep themselves liquid through the last 3 years to ride out the market uncertainty without needing to pivot . At this point they sit on 1B cash and have partnerships with Murata and Corning so that they can focus on developing the technology and production output plans without having to handle production scaleout directly . They have also been very open about timelines and being clear about where they are and will be and following it If youre interested Quantumscapes youtube is a goldmine of technical info including debunking many competitors technology claims including inferior silicon anodes . The rQuantumscape_Stock sub is also great for following the business under the microscope"

      "selftext": "Recently started a new position with the local government, and hoping for some advice. I have a \"Retirement Plan\" account with my previous employer, and have both pre-tax and after tax funds mixed in. I also have an ESOP, it is a privately traded company, and no dividends. Currently my plan is to roll over the pre-tax portion of the \"Retirement Plan\" and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA, and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA. My question is, is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b? (The 457b is brand new, has a limited selection of only 25 stocks/bonds/TDFs, and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF.) Also, I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA. I currently dont plan to retire early, and in the set it and forget it mindset. I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not, but if any is needed I can add it. Ultimately, is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA?",

I have a Retirement Plan account with my previous employer and have both pretax and after tax funds mixed in . I also have an ESOP it is a privately traded company and no_dividends . Currently my plan is to roll over the pretax portion of the Retirement Plan and ESOP accounts into a Rollover IRA and then the after tax portion into my Roth IRA . My question is is it worth looking more into rolling these two accounts over into my 457b The 457b is brand new has a limited selection of only 25 stocksbondsTDFs and currently defaulted to a 2060 TDF . Also I am over the income limit to contribute to a TIRA . I currently dont plan to retire early and in the set it and forget it mindset . I dont know if any other information would be helpful or not_but if any is needed I can add it . Ultimately is it worth it to roll over these account into a 457b or keep them in a TIRA"

      "selftext": "I invested approximately $1,200 in Take-Two Interactive (proof posted above) following the ~10% drop after the announcement of the GTA VI delay. I believe GTA VI has the potential to be the largest media release of the decade. Given the recent pullback and the currently favorable USD/GBP exchange rate (I invest in GBP as a UK-based investor), I am considering doubling my position if the share price declines a further 2%. This would be a 1-3 years investment, with the intention of holding until the market has reflects impact of GTA VI in the share price. This position currently represents roughly 1/25 of my portfolio, with the remainder allocated to more conservative investments such as Fidelity global dividend funds. Before doing so I wanted to ask the community whether increasing exposure to Take-Two at these levels is a reasonable strategy, or if this capital would be better invested elsewhere. Thanks!",

Scan criteria is as follows: Reasonable share price vs book value (except MU, I’m willing to pay a higher ratio here for tech) Must haves: Current EPS growth higher than 5 yr avg Positive P/E Current revenue growth higher than 5 yr avg Return on equity growth higher than 5 yr avg Here are the companies I’ve chosen so far: NBN - financial exposure with strong recent earnings growth and relatively low p/e compared to industry average. OHI - real estate exposure with strong EPS, Revenue, and ROE growth while staying at 5 yr P/E avg. I also firmly believe long term care will continue to have strong demand in the future. MU - tech exposure with absurd EPS, Revenue, and ROE growth. Current P/E of 27x is only about 2 times its 5 yr avg and is significantly lower than the industry average of 37-47x. I believe RAM is the bottleneck for AI development at the moment and MU is set up to benefit greatly as I believe it’s undervalued significantly. UHS - healthcare exposure, good earnings growth, low p/e. I think there’s still a stigma in the United States about mental health currently and opinions will change as people realize how important it is. I’m looking to add an Energy and Materials pick to this list in the near future. Let me know what you think!",

According to Benzinga Pro data, Tesla's December 30 high was $463.12, which would translate to shares worth over $97.5 million donated by the CEO. Influencer **Sawyer Merritt**, in a post on the social media platform X said that the shares were transferred as part of “year-end tax planning.” Merritt, in another post, added that the shares were donated by the CEO to his charitable trust. > In a separate post on X on Wednesday, the billionaire claimed that once the amount of taxes paid by him, in a year's time, \"broke\" the **Internal Revenue Service** (IRS) system. \"Too many digits. They had to update the software to get it processed,\" the billionaire shared in the post. Musk had earlier slammed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), calling the Senator a \"taker\" who can never make anything. Musk also said that all of his wealth was tied to Tesla and SpaceX shares, adding that an increase in share value would occur with good quality products and services. Sanders, on the other hand, has been a vocal critic of Musk and other billionaires on multiple occasions, urging the federal government to introduce taxation on the wealthy. Sanders has also opposed the tech industry’s AI and Robotics push.",

      "title": "The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals).",
      "selftext": "My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally. That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains. My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested. I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era…. The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities. Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market. History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price. That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials. I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure. That’s the bet. TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned. Edit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "My investment thesis is straightforward over the next decade markets will increasingly reward secure politically aligned supply chains not_simply the lowestcost producers . Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy and when that happens pricing capital flows and valuations change structurally . That ’ s why I ’ m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Westernaligned supply chains . My core holdings are Energy Fuels UUUU Cameco CCJ Centrus Energy LEU MP Materials MP and Lynas LYSDY . $ 300k USD invested . I chose these USUS allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities can not easily replace . Together they cover uranium mining nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment and rare earth production and processing outside of China . China controls the majority of these rare earths and following Venezeula supply restrictions are only going to get worse . We ’ re in the hoarding era… . The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story but I think that framing misses the larger signal . Whether oil supply increases or not_is secondary . The more important takeaway is geopolitical the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved . That reinforces a world where energy materials and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than freemarket commodities . Importantly Venezuela does not_pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths . These markets are nothing_like oil . Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through longterm contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance . Rare earths require not_just mining but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop . There is no_mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market . History supports this view . During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run prices did not_rise because of speculative demand alone . They rose because utilities realized they were undercontracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure longterm supply . Once utilities began competing for material prices moved violently and quickly and equities rerated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated . Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was . I expect a very similar situation to take place between 20262028 . After Venezuela the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Skyrocket . Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren ’ t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises . When utilities and governments fear supply disruption they don ’ t negotiate for the best price they secure supply at almost any price . That historical lesson matters today . Nuclear power is expanding globally enrichment capacity is constrained and nonChina rare earth supply remains limited . At the same time geopolitical risk is rising not_falling . If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be riskoff across all assets . But the secondorder effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy subsidies and longterm contracts favoring Westernaligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials . I ’ m not_positioned for a shortterm commodity spike . I ’ m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost just as they did in prior cycles . In those environments uranium and rare earth equities don ’ t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure . That ’ s the bet . TLDR Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets history shows these markets don ’ t reprice gradually they reprice violently when supply security is questioned . Edit TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY . MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY"

      "title": "$META has a huge potential",
      "selftext": "I've been eyeing Meta recently. I know it's not a biotech with a $200M market cap and it's not rocketing, but I think it has potential, even if it's been slow lately. First of all, what does Meta do? We all know it for its social media (IG, Facebook, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Threads), which have an incredible 3.5 billion users daily. It's practically a monopoly, but officially it hasn't been deemed such, so we're safe. They generate incredible cash flow and advertise themselves, but we'll see about that later. Furthermore, even if it seems like Meta has fallen behind in certain hot sectors, that's not the case. They've actually launched into AI development (Meta AI, the one integrated into their platforms, which may seem behind but has 1 billion downloads), AR, and VR with products like Meta Quest and the new Ray-Ban sunglasses. But let's take a step back: how does Meta make money? How does it spend? Debt? Cash? Let's analyze the Q3 2025 balance sheet Total revenue: $51.24 billion (+26% YoY) Family of Apps (FB, IG, WA, Messenger): $50.8 billion (99% of total) Almost all from advertising: $50.1 billion (+26% YoY) Ad impressions +14% Average price per ad +10% Reality Labs (VR/AR/Quest/glasses): only $470 million (+74% YoY) What do we learn? It earns almost all its revenue from ads on social apps, which generates a constant cash flow. Total expenses Q3: $30.71 billion (+32% YoY) Main items: salaries, infrastructure, legal, depreciation Guidance for full-year 2025 expenses: $116-118 billion (+22-24% YoY) Capex Q3: $19.37 billion Guidance for full-year 2025 Capex: $70-72 billion (huge for AI data centers, GPUs, infrastructure) Where the big cash is going: AI infrastructure (data centers, compute) Reality Labs losses: ~$4-5 billion per quarter Buybacks & Dividends The company is spending heavily on future products that are still losing money. Cash & marketable securities (September 30, 2025): $44.45 billion Long-term debt: $28.83 billion (stable, not pumping debt) Net cash: +$15.6 billion (cash > debt) Q3 free cash flow: $10.63 billion (positive despite crazy capex) I'd like to point out that last quarter's earnings were drastically reduced due to some occasional tax payments. In my opinion, I see an opportunity here: despite being an already established company with a generous market cap of 1.64T, I believe it could still yield significant potential (we've seen the rise of even larger companies like Alphabet or Nvidia). While it's accumulating cash with minimal expenses through social media ads, which are now (fortunately or unfortunately) ingrained in our daily lives, it's investing mountains of money (which it earns regularly and without debt) in innovative sectors and products with significant growth potential, which could eventually dominate their industry. It hasn't had incredible performances lately; compared to its sector peers, it performed much less strongly last year, even less than the SP500 (which could be an advantage; for once, we're not buying at the highs). It currently has a P/E ratio of 29, which isn't particularly low, but I urge you to look for something less overvalued in the current market, especially in the tech sector. If there were to be a retracement or even a bear market in 2026, as some claim, Meta should be less affected, being already closer to its fair value. So, I'm thinking about it. Do you already have any shares or options? What do you think? Obviously, this isn't financial advice; do your research before deciding.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been eyeing Meta recently . I know its not_a biotech with a $ 200M market cap and its not_rocketing but I think it has potential even if its been slow lately . First of all what does Meta do We all know it for its social media IG Facebook WhatsApp Messenger and Threads which have an incredible 3.5 billion users daily . Its practically a monopoly but officially it hasnt been deemed such so were safe . They generate incredible cash flow and advertise themselves but well see about that later . Furthermore even if it seems like Meta has fallen behind in certain hot sectors thats not_the case . Theyve actually launched into AI development Meta AI the one integrated into their platforms which may seem behind but has 1 billion downloads AR and VR with products like Meta Quest and the new RayBan sunglasses . But lets take a step back how does Meta make money How does it spend Debt Cash Lets analyze the Q3 2025 balance sheet Total revenue $ 51.24 billion 26 % YoY Family of Apps FB IG WA Messenger $ 50.8 billion 99 % of total Almost all from advertising $ 50.1 billion 26 % YoY Ad impressions 14 % Average price per ad 10 % Reality Labs VRARQuestglasses only $ 470 million 74 % YoY What do we learn It earns almost all its revenue from ads on social apps which generates a constant cash flow . Total expenses Q3 $ 30.71 billion 32 % YoY Main items salaries infrastructure legal depreciation Guidance for fullyear 2025 expenses $ 116118 billion 2224 % YoY Capex Q3 $ 19.37 billion Guidance for fullyear 2025 Capex $ 7072 billion huge for AI data centers GPUs infrastructure Where the big cash is going AI infrastructure data centers compute Reality Labs losses $ 45 billion per quarter Buybacks Dividends The company is spending heavily on future products that are still losing money . Cash marketable securities September 30 2025 $ 44.45 billion Longterm debt $ 28.83 billion stable not_pumping debt Net cash $ 15.6 billion cash debt Q3 free cash flow $ 10.63 billion positive despite crazy capex Id like to point out that last quarters earnings were drastically reduced due to some occasional tax payments . In my opinion I see an opportunity here despite being an already established company with a generous market cap of 1.64T I believe it could still yield significant potential weve seen the rise of even larger companies like Alphabet or Nvidia . While its accumulating cash with minimal expenses through social media ads which are now fortunately or unfortunately ingrained in our daily lives its investing mountains of money which it earns regularly and without debt in innovative sectors and products with significant growth potential which could eventually dominate their industry . It hasnt had incredible performances lately compared to its sector peers it performed much less strongly last year even less than the SP500 which could be an advantage for once were not_buying at the highs . It currently has a PE ratio of 29 which isnt particularly low but I urge you to look for something less overvalued in the current market especially in the tech sector . If there were to be a retracement or even a bear market in 2026 as some claim Meta should be less affected being already closer to its fair value . So Im thinking about it . Do you already have any shares or options What do you think Obviously this isnt financial advice do your research before deciding ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor. But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game. >The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week. >BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history. >BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market. >In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1. >Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025. >Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers. >Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites. >The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year. >To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features. >Aggressive competition >BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets. >Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars. >BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025. >While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share. >From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%. >Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies. >Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end",

      "selftext_processed": "Source In 2011 Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor . But some 14 years later BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game . The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world ’ s largest seller of EVs according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week . BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs up nearly 28 % from 2024 . Meanwhile Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales Deliveries fell 8.6 % to only 1.6 million recording the biggest annual drop in the company ’ s history . BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not_available for purchase in America while China is Tesla ’ s secondlargest market . In the fourth quarter Tesla ’ s sales came in at about 418000 down 15.6 % from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $ 7500 tax credit expired on October 1 . Unlike other automakers Tesla does not_report its sales by market providing only global figures but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue according to company reports . Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025 . Tesla ’ s deliveries had grown nearly 50 % a year at one point . But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 posting a modest 1 % decline . Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers such a BYD and legacy global automakers as well as backlash against Musk ’ s political activities which angered many potential American and European buyers . Early in the year when Musk was leading the Trump administration ’ s Department of Government Efficiency there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites . The rush to take advantage of the soontoexpire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter . But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year . To try to counter the loss of the tax credit Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars but those versions while costing about $ 5000 less than their “ premium ” equivalents also won ’ t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features . Aggressive competition BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market . The intense __ in China has prompted the Shenzhenbased company to expand further overseas though its lowprice strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets . Growth in BYD ’ s overall sales including EVs and hybrids slowed to its weakest pace in five years with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company ’ s struggles in China the world ’ s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars . BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025 . While China ’ s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers according to HSBC ’ s research . Rivals like Geely China ’ s secondlargest EV maker fastrising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi which debuted its first EV only in 2024 have gradually eroded BYD ’ s domestic market share . From a peak of 35 % in 2023 BYD ’ s market share fell to 29 % in the first 11 months of 2025 according to China Passenger Car Association . In the same period last year its sales declined more than 5 % while Geely ’ s surged nearly 90 % . Wang Chuanfu BYD ’ s founder and CEO attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD ’ s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting according to staterun media . But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies . Shares of Tesla TSLA rose 1.2 % in early trading Friday . Shares closed 2025 up 18.6 % for the year as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk ’ s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “ army ” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon . But so far the rollout of Tesla ’ s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises limited to two metropolitan areas Austin Texas and San Francisco rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year ’ s end"

      "selftext": "TSLA is up over 2% in premarket trading, even though its Q4 delivery and production numbers came in below expectations. Here are the key figures from the release: Q4 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles (vs. estimates around 440,907) Q4 production: 434,358 vehicles (vs. projected \\~470,780) Full-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles On the surface, this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production, which would normally pressure the stock. Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open. A few possible reasons for the move: Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization, AI/robotics, autonomy, or longer-term narratives rather than near-term unit counts Positioning and short-term flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today’s session: Is this strength sustainable, or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully? Curious how others are reading this, bullish resilience, or a setup for volatility once regular trading kicks in?",

      "title": "Gold & Silver Kick Off 2026 With Gains, But Big Index Rebalancing Could Trigger a Sharp Pullback",
      "selftext": "TL;DR: Gold and silver are starting the new year strong after their massive 2025 runs (best since 1979), but a major Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) rebalancing starting next week is set to force \\~$5B in silver sales and \\~$6B in gold potentially causing a nasty short-term dip, especially in silver. Long-term outlook still bullish on rate cuts, weak dollar, and safe-haven demand. Article Summary (from Bloomberg): Gold up \\~1-2% early session, pushing toward $4,400/oz (spot around $4,330-$4,390 depending on timing). Silver up over 3%, hitting \\~$73-74/oz. Both building on epic 2025 gains: gold smashed multiple records on central bank buying, Fed easing, weaker USD, and geopolitics/trade tensions. Silver outperformed gold hard last year, fueled by the same plus industrial demand and tariff fears on refined metal. The Big Caveat: Index Rebalancing Headwind Silver currently \\~9% of BCOM (major commodity benchmark, \\~$109B tracked), but 2026 target weight drops to under 4%. That means passive funds/ETFs have to dump over $5B in silver futures during the 5-day roll period starting \\~Jan 8-10. Gold also overweight – \\~$6B in sales expected. TD Securities strategist: Expects 13% of total Comex silver open interest sold in the next two weeks → \"dramatic repricing lower.\" Low post-holiday liquidity could make moves even wilder. Bullish Side for 2026 More Fed rate cuts expected → supports non-yielding metals. Potential USD weakness under Trump policies. Ongoing central bank gold buying. Geopolitical risks and haven demand. Goldman Sachs calling for gold to $4,900/oz base case (upside risks higher). What This Means for Traders/Investors Short-term: Watch for volatility next week – could be a dip-buying opportunity if you're long precious metals miners (GDX, SILJ) or physical/ETFs (GLD, SLV). Silver likely gets hit harder. Long-term: Fundamentals still point higher, especially if macro gets messy. Anyone positioning for the rebalancing sell-off, or holding through it? Thoughts on miners vs. bullion here? or ?",

The rolodex of choices like options, margins, leverage, covered calls, cash secured puts, CFDs, complex rebalancing, chasing the next hot stock, finding the next NVDA, the list goes on, all this are mostly rooted in greed, you want to beat the market and optimise for a few more percentage points, or just plain gamble for a big win. If you just do the work for 10-15 years and stay put, the rest of your life your wealth will compound by itself. I've seen a chart where you're actually 25% to becoming millionaire at 100K and 54% to a millionaire at 300k. All because of compounding.",

Heck you can even DCA until 45 and never_invest again and you will still end up with $ 8.3M . Assuming 11 % annual gains . I believe in investing most people are their own worst enemy . The rolodex of choices like options margins leverage covered calls cash secured puts CFDs complex rebalancing chasing the next hot stock finding the next NVDA the list goes on all this are mostly rooted in greed you want to beat the market and optimise for a few more percentage points or just plain gamble for a big win . If you just do the work for 1015 years and stay put the rest of your life your wealth will compound by itself . Ive seen a chart where youre actually 25 % to becoming millionaire at 100K and 54 % to a millionaire at 300k . All because of compounding ."

The confusion will be so palpable that one may wonder why the user didn't just use chatgpt or Gemini to answer the question quicker. In turn showing that perhaps LLMs are, in fact, a bubble. Because while the user had access to a quick answer, they chose not to use it. Stupid circular money. There seems to be an uptick in the number of posts about Satya Nadella talking about AI slop.

There will be a post where the user is going to be quite confused and distraught . About the current valuation of TSLA . Because it simply makes no_sense . The confusion will be so palpable that one may wonder why the user didnt just use chatgpt or Gemini to answer the question quicker . In turn showing that perhaps LLMs are in fact a bubble . Because while the user had access to a quick answer they chose not_to use it . Stupid circular money . There seems to be an uptick in the number of posts about Satya Nadella talking about AI slop . I see that being woven into bubble narrative quite soon here in the investing subreddits . Well that about sums up my predictions for posts on Reddit for this coming Monday . What are yours"

      "selftext": "Howdy all, To begin the year, doing a review of the family's investment profile and looking for pointers. 48M and 43F, both actively working and trying to do our best to invest for long term prosperity, mostly focused on growth via ETFs / mutual funds, with small dashes of some dividend yielding stocks / reits. Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely. The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable / tax advantaged accounts, I have the following to mull over... * Taxable vs retirement: * 39% taxable * 61% retirement * Across all those, ratio of holding types: * 95% equities * 5% cash / treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence. Let the critiquing / discussion begin (if this is not boring or out of suitable questions). Thx in advance!",

      "selftext": "Noted that this is anectdotal, but I was reading this article about California new rules for refunds. Somewhat interesting. [ Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you. At 7 p.m., we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late, and it will be 7:25 instead of 7:05. At 7:28, I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 7:15 still? So, I call the Dasher, they tell me that their tablet broke, no one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed. I text Doordash - no response ever. Then I call Doordash. I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund. I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesn't get picked up. The rep can't help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor. The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors, I'm 34th in line so I will get a call back. I ask when. They said it could be 2 hours. A company worth $100B market cap that has invested $billions in technology that cannot: manage a simple driver change, manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice, cannot manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours... This is systematic. Nothing works across their enterprise after billions spent. Of course, this is just my issue, but I've seen this before. This would never have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything. I know this is a vent, but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law, how others will follow, and if Dash has any management capability to improve. I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed. \"This happens all the time with Doordash\" were not the words an investor or customer would want to hear.",

Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you . At 7 p.m. we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late and it will be 725 instead of 705 . At 728 I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 715 still So I call the Dasher they tell me that their tablet broke no_one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed . I text Doordash no_response ever . Then I call Doordash . I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund . I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesnt get picked up . The rep cant help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor . The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors Im 34th in line so I will get a call back . I ask when . They said it could be 2 hours . A company worth $ 100B market cap that has invested $ billions in technology that can not manage a simple driver change manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice can not manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours ... This is systematic . Nothing_works across their enterprise after billions spent . Of course this is just my issue but Ive seen this before . This would never_have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything . I know this is a vent but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law how others will follow and if Dash has any management capability to improve . I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed . This happens all the time with Doordash were not_the words an investor or customer would want to hear ."

      "selftext": "I keep seeing people say “this feels just like the dot com bubble” whenever the NASDAQ comes up, and I get why. Prices are high, tech runs the show, and everyone’s talking about AI. But the reality today is very different than 2000, especially when you look under the hood. Back in the dot com bubble, a huge chunk of companies had no profits at all. A lot of them didn’t even have real products. They were valued based on clicks, website traffic, or just the idea that “the internet is the future.” When money got tighter, those companies had nothing to fall back on. They ran out of cash and went to zero. Today’s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon. These aren’t hype machines. They generate real profits every single quarter. Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then. Another big difference is how important tech is now. In 2000, tech was optional. Today it’s infrastructure. Cloud services, chips, software, and data centers run basically everything. Governments, hospitals, banks, and the military all depend on this stuff. That demand doesn’t disappear just because the economy slows down. That doesn’t mean stocks can’t drop. They absolutely can. High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility. But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down, not companies blowing up. The dot com crash was about fake businesses failing. Today’s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively. That’s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines. Not saying buy or sell. Just saying this isn’t 2000 all over again. My advice is to stay in the market and continue to dollar cost average!",

Prices are high tech runs the show and everyone ’ s talking about AI . But the reality today is very different than 2000 especially when you look under the hood . Back in the dot com bubble a huge chunk of companies had no_profits at all . A lot of them didn ’ t even have real products . They were valued based on clicks website traffic or just the idea that “ the internet is the future. ” When money got tighter those companies had nothing_to fall back on . They ran out of cash and went to zero . Today ’ s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money . Apple Microsoft Google Nvidia Meta Amazon . These aren ’ t hype machines . They generate real profits every single quarter . Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then . Another big difference is how important tech is now . In 2000 tech was optional . Today it ’ s infrastructure . Cloud services chips software and data centers run basically everything . Governments hospitals banks and the military all depend on this stuff . That demand doesn ’ t disappear just because the economy slows down . That doesn ’ t mean stocks can ’ t drop . They absolutely can . High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility . But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down not_companies blowing up . The dot com crash was about fake businesses failing . Today ’ s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively . That ’ s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines . Not_saying buy or sell . Just saying this isn ’ t 2000 all over again . My advice is to stay in the market and continue to dollar cost average"

      "title": "Oil Prices Up, But Can Exxon and Chevron Keep Up? What’s Your Take?",
      "selftext": "Oil prices have been climbing recently, and both Exxon and Chevron have seen their stock prices follow suit. But, I’ve been wondering short term gains are great, but can these two stocks really sustain long term growth just based on rising oil prices? On top of that, with more countries ramping up support for renewable energy, will the big oil players like these be left behind? Personally, I think that while higher oil prices will boost profits, especially for companies like XOM and CVX, the growing push for renewable energy is something that can’t be ignored. With the Biden administration pushing for more clean energy initiatives and Europe speeding up its green transition, traditional oil companies are definitely facing more pressure. I’ve also noticed that Chevron and Exxon are trying to adapt by investing in renewables, but they’re still mostly dependent on oil and gas. Do you guys think this transition will actually work out, or is it just a “temporary” shift? Can they really keep up with the demand for greener alternatives? And let’s not forget about the risk of oil prices dropping. When oil prices fell last year, both XOM and CVX felt the impact. How do you guys see the effect of oil price fluctuations on their long term performance? Right now, holding these might look good short term, but do you think they can keep growing in the long run? What’s your take do you think these stocks are still a good hold, or have they become overpriced at this point? Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",

      "selftext_processed": "Oil prices have been climbing recently and both Exxon and Chevron have seen their stock prices follow suit . But I ’ ve been wondering short term gains are great but can these two stocks really sustain long term growth just based on rising oil prices On top of that with more countries ramping up support for renewable energy will the big oil players like these be left behind Personally I think that while higher oil prices will boost profits especially for companies like XOM and CVX the growing push for renewable energy is something that can ’ t be ignored . With the Biden administration pushing for more clean energy initiatives and Europe speeding up its green transition traditional oil companies are definitely facing more pressure . I ’ ve also noticed that Chevron and Exxon are trying to adapt by investing in renewables but they ’ re still mostly dependent on oil and gas . Do you guys think this transition will actually work out or is it just a “ temporary ” shift Can they really keep up with the demand for greener alternatives And let ’ s not_forget about the risk of oil prices dropping . When oil prices fell last year both XOM and CVX felt the impact . How do you guys see the effect of oil price fluctuations on their long term performance Right now holding these might look good short term but do you think they can keep growing in the long run What ’ s your take do you think these stocks are still a good hold or have they become overpriced at this point Would love to hear everyone ’ s thoughts"

      "selftext": "Tesla just reported Q4 deliveries of 418,227 vehicles, missing the market's expectations of 440,907, a 5.2% drop. Full year deliveries came in at 1.64 million, down 8.6% YoY, with an estimate of 1.6 million. The Q4 miss can be attributed to a few key factors: the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, the aging product line (Model 3/Y still lead but are lacking major updates), increased competition in Europe and China, and some brand image issues. However, the energy storage business has been a bright spot, with deployments hitting 14.2 GWh in Q4 (up 29% YoY) and a total of 46.7 GWh for the year. Demand for Megapack and Powerwall remains strong, which is definitely a positive for the energy division. From a technical perspective, the stock is in a bearish environment, with support at 440 and resistance at 460. The bullish signal at 460 from December 30 has pretty much played out, and the stock has recently dipped below the 440 support. If it doesn’t reclaim 440, it’s likely to fall to 432.5 and 420. If the stock reclaims 440 next week, we could see a rebound, testing the 445, 450, and 460 resistance levels. However, unless it breaks 460 and re-enters a bullish environment, any rally could be short-lived. For those looking to go long, it might be better to wait until the stock breaks and holds above 460 before jumping in. Entering in a bearish market might leave you stuck in a losing position.",

      "selftext": "My take on Tesla (TSLA) here: a short‑term rebound early next week (Mon–Tue) looks pretty likely. Today’s volume was actually decent, which matters. This setup reminds me a lot of last year’s Christmas period， low holiday liquidity was used to push the price down, then volume came back starting Jan 2, 2025, and the stock rebounded shortly after. Technically, TSLA is now pulling back toward an important psychological anchor， the dip area after the Dec 8 peak, which is also a heavy volume / cost basis zone. If price stabilizes around this level, a short‑term bounce over the next few sessions wouldn’t be surprising. That said, I don’t think we’re getting a repeat of last January’s massive run. The structure is very different: The main cost‑basis cluster has moved much higher than last year A large portion of shares are now locked up by longs Upside momentum isn’t as clean as it was in early 2025 So my view: Short‑term bounce? Likely. Straight‑line January melt‑up like last year? Very unlikely. Curious how others are positioned here， trading the bounce, or staying on the sidelines until structure improves?",

      "selftext_processed": "My take on Tesla TSLA here a short‑term rebound early next week Mon–Tue looks pretty likely . Today ’ s volume was actually decent which matters . This setup reminds me a lot of last year ’ s Christmas period， low holiday liquidity was used to push the price down then volume came back starting Jan 2 2025 and the stock rebounded shortly after . Technically TSLA is now pulling back toward an important psychological anchor， the dip area after the Dec 8 peak which is also a heavy volume cost basis zone . If price stabilizes around this level a short‑term bounce over the next few sessions wouldn ’ t be surprising . That said I don ’ t think we ’ re getting a repeat of last January ’ s massive run . The structure is very different The main cost‑basis cluster has moved much higher than last year A large portion of shares are now locked up by longs Upside momentum isn ’ t as clean as it was in early 2025 So my view Short‑term bounce Likely . Straight‑line January melt‑up like last year Very unlikely . Curious how others are positioned here， trading the bounce or staying on the sidelines until structure improves"

      "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record. Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion. SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019. Wall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood. SpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year. Analyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink. Lin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. “In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. To be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. A bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.",

      "selftext_processed": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record . Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company ’ s plans to go public this year were “ accurate. ” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $ 800 billion . SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $ 1.5 trillion when it hits the public market . That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019 . Wall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors . Baron Capital ’ s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company . On top of that SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund . It ’ s also the biggest holding in the ARK ’ s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood . SpaceX has shown leadership in the lowearth orbit or LEO market according to Jefferies . SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year an increase of more than 30 % from the prior quarter and about 70 % from a year ago the bank found . The company launched more than 3200 satellites in 2025 a new yearly record and increase of more than 60 % from the prior year . Analyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX ’ s launch volume is “ accelerating ” while competitor Amazon . Leo is “ lagging ” despite entering a stable launch phase . Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk ’ s Starlink . Lin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit alltime highs in the near future . SpaceX ’ s outlook is bright for another reason data centers . Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space Lin said . Space data centers are expected to “ drive ” the total addressable market for the LEO sector the analyst added . “ In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth ’ s energy bottleneck the topic of space data centers has gained momentum ” Lin told clients . To be sure Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space . However Yu said he ’ s “ encouraged ” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this . “ There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics ” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month . A bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk . His controversial $ 1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year ."

Are there any advantages or disadvantages to keeping ETF holdings and individual stock holdings in separate accounts at the same brokerage? I have six taxable brokerage accounts total, at three different brokerages (Chase, Citi, and E-Trade), opened to receive a cash bonus by depositing X amount of money and leaving it there for 90 days. Three are in my name, and three are in my wife's name. Now that the 90 days has passed, my stocks and one ETF are consolidated into a single account at E-Trade. The last time I looked into making some or all of the accounts joint accounts, it seemed like a lot of paperwork, so I decided against doing so. I'm revisiting the question as I get my finances ready for a new year. Hence, Question 1. Any thoughts on either question?",

Three are in my name and three are in my wifes name . Now that the 90 days has passed my stocks and one ETF are consolidated into a single account at ETrade . The last time I looked into making some or all of the accounts joint accounts it seemed like a lot of paperwork so I decided against doing so . Im revisiting the question as I get my finances ready for a new year . Hence Question 1 . Any thoughts on either question"

      "selftext": "SMR (NuScale Power) is having a strong day, but unless I missed something, there’s no obvious company specific catalyst behind the move. This looks more like a broader nuclear sector rotation than a sudden fundamental re rating of SMR itself. A few quick thoughts: The nuclear theme keeps coming back AI, data centers, and grid reliability all support the long term narrative. SMR is still early stage, with long timelines and real execution risk. Historically, SMR tends to move fast when sentiment turns, and cool off just as quickly. Not saying today’s move is wrong just that it feels sentiment driven rather than fundamentals driven. Curious how others here are thinking about it: Long nuclear as a long term infrastructure play, or just trading the volatility? If you want exposure, do you prefer SMR, or broader plays like uranium miners / ETFs? Interested to hear different views.",

This looks more like a broader nuclear sector rotation than a sudden fundamental re rating of SMR itself . A few quick thoughts The nuclear theme keeps coming back AI data centers and grid reliability all support the long term narrative . SMR is still early stage with long timelines and real execution risk . Historically SMR tends to move fast when sentiment turns and cool off just as quickly . Not_saying today ’ s move is wrong just that it feels sentiment driven rather than fundamentals driven . Curious how others here are thinking about it Long nuclear as a long term infrastructure play or just trading the volatility If you want exposure do you prefer SMR or broader plays like uranium miners ETFs Interested to hear different views ."

But can $470 billion in Capex translate into profits? META: Acquiring Manus AI and a 26% boost in AI advertising revenue are solid moves. But Reality Labs lost $4.4 billion in Q1, and Capex is accelerating significantly ahead of 2025. Is this investing in the future or just passing the buck? TSM: I feel it's the most stable. 72% market share, 2nm premium of 10-20%, CoWoS capacity up 66% and fully booked. But watch out for a major pitfall in 2026: midterm election year. Historical data is clear: midterm election years average a 10% pullback, with Q2-Q3 being the most dangerous. Which stocks are you bullish on for 2026? Care to share your thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Here is my proposed allocation 2026 and how I rebalanced when the market re-opened today. I am selling all VOO/VTI and replacing with them looking toward a future in 2026 with a weaker dollar and a much larger US debt. SMH is my high risk bet with a 15% trailing stop (and it cranked +3% today so far), I think SMH is the play for 2026 but don't want to be the bag holder when AI purchasing grinds to a halt and it will at some point. **2026 Portfolio Allocation** 30% SCHG (Growth), **US Growth:** Cash-rich monopolies that survive high rates. 20% SCHD (Value), **US Quality:** Companies with real profits, avoiding the \"zombies\" in VTI. 15% SMH (Semis), **High Risk Bet** in the AI buildout 15% Gold (GLD), **The Insurance:** Protection against US dollar \"debasement.\" 10% Int'l (VYMI), **The Escape:** Exposure to non-US economies. 10% Cash (SGOV), **The Parking:** Earns 5% yield while waiting for volatility, keeping any cash here and will DCA in monthly. Because of how US Debt is shifting, buying VTI is not sufficient anymore. I can't prove it but I think the long-term play for the USA is to try and herd everyone into crypto for a pump-n-dump in an effort to pay down the debt. Consider this [The Quiet, Fateful Shift in Who’s Buying America’s Debt]( I named this the \"Gretsky retail investment strategy\", because I am trying to skate to where the puck is going, not where it is today or the path it has been on. No disrespect to the Boggle-Heads but take a hard look at \"VOO and chill\" strategy 5-years from now vs. this allocation. I await your flaming arrows.",

SMH is my high risk bet with a 15 % trailing stop and it cranked 3 % today so far I think SMH is the play for 2026 but dont want to be the bag holder when AI purchasing grinds to a halt and it will at some point . 2026 Portfolio Allocation 30 % SCHG Growth US Growth Cashrich monopolies that survive high rates . 20 % SCHD Value US Quality Companies with real profits avoiding the zombies in VTI . 15 % SMH Semis High Risk Bet in the AI buildout 15 % Gold GLD The Insurance Protection against US dollar debasement . 10 % Intl VYMI The Escape Exposure to nonUS economies . 10 % Cash SGOV The Parking Earns 5 % yield while waiting for volatility keeping any cash here and will DCA in monthly . Because of how US Debt is shifting buying VTI is not_sufficient anymore . I cant prove it but I think the longterm play for the USA is to try and herd everyone into crypto for a pumpndump in an effort to pay down the debt . Consider this The Quiet Fateful Shift in Who ’ s Buying America ’ s Debt I named this the Gretsky retail investment strategy because I am trying to skate to where the puck is going not_where it is today or the path it has been on . No_disrespect to the BoggleHeads but take a hard look at VOO and chill strategy 5years from now vs. this allocation . I await your flaming arrows ."

I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.",

Like do they have some inner circle network that can get info from large car retails in US, Canada, UK etc etc? OR are those professional investment firms just like us and they have no idea how the sales trend is and just rely on news articles and then react after the news hit?",

Okay thats fair . But my question is do those professional investment firms who invest hundreds of millions of dollars in stocksoptions have any method or intel on the sales trend before the company publicly shares it Like do they have some inner circle network that can get info from large car retails in US Canada UK etc etc OR are those professional investment firms just like us and they have no_idea how the sales trend is and just rely on news articles and then react after the news hit"

      "selftext": "First trading day of the year, which means maxing out my Roth IRA, but I have basically ZERO international exposure. I started this Roth IRA back in 2017 and for that first year I dumped everything into VFIFX (2050 Target Date Fund). 2018 to present I have been putting it all into VTSAX because I realized I don't need bonds quite yet. Now as I'm learning more I realize I should probably diversify more to include a greater % of international stocks. The breakdown of the target date fund is around 55 US / 36 INT / 6 US Bond / 2 INT Bond, but this is currently only about 15% of my Roth IRA portfolio. The other 85% is VTSAX. When I started this Roth IRA for whatever reason I chose the mutual funds over the ETF equivalents (maybe ETF wasn't offered then?), and now for my 2026 contribution I'm only given a choice to contribute to another Vanguard Mutual Fund, my 2050 Target Date Fund, or my VTSAX fund. If I wanted to throw this $7500 into an international fund, which should I use? Most of the funds I'm aware of are ETFs, and it doesn't seem I can contribute to an ETF, only Mutual Fund. Should I put it all into VTIAX (Total International Stock Market Fund) then? That would only bring my international allocation up to about 12% within this IRA. Can I transact within the IRAs existing shares to trade some VTSAX shares to International Shares? Or maybe better to get rid of the 2050 Target Date fund shares in favor of International Shares, because that would also ditch the bonds for now? I also see there is an (irreversible option) to convert my mutual fund shares to the ETF equivalents, but I'm not sure if that's worthwhile in this case. FWIW - the Roth IRA sits around $100k (86k VTSAX & 14k VFIFX). I plan on working another 25-30 years, and as a public employee will be looking to start a 403b and then a taxable brokerage account this year. So I suppose another option would be to leave the Roth allocation as is, put the 7500 into more VTSAX, and then start off the other accounts with heavier international exposure? Any and all advice is welcome, thanks.",

While the admins appreciated the submission, it wasn't approved, so I'm posting it here: **Basic Overview** Six Flags Entertainment Corp (NYSE: $FUN) is a special turnaround case currently trading, what I believe undeservedly, at pandemic lows. Before the pandemic, the last time it traded at this price was in 2011. This suggests that the market believes $FUN is in a terminal decline on the brink of bankruptcy. On paper, this might be understandable: Their TTM income is -472M, they have a total debt of nearly $5B, and a market cap of $1.87B. However, investors are paying 10x on EV/EBITDA, suggesting they might be optimistic about the company's future, and the company is giving guidance that EV/EBITDA is 6x, normalized, implying value. Six Flags has massive brand recognition. Even if you've never been to Six Flags before, most Americans know about Six Flags and likely know somebody who has been to one in their lifetime. Six Flags Entertainment also owns theme parks that aren't under their \"Six Flags\" name, so there are many people that go to their local park not necessarily aware they're attending a Six Flags Entertainment park. However, their brand hasn't changed much over the last 30+ years, and its reputation isn't the best. Former-CEO Selim Bassoul said the park became a \"cheap day-care center for teenagers\". The food isn't high quality, the parks and amenities are dirty, and there's a perception of lower safety (despite that not being statistically true). Wealthier families tend to favor flying to Disney or Universal over regional Six Flags trips. A possible dark horse is the company's unutilized real estate asset base. They sit on a ton of real estate, a lot of it is unutilized, therefore not generating revenue (or not being monetized in a significant way). A 2022 article from Land & Buildings Investment Management claimed that Six Flags owned property in 17 of its parks \"worth more than the stock value of the company\". In 2022, FUN traded at between $40-60/share. According to Six Flags' 2024 Form 10-K, several parks are on land that is leased, implying that the land is already monetized, but what's even more interesting is that there's at least 2,070 acres of identifiable surplus land, probably more. This unutilized land can be used for hotels, restaurants, shops, and more pleasures beyond the typical theme park. If it were me, I'd quickly turn the lowest value land into a solar farm for the park. **JANA Partners Investment** In October of 2025, JANA Partners took a 9% stake in $FUN, approximately $200M. JANA Partners are \"activist investors\". Their entire model is to do extensive research to identify undervalued companies, collaborate with them to create asymmetric upside, then get out when their job is done. JANA's most notable investments in the last decade: 1. Whole Foods: 8.8% stake, pushed for board changes and tech upgrades. Their pressure led to Amazon's acquisition for $13.7B. 2. PetSmart: 10% stake, pushed for sale due to poor performance and sold to BC Partners for $8.7B. 3. ConAgra: 7.2% stake, pushed for board changes and operational improvements. Added former Nestle CEO and Walgreens executive to the board. 4. Tiffany & Co.: 5.1% stake, appointed 3 new directors and improved brand strategy and governance. 5. Pinnacle Foods: 9.1% stake, pushed for cost cuts and strategic changes. Pinnacle was acquired by ConAgre for $8.1B. Other activist investments include Qualcomm, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Walgreens Boot Alliance, Apache, Safeway, Ashland, McGraw Hill, Pinterest, and more. Many people may have seen the headlines recently about the legendary, American Football tight-end, Travis Kelce's investment in FUN. He is also engaged to global music icon, Taylor Swift. Travis' investment was facilitated by JANA Partners. Aside from his legendary football status, he also has a podcast with his brother, another legendary football player. It's clear that JANA plans to leverage Kelce and his relations as a modern brand anchor, bridging sports and pop-culture among a younger demographic. His and his family's ability to reach the younger generation is insurmountable by nobody else in the world, in my opinion. **Turnaround Implementation and Difficulties** The goals JANA listed included: revamping marketing/branding, improving technology and guest experience, assessing leadership and governance, reviewing potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities. JANA's managing partner, Scott Ostfeld, said there's \"substantial opportunity to drive improved park attendance and brand engagement through a re-energizing of its marketing and branding, emphasizing guest experience.\" Their primary goal will likely be to fix Six Flag's reputation. I suspect they'll increase park prices (maybe dynamic pricing) and justify it by offering more premium food, app-based passes and ordering, better atmosphere, less crowding, cleaner parks, more security, and generally a more premium feel that still costs less than Disney and Universal. I also believe they'll rebrand to a more family-friendly park, as opposed to a make-everyone-scream model. They will also leverage as much of that extra 2,000+ acres as possible. According to TEA (The Themed Entertainment Association) and AECOM (Theme Index/Museum Index), large, North American theme parks have only seen marginal growth in the last decade, suggesting the market is mature. What this means for Six Flags Entertainment is that the path to revenue is efficiency, monetization, and capital discipline, not so much growth, but a successful rebrand will likely bring more people to the park. Personally, when I attended Six Flags Great America in the mid 2000s (I had to look this up), a day ticket was $59. TODAY it's $59! Inflation adjusted, the ticket price today should be about $100. At the risk of deviating from analysis, that's insane. I'm concerned that entertainment is evermore fleeting as we become consumed by 10 second Instagram reels. Disney World continuously proves me wrong on this. $FUN was recently named in a securities class action lawsuit related to merger disclosures around under-investment. These cases aren't uncommon after large, underperforming mergers and typically focus on historical disclosures rather than current operating economics. While the outcome and cost are uncertain, settlements in similar cases have usually been manageable relative to cash flow and often covered by insurance. Importantly, this isn’t a new fundamental problem so much as a symptom of past governance issues, exactly the kind of situation activist investors like JANA look for. At worst, it likely slows the turnaround timeline; it doesn’t change the core question of whether the business can improve margins, reduce debt, and earn a higher valuation over several years. JANA has not yet publicly detailed a timeline or financial targets and metrics, but based on their track record, I suspect they're looking at a \\~3-4yr time horizon. Estimating a share price by then will be wildly speculative, but $FUN was just over $70/share in 2017, and that was not because they were doing things better than what they could do with JANA's turnaround plan. The catalyst would be the Board+JANA's release of the full turnaround plan. That plan would be comprehensive, and I suspect will come out Q1 or Q2 2026. That plan should include everything I previously mentioned in monetary detail, with debt-payoff expectations, pricing changes, detailed rebranding plan, capex and leverage of existing land, executive leadership changes, and asset sales. This is when the real spotlight will be put on Six Flags Entertainment. After that, the plan needs to be proven. Bankruptcy risk is non-trivial but contingent on a confluence of (re)-operational failure, macro downturn, and refinancing stress. **I have a small percentage of my portfolio in a long-position on $FUN**",

      "selftext_processed": "I submitted my thesis over at Value Investors Club which is hypercritical of writeups . While the admins appreciated the submission it wasnt approved so Im posting it here Basic Overview Six Flags Entertainment Corp NYSE $ FUN is a special turnaround case currently trading what I believe undeservedly at pandemic lows . Before the pandemic the last time it traded at this price was in 2011 . This suggests that the market believes $ FUN is in a terminal decline on the brink of bankruptcy . On paper this might be understandable Their TTM income is 472M they have a total debt of nearly $ 5B and a market cap of $ 1.87B . However investors are paying 10x on EVEBITDA suggesting they might be optimistic about the companys future and the company is giving guidance that EVEBITDA is 6x normalized implying value . Six Flags has massive brand recognition . Even if youve never_been to Six Flags before most Americans know about Six Flags and likely know somebody who has been to one in their lifetime . Six Flags Entertainment also owns theme parks that arent under their Six Flags name so there are many people that go to their local park not_necessarily aware theyre attending a Six Flags Entertainment park . However their brand hasnt changed much over the last 30 years and its reputation isnt the best . FormerCEO Selim Bassoul said the park became a cheap daycare center for teenagers . The food isnt high quality the parks and amenities are dirty and theres a perception of lower safety despite that not_being statistically true . Wealthier families tend to favor flying to Disney or Universal over regional Six Flags trips . A possible dark horse is the companys unutilized real estate asset base . They sit on a ton of real estate a lot of it is unutilized therefore not_generating revenue or not_being monetized in a significant way . A 2022 article from Land Buildings Investment Management claimed that Six Flags owned property in 17 of its parks worth more than the stock value of the company . In 2022 FUN traded at between $ 4060share . According to Six Flags 2024 Form 10K several parks are on land that is leased implying that the land is already monetized but whats even more interesting is that theres at least 2070 acres of identifiable surplus land probably more . This unutilized land can be used for hotels restaurants shops and more pleasures beyond the typical theme park . If it were me Id quickly turn the lowest value land into a solar farm for the park . JANA Partners Investment In October of 2025 JANA Partners took a 9 % stake in $ FUN approximately $ 200M . JANA Partners are activist investors . Their entire model is to do extensive research to identify undervalued companies collaborate with them to create asymmetric upside then get out when their job is done . JANAs most notable investments in the last decade 1 . Whole Foods 8.8 % stake pushed for board changes and tech upgrades . Their pressure led to Amazons acquisition for $ 13.7B . 2 . PetSmart 10 % stake pushed for sale due to poor performance and sold to BC Partners for $ 8.7B . 3 . ConAgra 7.2 % stake pushed for board changes and operational improvements . Added former Nestle CEO and Walgreens executive to the board . 4 . Tiffany Co. 5.1 % stake appointed 3 new directors and improved brand strategy and governance . 5 . Pinnacle Foods 9.1 % stake pushed for cost cuts and strategic changes . Pinnacle was acquired by ConAgre for $ 8.1B . Other activist investments include Qualcomm BristolMyers Squibb Walgreens Boot Alliance Apache Safeway Ashland McGraw Hill Pinterest and more . Many people may have seen the headlines recently about the legendary American Football tightend Travis Kelces investment in FUN . He is also engaged to global music icon Taylor Swift . Travis investment was facilitated by JANA Partners . Aside from his legendary football status he also has a podcast with his brother another legendary football player . Its clear that JANA plans to leverage Kelce and his relations as a modern brand anchor bridging sports and popculture among a younger demographic . His and his familys ability to reach the younger generation is insurmountable by nobody_else in the world in my opinion . Turnaround Implementation and Difficulties The goals JANA listed included revamping marketingbranding improving technology and guest experience assessing leadership and governance reviewing potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities . JANAs managing partner Scott Ostfeld said theres substantial opportunity to drive improved park attendance and brand engagement through a reenergizing of its marketing and branding emphasizing guest experience . Their primary goal will likely be to fix Six Flags reputation . I suspect theyll increase park prices maybe dynamic pricing and justify it by offering more premium food appbased passes and ordering better atmosphere less crowding cleaner parks more security and generally a more premium feel that still costs less than Disney and Universal . I also believe theyll rebrand to a more familyfriendly park as opposed to a makeeveryonescream model . They will also leverage as much of that extra 2000 acres as possible . According to TEA The Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM Theme IndexMuseum Index large North American theme parks have only seen marginal growth in the last decade suggesting the market is mature . What this means for Six Flags Entertainment is that the path to revenue is efficiency monetization and capital discipline not_so much growth but a successful rebrand will likely bring more people to the park . Personally when I attended Six Flags Great America in the mid 2000s I had to look this up a day ticket was $ 59 . TODAY its $ 59 Inflation adjusted the ticket price today should be about $ 100 . At the risk of deviating from analysis thats insane . Im concerned that entertainment is evermore fleeting as we become consumed by 10 second Instagram reels . Disney World continuously proves me wrong on this . $ FUN was recently named in a securities class action lawsuit related to merger disclosures around underinvestment . These cases arent uncommon after large underperforming mergers and typically focus on historical disclosures rather than current operating economics . While the outcome and cost are uncertain settlements in similar cases have usually been manageable relative to cash flow and often covered by insurance . Importantly this isn ’ t a new fundamental problem so much as a symptom of past governance issues exactly the kind of situation activist investors like JANA look for . At worst it likely slows the turnaround timeline it doesn ’ t change the core question of whether the business can improve margins reduce debt and earn a higher valuation over several years . JANA has not_yet publicly detailed a timeline or financial targets and metrics but based on their track record I suspect theyre looking at a 34yr time horizon . Estimating a share price by then will be wildly speculative but $ FUN was just over $ 70share in 2017 and that was not_because they were doing things better than what they could do with JANAs turnaround plan . The catalyst would be the BoardJANAs release of the full turnaround plan . That plan would be comprehensive and I suspect will come out Q1 or Q2 2026 . That plan should include everything I previously mentioned in monetary detail with debtpayoff expectations pricing changes detailed rebranding plan capex and leverage of existing land executive leadership changes and asset sales . This is when the real spotlight will be put on Six Flags Entertainment . After that the plan needs to be proven . Bankruptcy risk is nontrivial but contingent on a confluence of reoperational failure macro downturn and refinancing stress . I have a small percentage of my portfolio in a longposition on $ FUN"

There’s some pretty solid DD over on the uranium squeeze sub, and I’ve heard a lot of people talking about this lately. Most definitely not an area I’m well versed in though. Seems like an area of the nuclear energy trade that hasn’t gotten a ton of attention on this sub, though the stocks are doing great. Wondering if a mature player like CCJ is still a decent buy in this market, and maybe better than the super crowded trades like oklo and nuscale.",

Seems like an area of the nuclear energy trade that hasn ’ t gotten a ton of attention on this sub though the stocks are doing great . Wondering if a mature player like CCJ is still a decent buy in this market and maybe better than the super crowded trades like oklo and nuscale ."

      "selftext": "Hello everyone! For background, I am almost 19yo. I've been working at Walmart for a little over 6 months as a Pharmacy Technician while I pursue my undergraduate studies that will hopefully land me in pharmacy school. As for my \"portfolio\" I have invested in VOO and NVDA through vanguard but no insane amount or anything contributed (roughly 1k). Considering I haven't hit my 1 year anniversary, Walmart doesn't match my 401k yet but I have still been contributing 6%. Contributions to date: $503 Current balance: $475 (I guess that means it went down??) - Question 1 being: Should I wait to keep investing until they match? - Question 2: Should I invest in Walmart stocks through my associate app? If so should I do the max contribution? ($70 per paycheck for the max amount of matched contribution at 15% aka $10.50) Or am I overdoing it and need to just save this money in my high-yield towards college. (I am currently managing paying off my undergrad tuition just fine, but pharmacy school can be as much as 26k a year for 4 years)",

The anonymity thing that makes reddit great for most stuff makes it terrible for investing advice because there's zero accountability, someone can write a 10 paragraph bull case on some stock while secretly holding puts and you'd never know, and it happens constantly with pump and dumps and meme stocks. I spend way more time now in places where people actually connect their brokerages and show real positions, and the difference in quality is night and day honestly, people think twice before hyping garbage when everyone can see they only own 3 shares, I've been mostly hanging out in blossom lately and the discussions feel way more honest because of it. Maybe I'm being too harsh but at this point if you won't show your positions I'm just gonna assume you don't actually believe what you're saying, does anyone else feel this way or am I turning into a paranoid old man.",

The anonymity thing that makes reddit great for most stuff makes it terrible for investing advice because theres zero accountability someone can write a 10 paragraph bull case on some stock while secretly holding puts and youd never_know and it happens constantly with pump and dumps and meme stocks . I spend way more time now in places where people actually connect their brokerages and show real positions and the difference in quality is night and day honestly people think twice before hyping garbage when everyone can see they only own 3 shares Ive been mostly hanging out in blossom lately and the discussions feel way more honest because of it . Maybe Im being too harsh but at this point if you wont show your positions Im just gon na assume you dont actually believe what youre saying does anyone else feel this way or am I turning into a paranoid old man ."

      "selftext": "In early December 2025, I performed a back door ROTH for the first time last month. I opened up a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and deposited $8k (I am 50 yo) into the settlement account (which was SPAXX). As soon as the system allowed me to do it (I was checking daily, multiple times a day … it took a couple of days), I changed the settlement position to Cash FDIC deposit), and then I transferred the $8k into my ROTH IRA. The traditional IRA showed 0, which is what it should be. All good for the past month. Today I saw there is $1.21 in the settlement account of my traditional IRA. I guess the money must have earned interest during the 1-2 days it was sitting in there. I obviously don’t want any money sitting in my traditional IRA. What should I do? I’m actually thinking I will perform another backdoor Roth, contributing $8498.79 and then immediately move ALL in the funds in the account to my Roth IRA. Thoughts?",

As soon as the system allowed me to do it I was checking daily multiple times a day … it took a couple of days I changed the settlement position to Cash FDIC deposit and then I transferred the $ 8k into my ROTH IRA . The traditional IRA showed 0 which is what it should be . All good for the past month . Today I saw there is $ 1.21 in the settlement account of my traditional IRA . I guess the money must have earned interest during the 12 days it was sitting in there . I obviously don ’ t want any money sitting in my traditional IRA . What should I do I ’ m actually thinking I will perform another backdoor Roth contributing $ 8498.79 and then immediately move ALL in the funds in the account to my Roth IRA . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "2025 ended up being a pretty great year! 47% return for $6,800,000 A decent amount of gains are from selling options, and some great gains on being heavy long on RDDT and GOOG with shares and calls). All in all, I typically have around 30 unique tickers and about 150 positions open at any given time. Those positions can be relatively small, up to hundreds of contracts. Yes, lots of people had better returns in 2025. I’m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges. With the market going up for 8 months straight, my hedges hurt quite a bit. But should a black swan event have occurred, or the market switched to bear mode, I would have done pretty well (especially compared to the market). Here’s to 2026 being a good one as well!",

So how to get in now It seems like all the companies big in the space are either chinese which can be tricky to trade as a westerner or small private startups .

      "selftext": "I have been lurking in here for many years now, and I think its an extraordinary place to find undervalued stocks or great businesses overall, either to trade or to invest in. I have seen it mentioned here before, but even then, maybe 1% of the amount of mentions it truly deserves. this stock is HIMS. I believe (my bad, I mean I KNOW), it is going to potentially triple, or even more, in 2026, and every person here should take a look at it. Lets look at the facts: First of all, their financial statements 1. Revenue has been increasing for many years now, 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024, and expected 2.25b in 2025. Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2. Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4. Buying back shares 5. Great Margins Technicals: It has been on a long-term uptrend since may of 2022, with higher highs, and higher lows. during this time, it has had 10 declines of 30% or more (3 of them 50% or more, including the current one). EACH TIME it declined, it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 65-70$ range. This year, it made its ATH in February at 73$, and it touched the 65-70$ range 4 times, which is now a major resistance range. currently, its at 33 dollars, which is its 3rd 50%+ decline, and 10th decline of 30% or more since may 2022. NOT BUYING right now, does not make ANY SENSE. its had a 100% success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years, and now its no different. It has now made a double bottom, and its already at a pretty nice support level. I believe it has BOTTOMED. Moreover, this year alone, they have announced LABS, Canada expansion, Europe expansion, some acquisitions, Testosterone treatments, and many more to come. Now, just due to technicals its a very easy double from here, BUT, I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026, and this is why: 1. Institutional Ownership - 239m shares. Shares outstanding - 228m Total float of shares - 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT - 67m. this stock is ridiculously shorted, with 0 logic behind it, and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2. Potential NVO partnership, which is a major catalyst if it happens (and I think it will). 3. Rumors about the FDA & HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding. HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility. If this is true, ITS MASSIVE. the potential catalysts + fundamentals + Technicals are saying 1 thing - the stock is going to have a great 2026, and im very shocked it is not the 1# mention here. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, im just sharing my opinion. my position - 6000 shares at 39.76$",

      "selftext_processed": "I have been lurking in here for many years now and I think its an extraordinary place to find undervalued stocks or great businesses overall either to trade or to invest in . I have seen it mentioned here before but even then maybe 1 % of the amount of mentions it truly deserves . this stock is HIMS . I believe my bad I mean I KNOW it is going to potentially triple or even more in 2026 and every person here should take a look at it . Lets look at the facts First of all their financial statements 1 . Revenue has been increasing for many years now 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024 and expected 2.25b in 2025 . Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2 . Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4 . Buying back shares 5 . Great Margins Technicals It has been on a longterm uptrend since may of 2022 with higher highs and higher lows . during this time it has had 10 declines of 30 % or more 3 of them 50 % or more including the current one . EACH TIME it declined it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 6570 $ range . This year it made its ATH in February at 73 $ and it touched the 6570 $ range 4 times which is now a major resistance range . currently its at 33 dollars which is its 3rd 50 % decline and 10th decline of 30 % or more since may 2022 . NOT_BUYING right now does not_make ANY SENSE . its had a 100 % success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years and now its no_different . It has now made a double bottom and its already at a pretty nice support level . I believe it has BOTTOMED . Moreover this year alone they have announced LABS Canada expansion Europe expansion some acquisitions Testosterone treatments and many more to come . Now just due to technicals its a very easy double from here BUT I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026 and this is why 1 . Institutional Ownership 239m shares . Shares outstanding 228m Total float of shares 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT 67m . this stock is ridiculously shorted with 0 logic behind it and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2 . Potential NVO partnership which is a major catalyst if it happens and I think it will . 3 . Rumors about the FDA HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding . HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility . If this is true ITS MASSIVE . the potential catalysts fundamentals Technicals are saying 1 thing the stock is going to have a great 2026 and im very shocked it is not_the 1 mention here . This is NOT_FINANCIAL ADVICE im just sharing my opinion . my position 6000 shares at 39.76 $"

I have a good amount of money split between retirement accounts and a separate brokerage account. However, I would like to start to buy some more individual stock with “play money” that’s less the 1% of my total portfolio. Questions I have for you guys. Obviously tech and AI and tech/ai adjacent fields is on everyone’s radar, but how do you guys go about setting you “buy in” prices for these companies? I guess also just looking for any wisdom or advice. I’m not looking to day trade or make millions in a year. Just tried to pick good anchors, some I see able to grow still and the a few long shots with my horizon being 2-5 + years. I know these are basic questions, so don’t destroy me too hard. I don’t really have other people or friends into investing outside chasing hype companies Thanks \\* edit\\* I guess I should rephrase, how to determine appropriate entry prices for companies.

      "selftext": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick. I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened... The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism. I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\". [The delivery process]( I instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open. **If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.** I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip. # Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer? It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly: 1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000 Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important): ± 200 people / 100.000 **.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.** ( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.) \\----- Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts: Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors). This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that. Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission. So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed): USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.** [Unlocking my full potential]( Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower. Now that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern. # A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter. If you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE. 1. The technical guy who actually knows shit 2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO. This is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China. The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart. The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team. After the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely). The best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit. All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial. # Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of: \"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant) The study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying. So why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive. **WHY?:** * Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups * You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%) * All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis. * A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn. **But most importantly:** * BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS. # Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money. # So Why Are You Bearish? Well I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?: (1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) (2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) Which is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)? I'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation. The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately. Hence I'm buying puts. **NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement. **My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:** EDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.",

      "selftext_processed": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick . I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing_happened ... The problem Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it wont speed up its effects . You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached Llysine amino acid that breaks off in your body using enzymes ... thus creating this slowrelease mechanism . I wasnt discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me the edge . The delivery process I instantly got hit with Writers euphoria some people say they see colors all I saw was a pumpndump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump . Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open . If you havent figured it out yet Im talking about SLS . I will attack this pumpndump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this short trip . Buckle up buckeroos were gon na start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt . cap close to USD 600M . First thing that I ask is who is the customer Its a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 12 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer Acute Myleoid Leukemia . If we look at how many people get it globally were gon na arrive at roughly 1.52.0 persons 100.000 Now lets look at all cancers this will be important ± 200 people 100.000 .... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN . What I didnt realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being . Why am I mentioning all cancers Well its to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pumpndump posts That this is a replacement for Keytruda which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80 % gross margins . But heres the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts Keytruda is allpurpose while the shit that SLS is producing is NOT_You need to be tested for the presence of WT1 antigen which is only done for blood disorderscancers . You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing_about it being usable for this source I know a few doctors . This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100 ... SLS drugs will barely target 1 % of that . Why do I say barely Well because that these drugs are given to specific people ... CDK9 is effective only for people with a certain less common mutation and GPS is given to my understanding to people in remission . So lets do simple math before I make you even more depressed USD 25B 1 % 250M lets be optimistic and say that 80 % are eligible 200M But wait it gets better ... however right now my heart is pumping pupils are needlepoint sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk ... low doses of ketamine . Unlocking my full potential Keytruda gets administered constantly unlike GPS which is like 20 injections . So that 200M you were looking at Yea its probably way lower . Now that weve got over the HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS lets focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEOs marketingdilution pattern . A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter . If youve ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE . 1 . The technical guy who actually knows shit 2 . The bullshitter whos liked but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if hes career driven will become a good CTO . The second one will become CEO . This is true for every profession reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell especially bullshit to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity . Its all a zerosum game . Nobody_wins especially not_the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like whitemonkeys are in China . The CEO SLS is no_different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter . How do you become a master bullshitter Ambiguity . Think of the 1 technical guy he will always be precise in his formulations because he knows what hes talking about . the 2 bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart . The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members read bagholders and MLM leaders parrot the actual but notfactual_message to the masses . Just look up the recent posts on bagholderpnd subreddits for SLS . Its all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team . After the share price jumps high the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion not_including the perpetual warrant inducement plan which alone makes acquisition very unlikely . The best part The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50 % shareholders want to lower his abovestandard pay . And theres a good reason hes getting such high cash bonuses he knows its all bullshit . All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired which is unlikely it will be sold at a discount and not_a premium . Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $ 4 a share ... with constantly increasing share count its amplifying the speed at which the companys valuation grows even though they still havent really presented anything substantial . Lets Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $ 4 Results of the REGAL study were postponed which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of Were still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study . Which is absolutely hilarious . Because it doesnt say anything about SLS specifically yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one it may be but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant The study includes both BAT best available treatment and the SLS drugs . The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones while the SLS patients have already died grim I know . Their argument Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever theyre saying . So why do people think its good news for SLS Because people think they understand statistics when they actually dont . Heck I studied it specialized in it as a mathematician ... and even I will never_dare to say that I fully understand statistics . Reality is that the delay might be negative neutral or positive . WHY Many factors come into patient selection The study isnt the typical lets pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests they come in different cohortsgroups You have high odds of selecting the good group that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment this can be 1015 % All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should which is a very misleading statistic and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people ... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years and that will average out so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not_enough to know if there is a statistical significance . Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis . A small sample size like this is prone to distortions follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not_which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn . But most importantly BAT for AML has significantly improved ... and by significantly I mean really significantly . The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 1012 months . Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS . Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production . Given their current free cash its more than likely that they will need to raise more money . So Why Are You Bearish Well I like to think of it in terms of probability uncertainty specifically conditional probability . Lets denote Pevent A as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening Asks yourself this which probability is higher 1 P Good News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad 2 P Bad News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad Which is more likely to be true 1 2 or 1 2 Im gon na go with the likelihood of bad news as probable ... This doesnt mean that the drug wont work I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no_matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections wont be as high as the current valuation . The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their lifesaving medication out there ... This isnt the age of biotech unfortunately . Hence Im buying puts . NOTE Im not_a biochemist I might be wrong and Im betting only money that Im willing to lose so dont follow blindly do your own DD . Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots . One last thing ... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement . My position is small because Im locked down in other trades sharing mostly because I like to do equity research EDIT To the existing and new bots out there the SLS cult and other believers yes I will double down if the stock price goes up Answering here since I received very nice DM requests ."

Honestly, even at today's level, looking at its P/E ratio and next year's projections, it remains a rare bargain in this AI semiconductor wave.

Honestly even at todays level looking at its PE ratio and next years projections it remains a rare bargain in this AI semiconductor wave .

      "title": "Tesla reports 418,227 deliveries for the fourth quarter, down 16%",
      "selftext": "Tesla posted its fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday. Here are the key numbers: * Total deliveries: 418,227 * Total production: 434,358 Wall Street expected 426,000 deliveries for the quarter, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. In a company-compiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29, Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15% drop from a year earlier to 422,850 vehicles for the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Elon Musk’s EV company reported 495,570 deliveries and production of 459,445 vehicles. Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China’s BYD, South Korea’s Kia and Hyundai, and Volkswagen in Europe. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications. In its energy business, Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter, following a record in the prior period, when it deployed 12.5 GWh. Tesla’s battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities. Sales of Tesla’s cars were impacted by President Donald Trump’s decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30, earlier than previously planned. The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers. Even before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla. After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. Musk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union. Partly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October. However, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September. Shareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass. Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity. While Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025. Tesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there. Some analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters. In a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.” Besides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely. But Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla posted its fourthquarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday . Here are the key numbers Total deliveries 418227 Total production 434358 Wall Street expected 426000 deliveries for the quarter according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount . In a companycompiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29 Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15 % drop from a year earlier to 422850 vehicles for the quarter . In the fourth quarter of 2024 Elon Musk ’ s EV company reported 495570 deliveries and production of 459445 vehicles . Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China ’ s BYD South Korea ’ s Kia and Hyundai and Volkswagen in Europe . Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not_precisely defined in the company ’ s shareholder communications . In its energy business Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter following a record in the prior period when it deployed 12.5 GWh . Tesla ’ s battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities . Sales of Tesla ’ s cars were impacted by President Donald Trump ’ s decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30 earlier than previously planned . The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers . Even before that the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla . After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president ’ s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce . Musk also endorsed Germany ’ s extremist antiimmigrant party AfD and later supported British antiMuslim and antiimmigration activist Tommy Robinson . In recent weeks Musk has called to abolish the European Union . Partly in response to Musk ’ s incendiary rhetoric Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S . The company hasn ’ t fully recovered despite introducing a new more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October . However Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year jumping 40 % in the third quarter reaching a fresh record in midDecember . Musk bought $ 1 billion worth of shares in September . Shareholders approved a new $ 1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company . The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn ’ t pass . Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn ’ t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work and that there are no_limits on his political activity . While Tesla doesn ’ t break out deliveries geographically data from the European Automobile Manufacturers ’ Association ACEA showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025 . Tesla ’ s European registrations fell 39 % in the first 11 months of 2025 while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240 % in Europe . Overall battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025 amounting to around 16 % of all new vehicles sold there . Some analysts project that sales of Tesla ’ s more affordable Model Y standard which the company launched in October will help the company regain ground in coming quarters . In a note last week analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “ is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand Vietnam and Brazil where robust consumer interest could create meaningful longterm upside for Tesla even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers. ” Besides BYD Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely . But Tesla is selling investors on Musk ’ s vision of the future or what he calls “ sustainable abundance ” more than EV sales . That vision includes robotaxis which Musk has promised for years and humanoid robots which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers babysitters crime stoppers and surgeons . Source"

      "selftext": "Hi all. I just started investing last May and really didn’t think much of it. I knew the basics but now my knowledge has really grown to where I feel I have many choices, but I really want to stick to the Boglehead philosophy of investing (I think it’s the most efficient and in many cases, the safest). With how the markets have been recently, my ETFs grew! I am currently only invested in VTI and VXUS. I now make biweekly contributions as well. I plan to stay invested for the long term. I was thinking of also investing in bonds and CDs. However! I’ve heard mixed reviews on this. Some say to not invest in bonds when you’re young because you should be more risky. However, I think the market is going to take a downturn and bonds might be a safe bet. I also was thinking of REITs and some ETFs focused on silver mining (due to the EV explosion). But then this takes away from a boglehead approach and becomes complicated. I also know that REITs are not efficient with taxes since the income from dividends can be high. Plus, I’m just also not experienced with investing. Most of my money is in a terrible HYSA, and while it’s safe, I believe it could be put to work. So, what are your thoughts on REITs and tapping into ETFs that might have some potential due to the EV and AI explosion?",

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

      "selftext": "I’m based in Europe, and this is the main source of my predicament. I am aware on how finding 2/3 ETFs and just accumulate and forget is a hands off approach for a long time investing for non professionals. Rebalancing once a year if needed and carry on. My portfolio has a bit of a mix of single stocks which have done good and don’t plan to liquidate, but I also don’t plan to buy in more besides a very small portion of my budget every now and then when a stock is undervalued and would still be coherent with my long investment horizon. I did some research and figured 3 ETFs that would give me the kind of exposure I feel most comfortable with, but while going through my portfolio ready to do my monthly purchase I realised the commission fee is on the higher end 3/4€) per purchase (IBKR). The three ETFs are XUSA, VWRA and DGRW, and purchasing once a month will erode a portion of my cash in a way I’m not too comfortable with. Question is: is it better to do bulk purchases, 1/2 per year, even if I don’t like cash idling in my account, or is there a set of ETFs which will do that same job without having such commission fee? My main concept is to have a limited exposure to US markets, between 35-45% of my portfolio. I have mutual funds on the side which are 100% focused on Asia and emerging markets and those are held with my bank, so technically not part of this portfolio. Any question that can be useful to have a more “tailored” response is greatly appreciated. Happy 2026!",

      "selftext": "I’ve been looking into TeamViewer AG following the recent price correction, and I believe the market is significantly mispricing this asset. While often dismissed as \"legacy remote support software,\" the underlying financials tell a very different story. 1. Exceptional Profitability Unlike many growth-tech companies, TeamViewer is a cash cow. In 2025, the company maintained an adjusted EBITDA margin of \\~46%. They are consistently generating high free cash flow, which they are aggressively using for share buybacks, effectively increasing earnings per share for remaining holders. 2. Financial Performance (Latest Data) • Revenue Growth: Q3 2025 revenue hit €192M, showing resilience despite a challenging macro environment. Full-year revenue is guided toward €778M - €797M. • Enterprise Pivot: The focus on Enterprise solutions is paying off, with that segment growing 18%. This indicates a successful transition from a consumer/SMB tool to a mission-critical industrial platform (AR/IoT). • Valuation: At current levels, the stock trades at an EV/EBITDA of roughly 7.5x. For a software company with these margins and a leading global brand, this is an entry point usually reserved for distressed industries. 3. The \"Dip\" Opportunity The recent 20% sell-off was triggered by a slight narrowing of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) guidance. In my view, this is a massive overreaction. The core business remains robust, and the company’s expansion into \"Frontline\" (augmented reality for industrial workers) provides a long-term growth catalyst that isn't priced in. Conclusion: TeamViewer is currently priced like a company in terminal decline, yet its margins and enterprise growth suggest a healthy, dominant player. For value-oriented investors looking for tech exposure without the \"bubble\" multiples, $TMV offers a compelling risk/reward profile.",

Last year say an improvement in their free cash flows which say them end the year with around $20 billion. VZ does have a lot of debt. Verizon went through a new leadership change at the end of last year and Verizon seems to be in a rebuild stage. They cut lots of jobs last year which could be a good sign for investors. I know growth will be slow but will there be growth especially if VZ is undervalued? It definitely seems like a good stock to park money in. VZ seem to be leaders in their industry but what is the comparison to AT&T with around a 4% dividend yield. AT&T seem to be in a recovery stage which could see higher growth than VZ and they have merged with Spirit.",

Last year say an improvement in their free cash flows which say them end the year with around $ 20 billion . VZ does have a lot of debt . Verizon went through a new leadership change at the end of last year and Verizon seems to be in a rebuild stage . They cut lots of jobs last year which could be a good sign for investors . I know growth will be slow but will there be growth especially if VZ is undervalued It definitely seems like a good stock to park money in . VZ seem to be leaders in their industry but what is the comparison to ATT with around a 4 % dividend yield . ATT seem to be in a recovery stage which could see higher growth than VZ and they have merged with Spirit ."

      "selftext": "As a gift for my 18th birthday, my parents gifted me $5,000 in a Robinhood account to learn how to invest responsibly (w gift btw). I also plan to contribute 10% of my current savings (\\~2k) plus 10% of any future income. My current plan is to invest \\~3/5 in secure ETFs and very stable stocks like VTI, VOO, QQQM, MSFT, etc., \\~1/5 in bonds and stable commodities like gold, and use the other 1/5 to have some fun with individual stocks and a bit of day trading (not actually expecting to beat the market). I don't even want to touch shorts, options, or futures until I'm *much* more knowledgeable and financially stable. Also, I bought $100 of btc, decided it was stupid, and sold at a 30 cent loss. I've heard a lot of negatives about Robinhood, so I was wondering if I should keep the money there or transfer it to something else like Fidelity. I do like the 3.5% interest on cash, but if there's something better, I want to use that. Also, any notes on my investment strategy? Thanks! Mods, feel free to remove if you feel this breaks rule 4. Note: I already switched my account from margin to cash.",

Granted, I am newer (I’ve been dabbling here and there but decided to actually take my finances into my own hands) so I don’t know if there’s something else I may be interested in later. I have (or had) a Fidelity account a while ago just never invested anything in it. I ask this because I’ve seen many from this forum say their bond account isn’t really trust worthy. Also, unless I read wrong I believe they only have up to $50,000 in securities insured, which is something I’m not a fan of. I had planned to put $200/week into my account for investing so I’d get to that point in a few years. I want to make sure I’m covered, does anyone have experience with that? Am I safe or just transfer it over to Fidelity? Can I just move my securities over to Fidelity from Public or would I have to cash out? Thanks!",

I don’t understand why that is? Interest rates are coming down, and it seems like we’re starting to see liquidity injections. Geopolitically the world is improving and a little more stable. Meanwhile beginning of 2025, there was so much uncertainty and tariffs and yet we still saw a rally. Can someone explain to me why the market is risk off NOW with the current circumstances?",

Meanwhile beginning of 2025 there was so much uncertainty and tariffs and yet we still saw a rally . Can someone explain to me why the market is risk off NOW with the current circumstances"

I don't have much help during the day so I was thinking it would be great if I could write for a financial blog at night. 1- Do you have any ideas on good financial blogs I could write for? 2- For the above, do you know any that typically take freelance writers? I do have quite a bit of experience (almost 20 years) and what I think is a good resume. This is an idea I had that would allow me to stay on top of the markets without having to go to a traditional 9-5. I was thinking maybe an article or 2 a month (or more).

In layman's term, they will be the only refiner in north america to produce battery grade cobalt. Very important for lithium-ion batteries as this is a core material in those types of batteries. They plan to finish construction some time in 2027 hopefully and their biggest customer seems to be LG so thats a positive look. They also had a recent debt restructuring which helped reduce their debt I believe. If you have any important or relevant information please share, as I am trying to learn more about this stock. It feels like it has a good future but it just needs to be able to execute first.",

In laymans term they will be the only refiner in north america to produce battery grade cobalt . Very important for lithiumion batteries as this is a core material in those types of batteries . They plan to finish construction some time in 2027 hopefully and their biggest customer seems to be LG so thats a positive look . They also had a recent debt restructuring which helped reduce their debt I believe . If you have any important or relevant information please share as I am trying to learn more about this stock . It feels like it has a good future but it just needs to be able to execute first ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I hope this is the right place to pose this question. ​I’m 22 years old and currently have about $28,000 in a Roth IRA managed by Edward Jones. After realizing I’m paying ~1.5% in annual fees to lag the market, I’ve decided to pull the trigger and consolidate everything to Fidelity to self-manage. ​ ​The Proposed Portfolio (Fidelity Funds): ​I’m planning a 60/20/20 split: -​60% FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index): My core US foundation. -​20% FTIHX (Fidelity Total International Index): For global diversification/safety net. -​20% FSPGX (Fidelity Large Cap Growth Index): My \"tilt\" to overweight big tech/growth for the next 10-15 years. ​My Rationale: -​FSKAX gets me the whole US market. -​FTIHX at 20% feels like enough international exposure to avoid being 100% US, without dragging down returns too much if the US continues to outperform. -​FSPGX is my \"aggressive\" bet. I know it overlaps with FSKAX, but I want to double down on growth/tech while I’m 22. ​My Questions for you: -​Is the 20% tilt to FSPGX overkill given that FSKAX is already tech-heavy? -​Is 20% International (FTIHX) a good middle ground? I see some people say 0% and others say 40% (market weight). I’m trying to find the sweet spot for maximum growth. -​Are there any specific \"gotchas\" or better fund equivalents at Fidelity I should be using instead (e.g., FZROX vs FSKAX)? ​Thanks in advance for the feedback!",

Or you could just not get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds. in short, seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy, like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 1-3 blue chip stocks",

Or you could just not_get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds . in short seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 13 blue chip stocks"

      "selftext": "This probably isn't your typical penny stock. Because it's actually a deep value-play. And it probably won't be a quick mover either...unless it gets acquired (which I believe it will)....but more on that later. What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry. Vitamins/supplements/nutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future. An aging population and a friendly administration to non-pharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead. The company currently trades at a $9.6m market cap. They have $4.7m in cash and 0 debt, giving us an enterprise value of $4.9m. Fiscal 2025 revenue (ending June 30th) was $54.3m, compared to $50.3m in the year ago period. Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here, but on aggregate this is a growing business. **The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue. That's undervalued clue #1** The company has trailing 12-month EBITDA of $2m. On an **EV/EBITDA basis this is 2.4x. That's undervalued clue #2** Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt. The company's inventory is $10.5m, which is more than the current market cap of the company. **Simply put, they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for. That's undervalued clue #3** The hidden value here is really in their real estate. They only have their entire property & equipment valued at $1.8m. This is despite owning a 40,000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate. Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $8-10m range. **The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what it's actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company. That's undervalued clue #4** Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet. The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value. **Simply put, the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for, without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business. That's undervalued clue #5.** I've always tried to align myself with people smarter than me. And the fact that the stock is 40% owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign. The DeSantis family, thru CDS holdings, control just over 13m shares, or about 43% of the stock. Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP. William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP, and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius. It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values. I'm sure they're looking at the same numbers I'm looking at, and realize the company's assets are probably worth around $1/share (current share price is in the low $0.30s). And that's valuing the company's profitable operations at $0. We're just talking assets here. **Risks:** As with most penny stocks, things are never going to be perfect. You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward. The main risk here is with customer concentration. The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for, Life Extension and Herbalife. Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue, and Herbalife is around 25%. These are multi-decade relationships so I'd weight the probability of losing these customers as low, but it's still a risk. INBP has been in business for over 50 years, so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry. **Conclusion**: It's not often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value. And not just a little below, INBP is 50% below net asset value. And probably more like 70% below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate. There's a lot of margin for error here, and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires. I think it's a matter of when, and not if, the company is acquired. Disclosure: Long",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably isnt your typical penny stock . Because its actually a deep valueplay . And it probably wont be a quick mover either ... unless it gets acquired which I believe it will .... but more on that later . What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry . Vitaminssupplementsnutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future . An aging population and a friendly administration to nonpharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead . The company currently trades at a $ 9.6m market cap . They have $ 4.7m in cash and 0 debt giving us an enterprise value of $ 4.9m . Fiscal 2025 revenue ending June 30th was $ 54.3m compared to $ 50.3m in the year ago period . Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here but on aggregate this is a growing business . The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue . Thats undervalued clue 1 The company has trailing 12month EBITDA of $ 2m . On an EVEBITDA basis this is 2.4x . Thats undervalued clue 2 Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt . The companys inventory is $ 10.5m which is more than the current market cap of the company . Simply put they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for . Thats undervalued clue 3 The hidden value here is really in their real estate . They only have their entire property equipment valued at $ 1.8m . This is despite owning a 40000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate . Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $ 810m range . The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what its actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company . Thats undervalued clue 4 Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet . The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value . Simply put the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business . Thats undervalued clue 5 . Ive always tried to align myself with people smarter than me . And the fact that the stock is 40 % owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign . The DeSantis family thru CDS holdings control just over 13m shares or about 43 % of the stock . Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP . William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius . It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values . Im sure theyre looking at the same numbers Im looking at and realize the companys assets are probably worth around $ 1share current share price is in the low $ 0.30s . And thats valuing the companys profitable operations at $ 0 . Were just talking assets here . Risks As with most penny stocks things are never_going to be perfect . You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward . The main risk here is with customer concentration . The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for Life Extension and Herbalife . Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue and Herbalife is around 25 % . These are multidecade relationships so Id weight the probability of losing these customers as low but its still a risk . INBP has been in business for over 50 years so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry . Conclusion Its not_often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value . And not_just a little below INBP is 50 % below net asset value . And probably more like 70 % below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate . Theres a lot of margin for error here and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires . I think its a matter of when and not_if the company is acquired . Disclosure Long"

      "selftext": "With CES 2026 happening next week I thought it would be a good time to discuss what people’s favourite robotic stocks are. Typically during the CES event there is a lot of hype around robotics and some of the largest companies discuss and show off the latest and upcoming developments in the robotics industry. My personal favourites right now are RR (Richtech Robotics) and SERV (Serve Robotics). Richtech will be showing off their latest robots at CES next week. They have a wide range of robots that will service various sectors and have partnerships with Nvidia. Serve robotics is mainly focused on food delivery but have deals already with major food delivery companies. What are your favourites and how do you think the robotics sector will do this year? There seems to be growing hype around Robotics recently and the change it can have in various sectors.",

      "selftext": "Thoughts on agency MREITs with 12-20% yield like AGNC, NLY, DX, ORC, TWO, ARR etc., (and mortgage companies like RKT, LDI, UWMC.) My basic thesis is below but I’d like outside opinions since every friend I have from working in the mortgage industry has no opinions. Please tell me where I am wrong. Mortgages companies and Mortgage REITS (probably the best risk adjusted value niche in the market) • ⁠It affects so many people (and therefore our justifiably unpopular president’s popularity leading into midterms) and is driven by policy and regulation that the executive branch largely has control over. Trump has more • ⁠Mortgage spreads are historically wide when corporate spreads (ex ORCL) are tight • ⁠Deregulation for mortgages and banking • ⁠Lower Capital requirements means more lending • ⁠Funding/repo rates are gonna drop more with the federal • ⁠LT rates anchored with largest treasury buybacks of all time • ⁠MREITs yield 12-20% dividends so when rates fall and will look even more attractive on a relative basis. Meanwhile their higher net interest spread will make them more profitable and they should continue to appreciate. • ⁠Financial/Mortgage companies are full of paper pushers who do countless repetitive tasks whose jobs are the most easily replaced with AI. No edge AI sensors or insane computational energy needed for how straightforward these are. Headcount expense can plummet. Outside catalyst bet: - Declaring housing an emergency, Trump can order his new lackey at the fed is to start to buy mortgage bonds in some form of QE tightening spreads. Potential Risk - People may not want to move cuz of their mortgage rates and material costs can rise with the inevitable “run it hot” inflation. Also, K shaped economy and labor weakness.",

      "selftext": "If you are looking for a stock that could be a ten bagger, I would recommend you consider Symbotic (SYM). This is highly speculative, and the prices assumes substantial growth, but the sky is the limit for this one. To quote its business summary: “Symbotic Inc., an automation technology company, develops technologies to enhance operating efficiencies in modern warehouses. The company automates the processing of pallets, cases, and individual items in warehouses. Its systems enhance operations at the front end of the supply chain.” I strongly recommend you looks the video at their website to understand what they do. I love their products! But, the thing I like even more is their customer list. It may be short but it is growing and the additions are trend setters that you have to respect. The list includes: Walmart Target Albertsons They have a joint venture with SoftBank which is called GreenBox. This provides warehouse automation as a service; therefore, the customer does not have to incur upfront costs. They recently picked up Medline as a client. Medline has connections with Blackstone, Carlyle Group, and Hillman &Friedman. This has the product and connections to go through the roof! This is not a recommendation, draw your own conclusions.",

When a company does an earnings call, management usually makes a lot of statements about what they plan to do over the next quarters or year. Margin expansion, revenue growth, new products, cost cuts, timelines, etc. Do you personally track any of that over time? For example, do you ever go back and check: What they said last year Versus what actually happened later Or do you mostly just focus on the current numbers and forward guidance and move on? If you do track it, how do you do it? Thanks in advance!!",

However, from a portfolio allocation standpoint, if the smartest investors such as Berkshire Hathaway are keeping a lot of cash for a downturn, why shouldn’t retail investors hold a bigger cash position now? See below article on Berkshire I am NOT talking about silly things such as selling all stocks or YOLOing into a meme stock, but tactically increasing cash allocation for 3-6 months after S&P 500 has gone up almost 80% cumulatively in the last three years. Specially if you have new money now, would you invest all at once into S&P index at the current valuation or keep more cash position? Edit: clarified that I am not debating VOO and chill approach, which I think is the right strategy for most. My question is about investing a large cash position immediately or holding cash for 3-6 months.",

I thought Venmo would help but it just seems like this company is lost and has no real prospects to turn it around in 2026.

Plus I didnt need the losses in 2025 . I did finally give up on PayPal after about 5 years of DCAs in on the stock . I thought Venmo would help but it just seems like this company is lost and has no_real prospects to turn it around in 2026 . Also if you sold did you wait until November December or did you decide earlier in the year"

      "selftext": "Happy New Year, everyone. After the frenzy of 2025 subsided, 2026 feels entirely different now. The once dominant Mag7 companies have begun to diverge. The market no longer buys into so called AI potential; instead, it focuses on who can actually deliver cash flow from AI monetization. These are the three stocks I'm focusing on in 2026: 1. GOOG: I know many find Google boring. But with Gemini 3.0's deep integration and Google Cloud's growth outpacing peers, they've proven the skeptics wrong. Their AI Agent monetization within Workspace will be this year's big surprise. Crucially, compared to Microsoft or Nvidia, Google remains relatively “cheaply” valued. 2. VRT: If 2024-2025 was the year of chips, then 2026 is the year of power grids. Every data center built today requires top tier cooling and power management, and Vertiv is the undisputed leader in this space. As long as tech giants keep pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure, VRT will keep raking in profits. This is a classic “shovel business” no matter which AI model wins, they'll need its liquid cooling tech. 3. VRTX: Their cystic fibrosis drug faces virtually no competition, and their CRISPR gene editing pipeline is entering harvest mode. In years of heightened tech stock volatility, growth stocks like VRTX with deep moats and resilience to economic cycles can significantly stabilize portfolios. My current strategy is to steer clear of pure hardware hype and focus on companies controlling infrastructure or vertical applications with exceptionally high margins. Which investments do you see as valuable by 2026? This article is for informational purposes only. Invest with caution!",

      "selftext_processed": "Happy New Year everyone . After the frenzy of 2025 subsided 2026 feels entirely different now . The once dominant Mag7 companies have begun to diverge . The market no_longer buys into so called AI potential instead it focuses on who can actually deliver cash flow from AI monetization . These are the three stocks Im focusing on in 2026 1 . GOOG I know many find Google boring . But with Gemini 3.0s deep integration and Google Clouds growth outpacing peers theyve proven the skeptics wrong . Their AI Agent monetization within Workspace will be this years big surprise . Crucially compared to Microsoft or Nvidia Google remains relatively “ cheaply ” valued . 2 . VRT If 20242025 was the year of chips then 2026 is the year of power grids . Every data center built today requires top tier cooling and power management and Vertiv is the undisputed leader in this space . As long as tech giants keep pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure VRT will keep raking in profits . This is a classic “ shovel business ” no_matter which AI model wins theyll need its liquid cooling tech . 3 . VRTX Their cystic fibrosis drug faces virtually no_competition and their CRISPR gene editing pipeline is entering harvest mode . In years of heightened tech stock volatility growth stocks like VRTX with deep moats and resilience to economic cycles can significantly stabilize portfolios . My current strategy is to steer clear of pure hardware hype and focus on companies controlling infrastructure or vertical applications with exceptionally high margins . Which investments do you see as valuable by 2026 This article is for informational purposes only . Invest with caution"

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing, and with a background in geopolitics, I decided to go pretty hard (\\~25% of my portfolio) on MPC, the largest oil refinery in the US, about a month ago. Sorta bought the peak. The logic was as follows: MPC is the largest petroleum refiner in the US. By that point it was up \\~25% YTD. 293% 5 years. Generally speaking, oil is a finite resource, and even if the world switches to renewable energy, petroleum-related products are going to remain mandatory. (asphalt, bitumen etc). As for MPC specifically, I thought it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the geopolitical situations unfolding. First of all, many of its refineries are located on the Gulf Coast, primed to receive Venezuelan crude. In fact, they were built *specifically for it*. They are the best suited refiner for sour, heavy crude, which is the vast majority of what Venezuela has. Secondly, they're the only refiner that's expanding its factories to accommodate more volume. And lastly, they've been regularly and consistently buying back shares, suggesting high confidence in the business from the company side. Geopolitically speaking, I figured MPC should benefit from the conflict no matter how it ends. When Venezuela concedes and the US gains access to VE crude, MPC wins the most because it can import raw materials at premium prices. And it **will** end that way, based on the fact that Maduro has **already** offered the US premium access to its oil reserves, and Trump has refused. This means that the only question is **how** preferential US access will be to VE crude, not whether or not it will obtain it. The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation, right? Source: [ That being said, I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down, over speculations of oversupply. But MPC is a *buyer* of oil, not a seller. The core products of MPC, like Diesel and distillates, are seeing the exact opposite. There's a supply *squeeze* in the US, not a glut. All that being said, if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute, could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month? And whether it makes sense to attempt to DCA?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys Im relatively new to investing and with a background in geopolitics I decided to go pretty hard 25 % of my portfolio on MPC the largest oil refinery in the US about a month ago . Sorta bought the peak . The logic was as follows MPC is the largest petroleum refiner in the US . By that point it was up 25 % YTD . 293 % 5 years . Generally speaking oil is a finite resource and even if the world switches to renewable energy petroleumrelated products are going to remain mandatory . asphalt bitumen etc . As for MPC specifically I thought it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the geopolitical situations unfolding . First of all many of its refineries are located on the Gulf Coast primed to receive Venezuelan crude . In fact they were built specifically for it . They are the best suited refiner for sour heavy crude which is the vast majority of what Venezuela has . Secondly theyre the only refiner thats expanding its factories to accommodate more volume . And lastly theyve been regularly and consistently buying back shares suggesting high confidence in the business from the company side . Geopolitically speaking I figured MPC should benefit from the conflict no_matter how it ends . When Venezuela concedes and the US gains access to VE crude MPC wins the most because it can import raw materials at premium prices . And it will end that way based on the fact that Maduro has already offered the US premium access to its oil reserves and Trump has refused . This means that the only question is how preferential US access will be to VE crude not_whether or not_it will obtain it . The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation right Source That being said I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down over speculations of oversupply . But MPC is a buyer of oil not_a seller . The core products of MPC like Diesel and distillates are seeing the exact opposite . Theres a supply squeeze in the US not_a glut . All that being said if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month And whether it makes sense to attempt to DCA"

      "selftext": "I’m a Canadian DIY investor managing my own portfolio and investing an additional $1,500–$2,000 weekly, mostly into US equities. I’m not looking for a financial advisor. Instead, I’m looking for a paid online service that offers: • Clear buy/sell guidance • Model portfolios • ETF recommendations • Rules‑based or systematic frameworks I’m willing to spend up to ~$1,000/year if the service provides real value. My timeline: • Wife has a ~$70K pension starting in ~5 years • I’m targeting retirement in 6–8 years There are tons of newsletters and advisory platforms out there, but I’m trying to narrow down which ones are actually worth paying for. Which online services do you recommend for someone who wants structured guidance but still wants to stay fully DIY? Thanks in advance for your advice *** I understand that there are no service that are 100% accurate. I have many US stocks and really unsure what to keep, what to sell… I am looking at different services like SeekingAlpha, Morningstar, … but comments / reviews are all over the map. Looking for any advice from you folks that have had some success with similar service ***",

I ’ m not_looking for a financial advisor . Instead I ’ m looking for a paid online service that offers • Clear buysell guidance • Model portfolios • ETF recommendations • Rules‑based or systematic frameworks I ’ m willing to spend up to $ 1000year if the service provides real value . My timeline • Wife has a $ 70K pension starting in 5 years • I ’ m targeting retirement in 6–8 years There are tons of newsletters and advisory platforms out there but I ’ m trying to narrow down which ones are actually worth paying for . Which online services do you recommend for someone who wants structured guidance but still wants to stay fully DIY Thanks in advance for your advice I understand that there are no_service that are 100 % accurate . I have many US stocks and really unsure what to keep what to sell… I am looking at different services like SeekingAlpha Morningstar … but comments reviews are all over the map . Looking for any advice from you folks that have had some success with similar service"

      "selftext": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams. - do not assume that an offer to \"help\" is legitimate. There are many dozens of types of scams - a list of scam types can be found in r/scams in the master list here: [/r/Scams Common Scam Master]( 1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot]( 2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion. 6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary. Depending on where you live - you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [ You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [ United Kingdom - Financial Conduct Authority - [ \\- a warning list of fake companies can be found here - [ Canada - CIRO - [ For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pump-and-dumps - one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with - you can find the AMA here - [ If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following: 1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to \"recover\" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers. 4. If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer - report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company.",

      "selftext_processed": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading please be aware that social media platform like Reddit Discord etc . can be a vector for scams and fraud . Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious . Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams . do not_assume that an offer to help is legitimate . There are many dozens of types of scams a list of scam types can be found in rscams in the master list here rScams Common Scam Master 1 . Good explanation of pigbuthering here Pig butchering how to spot 2 . Legitimate investment advisors do not_use WhatApp Telegram Discord etc . to provide tips . In the US it is against regulation specifically SEC Rule 17a4 and FINRA Rule 3110 . For example brokers in the US that use social media for support do not_offer investment advice . 3 . It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams . It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else . 4 . Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype . You can sometimes identify if its a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history . Often you will see that the account has posted nothing_related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks . 5 . One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never_engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd . Those are all signs of stock promotion . 6 . Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake . If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser be wary . Depending on where you live you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser . Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered . United States check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority a warning list of fake companies can be found here Canada CIRO For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pumpanddumps one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with you can find the AMA here If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam . Be aware of the following 1 . Do not_send more money . Do not_provide additional banking or credit card information . 2 . It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to recover funds for payment . This is a common followup scam . Law enforcement will never_ask for money . 3 . If a login account was created . The password used is compromised . Change all passwords that are used . The password will be shared and sold to other scammers . 4 . If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company ."

      "selftext": "Hi All, If you ever talked to a Fidelity advisor, one of their products like the FidFolio was probably shoved in your face. They claim it will save you money due to tax loss harvesting, so I put it to the test so you don't have to. Here is my honest review of how it did: Fidelity Managed FidFolios®: U.S. Total Market Index Initial Investment - $50,574.14 made on 11/27/2024. No additonal investment was mode. Current Valve (as of 1/1/26) - $56,718.84 Total tax loss harvesting - $6,933.11 If I had just invested directly into VTI with the same initial investment and reinvested all the dividends, I would actually have $57,740.65 sitting in my account. That is a difference of $1,021.81. However, with tax loss harvesting and considering my tax bracket to be 24% I should have actually saved $1,663.95 in federal taxes alone. So in theory I'm actually ahead by $642.14, which isn't a lot, but the system is working. The higher your tax rate the more this product would benefit you. Two negatives though: 1. I did find kind of annoying is that Fidelity reports my tax savings to be $2,482.05 with a giant asterick. That asterick is the assumption is that I'm in the 35% tax bracket! I find this to be extremly dishonest from Fidelity since they know exactly what my income is. 2. The money is not as liquid as I thought it would be. Actually from what I understand I would have to call Fidelity first to sell the securities within the account into cash before I can transfter it out. I don't mind the few days delay in this type of process, but I would rather do this from the app or website without having to talk to someone on the phone to get access to my money. 3. Fidelity is pushing the FidFolios product VERY HARD. This generally makes me skeptical and raises my guard. Are they making a commission on this? If the product performs better than other investment vehicles, it will sell itself like hot cakes! At the moment this product does seem to perform better than just investing directly into VTI. However, very marginally! Actually, $642.14 is just 1.1% of the overall value. If you consider state income tax burdens and/or have a higher tax rate your results may be more positive. So what do you think - VTI and chill or keep monitoring the FidFolios product?",

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |CRSP US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |CRSP US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |CRSP US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |CRSP US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets Index|\\+33.57%| |MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index|\\+32.39%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years.

However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "Football is the most-watched event in the United States. Over the next month, the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape. Last year, seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games. The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each. Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest. Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada. Up until 2018, Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘enjoy’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game. On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). By doing so, it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Today, thirty-eight states permit sports wagering in their areas. Now, another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray. They are called prediction markets. Over the last year, the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports, politics, business, weather, travel, and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption. The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events, and specifically football. Why does this matter for the investment world? Increasingly, the public uses its money to try to make a profit. Traditionally, the investment world was the domain where that took place. Over the last twenty years, as markets have become digitized, custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices, especially smartphones. Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity. If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options, levered ETFs, levered ETFs on single stocks, and ETFs related to any geography or activity, one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are, at the very least, blurring. The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi. Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products. In October of 2025, Polymarket received a $2 billion investment at a $9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide access to prediction products for institutions. Kalshi, the leader in global prediction markets with a 60% share and annual trading volume of over $50 billion, obtained $300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia, Andreesen-Horwitz, A16z, and Paradigm. Interestingly, one of the best-performing stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood, the online broker. When any entity suddenly finds a one-hundred-million-dollar run-rate business in less than a year, especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues, investors react favorably. As the prediction entities have gained adoption, the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically. More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas, the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6% in 2025 (perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026?) []( [Share](%%share_url%%) Whenever there is a competitive alternative, incumbents will respond to protect their market share. FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association. The following week, both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms (in partnership with the CME Group, the publicly traded futures exchange). Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry. From a regulatory standpoint, the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, it views the product as a financial derivative and not gambling. Anti-fraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘clarify’ the legal boundaries. In Congress, our on-the-ball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members (The ex-madame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember). So how should investors view this whole situation? The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting. However, betting and gambling are different. In gaming, there is a definite outcome, and the only thing one owns is the chance that one’s prediction, wager, hand, throw of the dice, or pull of the machine turns out correctly. When one invests, you own an entity that has assets and liabilities. In most cases, those assets and liabilities form operating businesses. The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity. From my perspective, and I have written this on numerous occasions, my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino. The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges, suppliers of gaming, and some underlying offshoot of both. Yes, Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged. It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and I certainly will be paying attention.",

      "selftext_processed": "Football is the mostwatched event in the United States . Over the next month the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape . Last year seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games . The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each . Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest . Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada . Up until 2018 Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘ enjoy ’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game . On May 14 2018 the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act PASPA . By doing so it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting . Today thirtyeight states permit sports wagering in their areas . Now another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray . They are called prediction markets . Over the last year the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports politics business weather travel and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption . The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events and specifically football . Why does this matter for the investment world Increasingly the public uses its money to try to make a profit . Traditionally the investment world was the domain where that took place . Over the last twenty years as markets have become digitized custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices especially smartphones . Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity . If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options levered ETFs levered ETFs on single stocks and ETFs related to any geography or activity one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are at the very least blurring . The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi . Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products . In October of 2025 Polymarket received a $ 2 billion investment at a $ 9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange ICE to provide access to prediction products for institutions . Kalshi the leader in global prediction markets with a 60 % share and annual trading volume of over $ 50 billion obtained $ 300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia AndreesenHorwitz A16z and Paradigm . Interestingly one of the bestperforming stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood the online broker . When any entity suddenly finds a onehundredmilliondollar runrate business in less than a year especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues investors react favorably . As the prediction entities have gained adoption the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically . More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6 % in 2025 perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026 Share % % share_url % % Whenever there is a competitive alternative incumbents will respond to protect their market share . FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association . The following week both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms in partnership with the CME Group the publicly traded futures exchange . Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry . From a regulatory standpoint the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC . Currently it views the product as a financial derivative and not_gambling . Antifraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘ clarify ’ the legal boundaries . In Congress our ontheball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members The exmadame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember . So how should investors view this whole situation The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting . However betting and gambling are different . In gaming there is a definite outcome and the only thing one owns is the chance that one ’ s prediction wager hand throw of the dice or pull of the machine turns out correctly . When one invests you own an entity that has assets and liabilities . In most cases those assets and liabilities form operating businesses . The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity . From my perspective and I have written this on numerous occasions my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino . The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges suppliers of gaming and some underlying offshoot of both . Yes Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged . It will be interesting to see how this evolves and I certainly will be paying attention ."

I’ve been reading about a mix of: • long-term compounding assets (equities, funds, etc.) • real estate (residential, multi-unit, or commercial) as a long-game strategy • higher-risk asymmetric assets (e.g., Bitcoin or similar alternatives) as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10+ year horizon, while still allowing for some shorter- to medium-term opportunities. Relevant parameters for context: • Age: early 30s • Location: Southern California, USA (open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida) • Employment: self-employed • Monthly income: \\~$17,000–$20,000 • Debt: none • Liquidity: high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance: moderate-to-high (comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term upside) • Time horizon: primarily 10+ years, with openness to some shorter-term plays alongside long-term compounding",

      "selftext": "I just opened my first brokerage account and I'm honestly kinda overwhelmed by all the options out there. For the last couple of years I've been reading (and watching videos) a lot about different investment approaches including stocks, options, futures, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, day trading, buy and hold, swing trading, quantitative, etc. Honestly, it's a lot to take in! I know that am not interested in set it and forget it type approaches. I believe that while historically they have done fine, there's no guarantee that the next bear market won't be -60% and won't last for decades. I really can't gamble with my retirement for a measly 7%-10% a year! Day trading seems too stressful and I have a full-time job so kinda won't work. I tend to like swing trading (from what I have read and watched) and data driven quantitative approaches. For the latter I have seen some hedge funds making a killing, but yet to find any success stories with swing trading. Quant approach seems to require a lot of learning and being good with math and stats (I'm not). Has anyone else been in the same boat as me? What did you do?",

Honestly its a lot to take in I know that am not_interested in set it and forget it type approaches . I believe that while historically they have done fine theres no_guarantee that the next bear market wont be 60 % and wont last for decades . I really cant gamble with my retirement for a measly 7 % 10 % a year Day trading seems too stressful and I have a fulltime job so kinda wont work . I tend to like swing trading from what I have read and watched and data driven quantitative approaches . For the latter I have seen some hedge funds making a killing but yet to find any success stories with swing trading . Quant approach seems to require a lot of learning and being good with math and stats Im not_Has anyone else been in the same boat as me What did you do"

      "selftext": "JPMorgan expects the labor market to slow in early 2026, followed by gradual improvement in the latter half of the year. The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies, which have reduced labor supply. Monthly job growth may decline from 50,000 to 15,000 as businesses remain cautious. Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually. I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year, particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology. As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor, automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform. While near-term gains may prove elusive, a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate. What are your thoughts on this?",

I have 1k in Sofi 1k in Nvidia and 2k in RKLB . I will be living at home for the foreseeable future and will have very limited expenses . Should I continue to invest in my brokerage or should I open up a HYSA and just dump my money in there If I were to stick with the brokerage would it be a good idea to keep investing in these types of stocks or should I go low risk and put it in VTI andor VOO"

While my targetdate fund will continuously rebalance as I approach retirement what is the best strategy to reduce risk in my eventually heavyweighted VOO portfolio in 20 years when I am closer to retirement From what I understand I would either have to realize gains to move funds to a more conservative option while potentially still being in a high income tax bracket or simply stop contributing to VOO and invest in more conservative funds to slowly rebalance . Am I missing another strategy"

Will be nimble (e.g. take profits, reallocate to better performing opportunities, cut losses, etc.) First pick - PAA - inspired by the drill baby drill post from a couple years ago! - PAA continues to execute: year over year EBITDA growth, deleveraging, making add-on acquisitions, and divesting non-core businesses - Low IV: makes sense given it’s a dividend stock, but IV is historically low. Can pick up Jan 2027 $20C for $0.40. A 5% rise in underlying stock price should make these double. a 10% rise would triple and a 14% rise would make these quadruple. - Attractive valuation: trading at sub 7x EV / EBITDA which is less than peers (ET trades for 8.5x) Will keep you updated on all future trades.

      "selftext": "Disclaimer: This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate. Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes. TL;DR: CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today. At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem. That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it. On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist. This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart. Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it. This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories. It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure. Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways. U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle. Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. That disconnect is the thesis.

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate . Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes . TLDR CPNG only trades in the U.S. but the crisis is entirely in Korea lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension the public is actively boycotting and this is a newly profitable logisticsheavy business that can not survive disruption . U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis not_a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today . At the National Assembly hearing lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it ’ s framed in U.S. outlets . Domestically investigators are disputing Coupang ’ s disclosures challenging sworn testimony and raising perjury accusations . Internationally it ’ s still framed as a data breach plus compensation . Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem . That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S . The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE . There is no_Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage no_local shareholder pressure and no_market release valve . All price discovery happens in the U.S. while all political regulatory and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea . Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it . On the ground public reaction is not_abstract . Lawmakers civic groups and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension not_just fines or apologies . Korean media coverage has shifted from “ breach response ” to “ whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form. ” At the consumer level largescale boycott behavior “ 탈팡 ” is observable with appusage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share . In Korea boycotts are not_symbolic — people actually leave platforms especially when alternatives exist . This is existential for Coupang because of its structure . The company only recently became profitable after years of losses . It is a logisticsheavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume dense routing and habitdriven repeat usage . A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability . Drivers leave . Sellers leave . Customers retrain behavior . This is not_a business you can pause and restart . Two weeks ago Coupang installed a U.S.trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis . Domestically that has been widely interpreted as insulating decisionmakers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability . That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it . This is why this trade is no_longer about valuation multiples or growth trajectories . It ’ s about whether a newly profitable logisticsdependent company — openly boycotted politically isolated under criminal scrutiny and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure . Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways . U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle . Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . That disconnect is the thesis .

      "selftext": "25 year old male. Took 500 to 90k within a month and ended up losing every penny of it (EDIT: THE LOSS PORN IS NOT ABOUT THE $500, but the 90k I peaked at) and now have pretty much nothing to my name. I still have my tech job, but there’s a pretty high chance I’m gonna get laid off soon even if it hasn’t happened yet. Completely lonely in my personal life with no real friends and a non existent dating life. My entire world is crumbling before me and losing all this money is just the final gut punch. If I could give any advice to anyone out there, just don’t trade options. They will ruin your life. Look, I’m not completely giving up yet even though I’m undoubtedly at a very difficult point, but I hope I’ve been able to prevent someone else from having their life ruined by options. Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy’s soon. EDIT: I know that I technically only lost $500, but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k, actually money that I could’ve withdrawn, before falling back to $0. There is no way to mentally see this as just a $500 loss. Trust me I would not be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $500 to $0. By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $0. EDIT: Yes, I regret that I didn’t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $0, but i guess hindsight is 20/20 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past.",

Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy ’ s soon . EDIT I know that I technically only lost $ 500 but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k actually money that I could ’ ve withdrawn before falling back to $ 0 . There is no_way to mentally see this as just a $ 500 loss . Trust me I would not_be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $ 500 to $ 0 . By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $ 0 . EDIT Yes I regret that I didn ’ t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $ 0 but i guess hindsight is 2020 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past ."

Broadcom also appears to have secured meaningful orders from AWS and Microsoft, with strong revenue growth expected by 2027. Citi forecasts that XPUs will grow faster than GPUs by 2027, driven by a smaller base and the acceleration of custom AI chip programs. Some people with a zero-sum mindset might argue this is negative for NVDA or even AMD. But those closer to the industry know that NVIDIA will continue selling every chip, system, and rack it can produce. AVGO and MRVL have also been performing very well, not only in custom ASICs but also across networking and storage. Curious how everyone is positioning in AVGO right now.",

      "selftext": "Obviously a lot of traction of the outperformance of the [2025 WSB picks]( I wanted to do a slightly more thorough analysis to see if there was any real alpha here. **TLDR:** *evidence of excess returns, but the performance is best explained by a highly aggressive, factor-loaded portfolio in a strong market environment* To evaluate alpha, I used standard asset-pricing models, including CAPM and the Fama-French four-factor model (market, size, value, and momentum). These models help distinguish returns driven by skill from returns driven by exposure to known risk factors such as growth, momentum, or small-cap bias. The portfolio was an equal weighted basket of the 10 picks: * AMD * GOOG * HOOD * META * MSTR * PLTR * RDDT * RKLB * TSLA * WMT *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* (*Note: this analysis is through Nov 28, since Fama-French hasnt published daily returns for December*) **Descriptive Stats:** * **Portfolio Return**: 61.2% * **SPY Return**: 17.9% * **Portfolio Outperformance**: 43.3% * **Portfolio Vol**: 44.5% * **SPY Vol**: 20.2% * **Portfolio Sharpe | Sortino**: 1.85 | 2.82 * **SPY Sharpe | Sortino**: 0.86 | 1.29 ***Interpretation:*** *significant outperformance, with significantly more volatility* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **CAPM Regression** * **Adj. R-Squared**: 0.718 * **Market beta**: 1.88 ***Interpretation:*** *The portfolio had an extremely high beta. I.e. if the market goes up, all else equal you expect the portfolio to go up 1.88x the market. If it goes down, same thing in reverse* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Fama-French Four Factor Regression** * **Mkt-Rf**: 1.59 *(very high market risk)* * **SMB**: 0.64 (small cap weighted) * **HML**: -0.73 *(strong growth bias)* * **MOM**: 0.51 *(significant momentum exposure)* ***Interpretation:*** *Confirms that the portfolio was significantly weighted towards \"levered\" growth names* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Conclusions:** nothing novel here, WSB tilts towards higher risk, momentum names. If the same exercise is done in 2026, you should expect outperformance if the market goes up and underperformance if the market goes down. *Sources/Methods: Fama-French Library, yFinance, Python* *Happy to answer any questions or provide code if people are interested in running it themselves*",

      "selftext": "I want to share some analysis I’ve been thinking about. I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts. This is for discussion and research purposes only. # 1. Burry’s Thesis Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io]( This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com]( He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com]( and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit). The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position. # 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org]( The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org]( Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD. # 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth]( giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200]( (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price. [Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024]( with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments. The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly. # 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs: |Phase|CPU Generation|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers| |2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention| |3|Milan|Default choice for workloads| |4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share| This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs. # 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation. * NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales * Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace * Refresh cycles could stretch * Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash. # 6. Signals to Watch * MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 * Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale * ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration * NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates. # 7. Bottom Line * NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next. * Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact. * The AI shift is gradual and structural. * If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape. This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*",

      "selftext_processed": "I want to share some analysis I ’ ve been thinking about . I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts . This is for discussion and research purposes only . 1 . Burry ’ s Thesis Michael Burry ’ s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated . Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years en.bloomingbit.io This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality . Burry estimates this mismatch could total $ 176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 investing.com He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dotcom era sahmcapital.com and is using longdated puts expiring in 2027 reddit . The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real . But Burry may underestimate AMD ’ s strategic position . 2 . How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA ’ s AI dominance was not_planned from day one . CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for generalpurpose computing not_AI . Ian Buck a Stanford CS PhD experimented with GPUs for nongraphics workloads . His project Brook became the foundation for CUDA en.wikipedia.org The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers . Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude en.wikipedia.org Key takeaway NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company . That “ stumble ” created their early dominance but nothing_guarantees the next discovery will not_favor AMD . 3 . AMD ’ s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with 192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TBs bandwidth giving it a 36 % memory advantage over NVIDIAs H200 141GB HBM3e 4.8 TBs . Cost is approximately $ 1014k per MI300X versus $ 4044k for H200 roughly one quarter of NVIDIAs price . Microsoft Meta Oracle and TensorWave deployed 327000 MI300X units in 2024 with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services . This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale not_experimental deployments . The main constraint is ROCm software maturity . Historical precedent suggests this is temporary CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance . If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings AMDs hardware advantage could scale rapidly . 4 . EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical generationovergeneration growth in server CPUs PhaseCPU GenerationResult 1NaplesReentry into data centers 2RomeCompetitive performance and cost gains attention 3MilanDefault choice for workloads 4GenoaTurinDominant market share This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally . The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs . 5 . The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not_bursting . That implies sudden collapse . What I see is a gradual rotation . NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace Refresh cycles could stretch Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no_expectation of panic selling . Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold . Burry ’ s longdated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash . 6 . Signals to Watch MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates . 7 . Bottom Line NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company . AMD could be next . Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch but he underestimates AMDs potential impact . The AI shift is gradual and structural . If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape . This analysis is based on research and historical patterns . History is repeating itself and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA just like they did with Intel ."

Bought her this 18k Tiffany heart necklace for her birthday seemed like the right move at the time. She breaks up with me just a couple weeks before the day. I kept it because returning it felt like admitting defeat (and honestly, I forgot about the return window). Then gold just takes off goes straight up like NVDA on a hot streak. The necklace is suddenly worth 50% more. She’s long gone, no texts or anything. Gold doesn’t disappear on you. Somehow accidentally hedged against the heartbreak. Lesson learned: relationships come and go, but commodities? They’re forever!!!",

      "selftext": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\". So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis: The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. The entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. There's two bottlenecks: InP Substrates - \\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc) \\- Optical transceivers (5g, data) \\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military) \\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters) \\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia’s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.) This is a DUOPOLY from \\-AXTI (est. \\~30–35%) \\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%) \\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%) Indium Phosphide (the source material for everything): Vital Materials - 35% AXT - 25% Before, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom. Now they're used for the entire AI buildout. Just to give u an example $AXTI -> $LITE -> $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down. Google would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -> hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls. THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand > supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI. This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. NFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout. I just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout. It's a monopoly in mining -> refining -> substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary. TLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.",

      "selftext_processed": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams . And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for low quality . So heres the more TLDR version of my thesis The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects . The entire AI Growth story ends in 2026 if theres no_InP substrates materials . BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL One Company $ AXTI . Theres two bottlenecks InP Substrates Hyperscaler optics TPU pods etc Optical transceivers 5g data LiDAR robotaxis drones military Optical Modules interconnect clusters Silicon photonics laser dies Nvidia ’ s future copackaged optics and IntelBroadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays . This is a DUOPOLY from AXTI est . 30–35 % Sumitomo est.30 % JX Nippon est . 1015 % Indium Phosphide the source material for everything Vital Materials 35 % AXT 25 % Before this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom . Now theyre used for the entire AI buildout . Just to give u an example $ AXTI $ LITE $ GOOGL TPU . without any of these members the program shuts down . Google would literally pay $ 5B 50 TIMES prices $ 140m TAM from 2024 DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesnt stall because Meta decided to buy them out . And this would only be a like a 34 % added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap . If Meta does it first then Googles TPU program stalls . If Google does it first Microsofts ASIC problem stalls . THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW demand supply by multiple factors preramp AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains . Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI . This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis materials research . Nobodys_posted about this stock here in the past 5 years youre welcome . Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday because theres a low chance this goes from $ 15 to $ 150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026 . I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof . NFI theres a chance China sends this to $ 0 with export controls so dont follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts . But if this goes to $ 0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout . I just thought this could also easily be a $ 7B company given they control 13rd of the worlds entire substrate capacity and then 14th of the worlds entire materials used for AI buildout . Its a monopoly in mining refining substrate production . And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide . I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary . TLDR THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY . FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $ 700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP ."
