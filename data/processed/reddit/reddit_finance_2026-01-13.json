      "selftext": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy, but hear me out. Over the past year or so, companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP-1 is the \"#1 savor\" for weight lost. Now, I'm not against the drug and I believe that it is very useful. The process of losing weight is different for everyone, and this drug is great in that sense. However......like with all good things, people find a way to abuse them! There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions. Even on social media (TikTok and others), there are doctors, practicing and non practicing, that are actively/heavily *promoting* some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability. Idc about the logistics of it all, I'm just telling you what I see on my social media feeds. In some weird way, I'm getting opioid crisis/Purdue Pharma/Sackler Family vibes. **No**, there are **no direct parallels** necessarily, but things just seem off about this. I think it's probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse. Also, as we all know with medicine, it usually takes years to hear about major side effects, which is normal. On top of that, I'm sure there are people using it in *creative* ways. Basically, I'm betting for even more significant side effects, lack of adherence and misuse/abuse. This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the stores/pharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make....you know what. But before that, I'm sure sudafed was a free-for-all type of situation. Now on to the investing part...I'm not too sure how to do this. Doing some quick research, and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago. I think it's called shorted/shorting? The only difference is that I don't have billions, so I won't lose billions..haha. I'm thinking of it as something on the side, small amounts of money over a period of time. But I think the same principle still applies, right? Obviously, this isn't a short term thing. But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually, and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way. What are your opinions? How should I start? Overall, do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this? Idk...humans always find a way to abuse things, so i don't feel too crazy for this idea.",

      "selftext_processed": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy but hear me out . Over the past year or so companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP1 is the 1 savor for weight lost . Now Im not_against the drug and I believe that it is very useful . The process of losing weight is different for everyone and this drug is great in that sense . However ...... like with all good things people find a way to abuse them There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions . Even on social media TikTok and others there are doctors practicing and non practicing that are activelyheavily promoting some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability . Idc about the logistics of it all Im just telling you what I see on my social media feeds . In some weird way Im getting opioid crisisPurdue PharmaSackler Family vibes . No there are no direct parallels necessarily but things just seem off about this . I think its probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse . Also as we all know with medicine it usually takes years to hear about major side effects which is normal . On top of that Im sure there are people using it in creative ways . Basically Im betting for even more significant side effects lack of adherence and misuseabuse . This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the storespharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make .... you know what . But before that Im sure sudafed was a freeforall type of situation . Now on to the investing part ... Im not_too sure how to do this . Doing some quick research and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago . I think its called shortedshorting The only difference is that I dont have billions so I wont lose billions .. haha . Im thinking of it as something on the side small amounts of money over a period of time . But I think the same principle still applies right Obviously this isnt a short term thing . But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way . What are your opinions How should I start Overall do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this Idk ... humans always find a way to abuse things so i dont feel too crazy for this idea ."

      "selftext": "Is anyone else watching BitGo? With Circle (+168%) and Bullish (+143%) recently mooning, I decided to do some digging on this one. The Good (Why it might pump): \\- Insane Growth: H1 2025 Revenue hit $4.19B (nearly 4x YoY). \\- Real Assets: They hold $90B+ in custody (mostly BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, SUI). \\- Big Backers: Goldman and Citi are leading the deal. The Bad (Why I’m worried): Margins are Dead: Despite 4x revenue, net income dropped to $12.6M. Operating costs are eating them alive. Valuation: Expected 4B-5B. Priced for perfection. My IPO strategy: The quick flip. I’m treating this as a short-term flip, not a long-term hold. I’m treating this purely as a short-term arbitrage, not a long-term hold. \\- Enter: At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave. \\- Exit: If it hits +50% on Day 1, I’m selling. \\- Stop Loss: If it breaks issue price, cut it loose. Verdict: Great narrative (First Custody Stock), but the financials are shaky. I plan to profit from the initial volatility, but I won't be holding this long-term. Thoughts?",

Big Backers Goldman and Citi are leading the deal . The Bad Why I ’ m worried Margins are Dead Despite 4x revenue net income dropped to $ 12.6M . Operating costs are eating them alive . Valuation Expected 4B5B . Priced for perfection . My IPO strategy The quick flip . I ’ m treating this as a shortterm flip not_a longterm hold . I ’ m treating this purely as a shortterm arbitrage not_a longterm hold . Enter At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave . Exit If it hits 50 % on Day 1 I ’ m selling . Stop Loss If it breaks issue price cut it loose . Verdict Great narrative First Custody Stock but the financials are shaky . I plan to profit from the initial volatility but I wont be holding this longterm . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Everyone is worried that the Powell investigation will pose an unprecedented challenge to the Fed's independence, and that a credibility crisis could trigger a systemic downgrade in the United States assets , I wanna say, trading stocks from a macro perspective is no different from throwing darts to pick stocks. This shit didn’t prevent $GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today. Clearly, we cannot expect a $4-trillion company to grow by another Doble. However, the deepening of NVIDIA's cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size. Which ONE ? $LLY is indeed the \"king of industrialization\" of AI pharmaceuticals, and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $1 billion, but there will be no surprises if it is already Prcie in, and I won't go to places with a lot of people. $ILMN is indeed a good alternative, it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution, and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider, and its business model is transforming to high-profit software and services, but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in. So, who will be the next target for capital inflow? I belive $RXRX is the best choice. It is not crowded at present, has stopped falling in the low demand zone, and its share price is also reasonable. Once the rotation reaches $RXRX, there is still a chance to double at least. Recursion is Nvidia's \"core ally\" and a direct equity investment in AI-driven pharmaceutical research. Its Recursion OS is a closed-loop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data, which represents its core competitive advantage. Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabyte-scale internal dataset capable of executing AI-driven, closed-loop experiments. Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson, $RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on \"translating biology into search problems,\" aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia. Most importantly, $RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027, and it operates BioHive-2, the industry's most advanced AI supercomputer. I am absolutely committed to supporting $RXRX.",

This shit didn ’ t prevent $ GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today . Clearly we can not expect a $ 4trillion company to grow by another Doble . However the deepening of NVIDIAs cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size . Which ONE $ LLY is indeed the king of industrialization of AI pharmaceuticals and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $ 1 billion but there will be no_surprises if it is already Prcie in and I wont go to places with a lot of people . $ ILMN is indeed a good alternative it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider and its business model is transforming to highprofit software and services but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in . So who will be the next target for capital inflow I belive $ RXRX is the best choice . It is not_crowded at present has stopped falling in the low demand zone and its share price is also reasonable . Once the rotation reaches $ RXRX there is still a chance to double at least . Recursion is Nvidias core ally and a direct equity investment in AIdriven pharmaceutical research . Its Recursion OS is a closedloop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data which represents its core competitive advantage . Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabytescale internal dataset capable of executing AIdriven closedloop experiments . Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson $ RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on translating biology into search problems aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia . Most importantly $ RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027 and it operates BioHive2 the industrys most advanced AI supercomputer . I am absolutely committed to supporting $ RXRX ."

      "title": "What I learned from Tracking My Investment Calls in 2025",
      "selftext": "As a long time investor, I realized this year that I often had tens if not hundreds of strong calls or at least \"hunches\" throughout a year. I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to \"rationalize\" away. So this year, I decided to record and publish every \"buy\" in my mind throughout the year, along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision (and timestamp the day of the call). In order to systematize the process, I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly. Winners would be categorized as up more than 5% throughout the period. Neutral picks are within 5% up or down (dead money, or recent calls mainly). Losers were tagged as greater than a 5% loss. All picks (regardless of June or December timestamp) would be equally weighted. An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances. **The Results:** I ended up writing 35 \"calls\" between April and December 2025. Price on the day I published vs today. No edits. No pretending I sold the top. No “would’ve sized this differently.” Just the equal weight returns. Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly **42%**. **Winners/Neutral/Losers** * **Up more than 5%:** **18 / 35 (51%)** * **Neutral (±5%):** **5 / 35 (14%)** * **Down more than 5%:** **12 / 35 (34%)** Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy: Diversification among convicted buys is not optional for stock pickers. Yes, a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out, but some flat out did not and were anchors to the portfolio. Even if you are \"right\" over the long term, you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost, timing matters. Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance. One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come. (even at a 1/35th allocation) **A handful of names did almost all the work.** JMIA (+478%) RKLB (+288%) HOOD (+167%) AMD (+143%) SOFI (+142%). **A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns:** HNST (-52%) BMNR (-49%) COIN (-21%) HIMS (-21%) MELI (-17%) PYPL (-16%) **Another important point of discovery:** Going against the common sentiment in a stock, is right a heck of a lot more than it's wrong. My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year (AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand), Estee Lauder Stock trading as if it's going to file bankruptcy, the death of Google by chatgpt, so on and so forth. **Lastly,** although not being able \"to sell\" certainly cost me real performance over this experiment, it also helped immensely with discipline. Not panic selling long-term convictions over a headline and inversely not selling the first 15% pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times. **Yes,** there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry, but it's often much later than you think. Overall, it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026. Regardless of the returns or bull market luck, I became an immensely better investor throughout the process. Let me know if you have any questions about the process, results, or in general.",

      "selftext_processed": "As a long time investor I realized this year that I often had tens if not_hundreds of strong calls or at least hunches throughout a year . I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to rationalize away . So this year I decided to record and publish every buy in my mind throughout the year along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision and timestamp the day of the call . In order to systematize the process I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly . Winners would be categorized as up more than 5 % throughout the period . Neutral picks are within 5 % up or down dead money or recent calls mainly . Losers were tagged as greater than a 5 % loss . All picks regardless of June or December timestamp would be equally weighted . An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances . The Results I ended up writing 35 calls between April and December 2025 . Price on the day I published vs today . No_edits . No_pretending I sold the top . No_ “ would ’ ve sized this differently. ” Just the equal weight returns . Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly 42 % . WinnersNeutralLosers Up more than 5 % 18 35 51 % Neutral ±5 % 5 35 14 % Down more than 5 % 12 35 34 % Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy Diversification among convicted buys is not_optional for stock pickers . Yes a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out but some flat out did not_and were anchors to the portfolio . Even if you are right over the long term you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost timing matters . Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance . One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come . even at a 135th allocation A handful of names did almost all the work . JMIA 478 % RKLB 288 % HOOD 167 % AMD 143 % SOFI 142 % . A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns HNST 52 % BMNR 49 % COIN 21 % HIMS 21 % MELI 17 % PYPL 16 % Another important point of discovery Going against the common sentiment in a stock is right a heck of a lot more than its wrong . My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand Estee Lauder Stock trading as if its going to file bankruptcy the death of Google by chatgpt so on and so forth . Lastly although not_being able to sell certainly cost me real performance over this experiment it also helped immensely with discipline . Not_panic selling longterm convictions over a headline and inversely not_selling the first 15 % pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times . Yes there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry but its often much later than you think . Overall it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026 . Regardless of the returns or bull market luck I became an immensely better investor throughout the process . Let me know if you have any questions about the process results or in general ."

      "selftext": "I moved my 50kish (between Roth and Rollover IRA) from my old employers retirement plan over to Schwab savings account \\[\\[\\[EDIT - I've since moved them over to Fidelity but transfer not completed yet\\]\\]. I chose not to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later, which is now. I've gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I can't help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations. I don't trust them. I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity that's still with them. It's 51% domestic stock, 38% foreign stock, 10% bonds (roughly). From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96% with Index of 22.98%. So it's actually 18k+ right now, not 15 as I thought it was last time I checked. I also have a bunch of Ethereum (I already withdrew my initial investment) and it's valued anywhere between 150,000-200,000 based on the numbers of the past month. I'm not banking on it, it's just an extra atm. What should I do with this? I have no kids, single at 37, very little debt (just vehicle) but I'm unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k\\~ salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment. I have about 30k+ in savings. I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner. Any and every advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Edit: I do not own my home, I'm back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation. I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact. I'm not counting on any inheritance. Though if I'm able to square my parents a way where they're safe and secure through the rest of their lives, they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there. Additional Edit: I've now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess 'lets goooo'. I dunno. Just tryin to survive here while having a good time",

I chose not_to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later which is now . Ive gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I cant help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations . I dont trust them . I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity thats still with them . Its 51 % domestic stock 38 % foreign stock 10 % bonds roughly . From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96 % with Index of 22.98 % . So its actually 18k right now not_15 as I thought it was last time I checked . I also have a bunch of Ethereum I already withdrew my initial investment and its valued anywhere between 150000200000 based on the numbers of the past month . Im not_banking on it its just an extra atm . What should I do with this I have no_kids single at 37 very little debt just vehicle but Im unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment . I have about 30k in savings . I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner . Any and every advice would be appreciated . Thank you . Edit I do not_own my home Im back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation . I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact . Im not_counting on any inheritance . Though if Im able to square my parents a way where theyre safe and secure through the rest of their lives they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there . Additional Edit Ive now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess lets goooo . I dunno . Just tryin to survive here while having a good time"

      "selftext": "As I've posted before here, I'm neck deep into RKT shares, from my one and ONLY YOLO from 5+ yrs ago, starting with WAMPQ ->WMIH -> COOP -> RKT last year. I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once). I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once. On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a \"Millionaire Tax\" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in \"investment\" income? I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \\*when\\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade. For example, today's losses came from getting \"caught\" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened..... Half of today's \"Loss\" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year. Any questions, happy to discuss.",

I also started getting into Options both buying AND selling them last year after learning from you all and other Reddit forums to generate income against those shares because I dont want tocant practically sell them all at once . I was and in some way still am a novice when it comes to Options and needed to learn about DTEs DeltaTheta etc by trial and ERROR . I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $ $ $ all at once . On Taxes Did you know that theres something called a Millionaire Tax surcharge in MA And that theres a 4 % NIIT Net Investment Income Tax at the Federal Level at $ 200k single $ 300k or more in investment income I also had to LEARN the HARD way when to sell Covered Calls PUTS when NOT_to when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS when you need to just BTC Buy To Close a losing Options Trade . For example todays losses came from getting caught in an overnight 10 % runup in RKT last week after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet and then dropped the $ 200B MBS bombshell afterhours . I knew RKT would get to this range but I assumed it would get to todays level after FebEarnings . Then the tweets happened ..... Half of todays Loss is from Rolling a couple of CCs upout so the loss wasnt that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend like 23x WORSE before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning . Most of RKTs potential is already priced in given the runup for now but I do expect it to be into the high $ 20s next year which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $ 10s range last year . Any questions happy to discuss ."

One thing constantly mentioned is that they are less tax efficient due to the extra need for rebalancing vs a weighted ETF. I think I'm missing something because my lizard brain tells me that there should inherently be less rebalancing that needs to be done with equal weight since a holding only needs to adjusted if it is removed from the underlying index (in this case S&P 100). Whereas a weighted ETF would also need to remove this same holding entirely if it's removed from the index, plus it also needs to adjust weights periodically to match market caps even when a holding isn't removed from the underlying index.

Only accounts for November at best. We're in a K shaped economy, the poor get poorer and the rich get Aritzia Edit - To everyone that's asking - Yes I'm still holding. Zara is valued at like \\~150bil USD, and Aritizia is only sitting at 11bil USD. There's more than enough room for this to grow 5-10x in the next couple years.",

      "selftext": "Source - [ Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns. Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels. Private prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities. Big tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial. Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere. This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.",

      "selftext": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views. No idea why. Wasn't selling anything, wasn't pumping tickers, just sharing my thinking. Whatever. Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently that's a problem. **What I think is happening:** * Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there. * Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is. * Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment. * That buys a window where risk assets can run. **Then last night happened:** * DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates. * Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" * He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates. * Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. \"Sell America\" trade came back. * But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business. **What this means:** * Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead. * Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026. * Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures. **Path one, the pump:** * Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up. * Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat. * Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips. * Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well. **Path two, the collapse:** * Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions. * \"Sell America\" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together. * Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance. * Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates. * Everything falls apart. **Here's the thing though:** * Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less. * Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios. **Signals I'm watching:** * Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple \"Sell America\" days in a row means it's real. * Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess. * Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done. * Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice. * Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal. * Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something. **When I get out:** * Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours * Defense budgets stall * Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus * Actual military conflict, not just talk **Where I'm positioned:** * Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing * Mix of shares and longer dated options * Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly **Bottom line:** * Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026 * Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies * Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore I'm comfortable with those odds.",

      "selftext_processed": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views . No_idea why . Wasnt selling anything wasnt pumping tickers just sharing my thinking . Whatever . Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently thats a problem . What I think is happening Trump needs the market to rip into midterms . Thats it . Thats the whole thing . Everything else flows from there . Tax cuts deregulation defense spending rate cuts cash handouts to the base . He needs wins he can point to and stock market go up is the easiest win there is . Meanwhile nobody_wants to test him right now . Maduro got snatched . That sent a message . Irans not_going to do anything crazy . Putins going to wait and see . Chinas playing nice for the moment . That buys a window where risk assets can run . Then last night happened DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell . The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed . The actual reason according to Powell himself is that Trump wants lower rates . Powell posted a video Sunday night . Direct quote The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president . He said that . On camera . The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates . Gold hit record highs overnight . Dollar sold off . Futures dumped . Sell America trade came back . But by midday stocks had mostly recovered . Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs . Selloff panic stabilization back to business . What this means Short term volatility . Markets dont like Fed independence being threatened . Chop ahead . Medium term probably bullish If Trump gets his rate cuts whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May thats rocket fuel for stocks . Bad for the dollar bad for inflation eventually but good for equities through 2026 . Long term this is where it splits into two very different futures . Path one the pump Trump gets what he wants . Rates come down . Housing unfreezes . Consumer spending picks up . Defense budget passes . $ 1.5T proposed . Counterdrone AI infrastructure domestic manufacturing all eat . Deregulation everywhere . Crypto rips . Tech rips . Everything rips . Market pumps into midterms . People with risk assets do well . Path two the collapse Trump doesnt stop at pressuring the Fed . He breaks it . Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions . Sell America stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend . Bonds dollar and stocks all falling together . Or he goes further . Starts taking territory seizing assets from other countries because the spending isnt sustainable otherwise . World wants to respond but cant at first because US military dominance . Internal resistance builds . Coup paralysis who knows . Or we stumble into a real conflict . China moves on Taiwan . Russia escalates . Iran miscalculates . Everything falls apart . Heres the thing though Even in path two some stuff still works . Defense doesnt go down during wars . AI infrastructure still matters . Critical minerals become more critical not_less . Unless it goes nuclear . Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios . Signals Im watching Fed independence . If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early major red flag . Multiple Sell America days in a row means its real . Defense budget . $ 1.5T passes defense names keep working . Stalls or gets blocked time to reassess . Supreme Court on Lisa Cook . Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors . He wins Fed independence is done . Credit card cap . Trump floated 10 % today . Banks cratered . If this happens hes willing to break things for short term juice . Foreign treasury holders . China and Japan start dumping in size thats the real signal . Gold . Already at records . Keeps ripping while stocks chop smart money is positioning for something . When I get out Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days not_hours Defense budgets stall Bonds dollar stocks all falling together for a week plus Actual military conflict not_just talk Where Im positioned Themes defense AI infrastructure critical minerals domestic semis some housing Mix of shares and longer dated options Stuff that wins if Trump pumps but doesnt completely die if things get ugly Bottom line Bull case market pumps into midterms I take profits in 2026 Bear case system breaks but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies Worst case nukes and nobody_cares about stonks anymore Im comfortable with those odds ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been digging into Dateline Resources lately, and man, I’m seriously bullish on this one. Ticker is DTR on the ASX, or DTREF over the counter. It’s a gold and rare earths play out in California, right next to that big MP Materials operation, which gives it some real strategic edge in the US market. Their recent drilling at the Colosseum project has been killer, hitting these wide gold intercepts like 295 meters at over a gram per ton from surface. Stuff like that extends way beyond their current resource, and they’re talking about updating the mineral estimate soon. Plus, they’ve got board appointments with some heavy hitters in mining, which tells me the team’s leveling up for bigger things. Price-wise, it’s been on a tear. Shot up from pennies last year to around 32 cents now, with an 18 percent jump just today on solid volume. Yeah, there might be some pullbacks, but gold prices are through the roof, and with AI and tech booming, demand for rare earths is only going higher. They’re eyeing a bankable feasibility study in the first quarter, and if those rare earth targets pan out, this could be massive. I’m loading up because I see huge upside here, especially with the push for domestic critical minerals. No rush to sell, though, I’m in for the long haul with patience. The location, the results, and the market trends all line up. What do you all think? Anyone else holding?",

It ’ s a gold and rare earths play out in California right next to that big MP Materials operation which gives it some real strategic edge in the US market . Their recent drilling at the Colosseum project has been killer hitting these wide gold intercepts like 295 meters at over a gram per ton from surface . Stuff like that extends way beyond their current resource and they ’ re talking about updating the mineral estimate soon . Plus they ’ ve got board appointments with some heavy hitters in mining which tells me the team ’ s leveling up for bigger things . Pricewise it ’ s been on a tear . Shot up from pennies last year to around 32 cents now with an 18 percent jump just today on solid volume . Yeah there might be some pullbacks but gold prices are through the roof and with AI and tech booming demand for rare earths is only going higher . They ’ re eyeing a bankable feasibility study in the first quarter and if those rare earth targets pan out this could be massive . I ’ m loading up because I see huge upside here especially with the push for domestic critical minerals . No_rush to sell though I ’ m in for the long haul with patience . The location the results and the market trends all line up . What do you all think Anyone else holding"

      "selftext": "Hello all, I was hoping you could help me figure out how to rebalance my portfolio. I'm ~40yo, make around $180/yr in a HCOL area. I'm currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation. It's my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades. Whether due to normal economics, political turmoil, dedollarization, end of reserve currency status, purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets. To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner. Here's a brief summary of my accounts. some of the data is obfuscated but you can get the point. Accounts are over multiple lines and all of the rows of that similar name are the accounts holdings. | Account Name | Symbol | Description | Quantity | Current Value (rounded) | Percent Of Account | |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:| | Main Brokerage | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$32,800 | 9.19% | | Main Brokerage | VTI | VANGUARD INDEX FDS VANGUARD TOTAL STK MKT ETF | 601.722 | ~$203,900 | 57.11% | | Main Brokerage | VXUS | VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX FUND | 129.317 | ~$10,000 | 2.80% | | Main Brokerage | BND | VANGUARD BD INDEX FDS TOTAL BND MRKT | 166.292 | ~$12,300 | 3.46% | | Main Brokerage | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 518.761 | ~$98,000 | 27.44% | | Rollover IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Rollover IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 2311.105 | ~$436,400 | 100.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 520 | ~$98,200 | 100.00% | | IRA MOM | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | IRA MOM | FPIFX | FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2020 INVESTOR | 926.689 | ~$15,800 | 59.71% | | IRA MOM | FFFAX | FIDELITY FREEDOM RETIREMENT FUND | 937.059 | ~$10,600 | 40.29% | | 401K | FXAIX | FID 500 INDEX | 690.839 | ~$165,600 | 100.00% | | HYSA | | | | ~$100,000 | 100.00% | I was thinking that in tax advantaged accounts it would be good to move to VXUS or FTIHX. Both total international funds. My goal is to have international exposure. But I also don't want to lose out on growth. Maybe in the Roth IRA have a fund that is more aggressive like Contrafund or Blue chip or tech select. any advice would be great and appreciated. I just don't want to make a mistake and you I know are smarter than I. Thank you",

      "selftext": "When AI heats up, low-priced names often move first because traders pile into what is liquid and headline-sensitive. This is the short list I watch under $6. My 5 AI tickers to watch: **- BBAI** **- REKR** **- RIME** **- NOTE** **- GCT** Why I keep them: RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real run-rate metrics. The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M during 2025 and cited $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike. NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play \"AI SaaS\" sentiment without needing it to be in logistics. When software and AI sentiment improves, names like this can move on category flows. REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play. It is not pure freight optimization, but it is connected to the same idea: AI applied to real-world mobility systems, which can catch a sector bid. Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI, or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates? Do your own homework.",

      "selftext": "Last night Jerome Powell said the DOJ subpoenas into the Fed came alongside pressure from the Trump administration to push rate cuts. He made it clear the Fed won’t bend policy decisions to political pressure. Markets reacted quickly. Futures dipped, the dollar softened, and gold caught a bid, not because policy changed but because confidence in Fed independence matters a lot for equities. This hits stocks in a subtle way. A Fed that looks pressured adds uncertainty around rates, inflation control, and long-term valuations. That’s not great for risk assets that have been pricing a smooth path into 2026. Feels less like short-term drama and more like something investors need to keep on the radar when positioning for the year ahead. Feels like positioning now at these prices is a bit more risk, at least for short term gains.",

I see now that the markets are reacting. DOW down 300 points already and stories of investors being \"nervous\". My question is....why? Why do the markets react at all? We've had chaotic tariff policies, mass protests, an invasion of Venezuela, potential invasions of other countries, the list goes on and on and the market never cared. All those earthshaking events barely moved the needle. We all know Trump meddling with the Fed could (will) lead to disaster, but how is this one any different from the thousand other disasters he's caused?",

Without a clear innovation or growth thesis, it reads less like a long-term investment and more like a legacy institution coasting on inertia, with a real risk of becoming increasingly irrelevant over the next couple of years.",

      "selftext": "I’m 20 from Australia, qualified in a physically demanding trade. I work early mornings, long days. I earn around $1,800 a week after tax including overtime, and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $47 to $55 an hour. I’m posting this because I want honest feedback, not validation. Where am I being naive? Where am I overthinking it? Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me? My general philosophy with money is this: build slowly, test myself honestly, and earn the right to press harder later. I’m playing the long game, but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it. I’m ambitious and not satisfied with “average good outcomes”. I want more, but not recklessly. I’m very aware that consistency beats intensity, and that most people fail because they scale too early, not too late. So this is how I currently run things. I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI, based on about 90% of my income so there’s always buffer. Weekly it looks like this: $400 for core living expenses, $160 for lifestyle, $300 towards a house deposit, $100 for travel or bigger purchases, and $600 into investing. Total is $1,560 a week. Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading. Every category has its own savings account. All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday. No rolling balances, no bullshit. Lifestyle is intentionally tight. Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate, but I work a physical job and I’m not exactly living it up mid-week anyway. I’ve built in room for excess because I know this isn’t sustainable forever. When income grows and life changes, I plan to let myself breathe more. I also keep an $8k emergency fund that I don’t touch, and I’ve got about $7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I’m no longer adding to. For investing, I put $600 a week into US ETFs. Roughly 40% into VGT, 40% into VTI, and 20% into VXUS. This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone. I don’t touch it emotionally. No tinkering, no panic moves, no chasing whatever’s hot this month. Alongside that, I run a small swing trading account, about $2k. This is not income to me. It’s training. I treat trading as skill development, pattern recognition, and learning capital preservation before there’s ever any talk of real leverage. I trade end-of-day swings since I’m in Australia trading US markets. I focus on sector strength, tight consolidations, breakouts and pullbacks, defined risk, and high ADR stocks. Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency. If I ever scale it, the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs, not lifestyle or savings. I’m not relying on trading to save me. I’m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it. Medium term, the next 3–5 years, the goals are straightforward. Keep building a house deposit, buy a property when it actually makes sense, keep ETF compounding going, stay disciplined with trading, and increase income through higher paying roles, specialisation, or side businesses. I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don’t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever. I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn’t care. Fatigue, boredom, temptation, and bad decisions are real. So I’ll ask again, honestly: where am I getting this wrong? Where am I playing it too safe? If you were 20, working a physical job, and thinking long term, what would you change? Am I underutilising my income, or am I actually protecting my future properly? Give me your worst. You old bastards.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m 20 from Australia qualified in a physically demanding trade . I work early mornings long days . I earn around $ 1800 a week after tax including overtime and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $ 47 to $ 55 an hour . I ’ m posting this because I want honest feedback not_validation . Where am I being naive Where am I overthinking it Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me My general philosophy with money is this build slowly test myself honestly and earn the right to press harder later . I ’ m playing the long game but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it . I ’ m ambitious and not_satisfied with “ average good outcomes ” . I want more but not_recklessly . I ’ m very aware that consistency beats intensity and that most people fail because they scale too early not_too late . So this is how I currently run things . I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI based on about 90 % of my income so there ’ s always buffer . Weekly it looks like this $ 400 for core living expenses $ 160 for lifestyle $ 300 towards a house deposit $ 100 for travel or bigger purchases and $ 600 into investing . Total is $ 1560 a week . Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading . Every category has its own savings account . All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday . No_rolling balances no_bullshit . Lifestyle is intentionally tight . Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate but I work a physical job and I ’ m not_exactly living it up midweek anyway . I ’ ve built in room for excess because I know this isn ’ t sustainable forever . When income grows and life changes I plan to let myself breathe more . I also keep an $ 8k emergency fund that I don ’ t touch and I ’ ve got about $ 7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I ’ m no_longer adding to . For investing I put $ 600 a week into US ETFs . Roughly 40 % into VGT 40 % into VTI and 20 % into VXUS . This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone . I don ’ t touch it emotionally . No_tinkering no_panic moves no_chasing whatever ’ s hot this month . Alongside that I run a small swing trading account about $ 2k . This is not_income to me . It ’ s training . I treat trading as skill development pattern recognition and learning capital preservation before there ’ s ever any talk of real leverage . I trade endofday swings since I ’ m in Australia trading US markets . I focus on sector strength tight consolidations breakouts and pullbacks defined risk and high ADR stocks . Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency . If I ever scale it the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs not_lifestyle or savings . I ’ m not_relying on trading to save me . I ’ m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it . Medium term the next 3–5 years the goals are straightforward . Keep building a house deposit buy a property when it actually makes sense keep ETF compounding going stay disciplined with trading and increase income through higher paying roles specialisation or side businesses . I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don ’ t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever . I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn ’ t care . Fatigue boredom temptation and bad decisions are real . So I ’ ll ask again honestly where am I getting this wrong Where am I playing it too safe If you were 20 working a physical job and thinking long term what would you change Am I underutilising my income or am I actually protecting my future properly Give me your worst . You old bastards ."

      "selftext": "[ The Chinese government has said it will review Manus’ deal with Meta announced on December 29 to assess whether it complies with the country’s export controls and technology transfer policies. Manus was founded by Chinese engineers and backed by Chinese investors, the company moved its headquarters to Singapore in June last year. Its product became unavailable in China in July. Around the same time, Manus reportedly laid off its Chinese staff and closed its offices in the country. “Manus left China to pursue international market opportunities just before they materialized,” Lian Jye Su, a Singapore-based tech analyst who monitors AI startups in the region at Omdia, told *Rest of World*. “Its exodus has left the impression that Chinese tech startups can only get international attention if they operate outside of China.” Because of the US-China rivalry, which is causing this strict scrutiny of the deal has, what does it mean for the Chinese startups? Right now, they have the option to either operate within China or give up China to operate internationally. Should this be a concern for China i.e the risk of loosing their talent? Should Chines govt. or investors provide Chinese startups the capital they need so that the Chinese startups do not have to look at Western/ US investments?",

I found out that Victoria secrets (VSCO) drops mid summer and tops out around Christmas at around a 140% gain. Home Depot(HD) falls to its lowest around Christmas and gets to its peak right around mid summer (moderate gains of 20-30%). So I have started a pattern of buying VSCO in the summer, selling in the winter, purchasing HD with the small amount of funds I have, then selling HD in the summer and buying VSCO immediately after the funds have settled. Simply put, any advice on how to do this better?",

I found out that Victoria secrets VSCO drops mid summer and tops out around Christmas at around a 140 % gain . Home DepotHD falls to its lowest around Christmas and gets to its peak right around mid summer moderate gains of 2030 % . So I have started a pattern of buying VSCO in the summer selling in the winter purchasing HD with the small amount of funds I have then selling HD in the summer and buying VSCO immediately after the funds have settled . Simply put any advice on how to do this better"

      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

Is a basket of basically Mag7 stocks - with some data center and defense additions - a solid portfolio for next 5-10 years or is concentration risk too much? (also got another 100-120k coming to deploy in a few months) Here are my 3 scenarios: 1 - MAG7 stocks with highest weight in AMZN, with some extra picks - TSM, SHLD, VRT, PWR, RYCEY, ABBNY (yea all at highs) 2 - Keep large base in VOO(60-70%?) - add high confiction singles - AMZM, NVDA, TSM, VRT, SHLD 3 - just 100% VOO and dont pick winners My brain is telling me 1 is too high on concentration risk but on the other hand the market is basically just the mag 7 right now anyway. any thoughts appreciated",

      "selftext": "I’ve been messing around with a couple of “AI stock predictor” tools lately. They spit out neat scores, heat maps, even daily picks. The backtests look like a dream. In real time it has been more mixed for me. A few nice wins, a couple of facepalms, and a lot of “would this have worked if I didn’t cherry pick it.” My hangup is the black box vibe. If I can’t see what the model is actually keying off of, I’m basically just replacing my hunches with a robot’s hunches. I already let AI write my grocery list. Not sure I’m ready to let it steer my kid’s college fund. Right now I’m treating these as a second opinion and a watchlist filter. Paper trading first, keeping position sizes small, and sanity checking with fundamentals and risk. Curious if anyone here has a real process for evaluating AI signals. Walk-forward testing? Out-of-sample periods? Shadow portfolios? If you’ve tried an AI picker that actually helped your process, what made it useful instead of hype? Features you found essential vs gimmicky? Would love to hear how you’re integrating this stuff. NFA, obviously.",

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

Don ’ t expect any big numbers I have a small account 10K The inverse iron condor strat So a regular iron condor is simple enough . An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit defined riskreward long theta short Vega delta neutral at start . The DTE is your choice but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty which makes sense you want the price to stay between your short strikes and thus let the entire spread expire worthless . The other wellknown strat is a reverse or long iron condor which is an otm debit put and call spread and this time it ’ s short theta long Vega delta neutral at start . This one you want the price to move drastically up or down . With me so far Congrats you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly . So what ’ s different with the inverse iron condor Simple my problem was this I hate entering a trade for a debit . And my thesis Markets don ’ t stay the same in a longer period of time . Solution open a fully itm credit callput spread for a net CREDIT short theta LONG Vega delta neutral at start and we want price to move drastically now . Give yourself a bit of time for market to move 95DTE approx and bob ’ s your uncle . But you tell me you ’ re really dumb . You could ’ ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same PL outlook . Aren ’ t you even thinking about early assignment Why yes dear reader . You are absolutely correct . Because of early assignment risk I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is Europeanstyle . As for the condor I forgor 💀 really that ’ s the only reason . Do a regular credit condor if you want I ’ m not_your mom . So to sum up buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry same strike widths apart . Market dumps you win . Market rallies you win Market flatlines you lose . If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT ’ s help I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole . For now here ’ s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don ’ t want to mess around with early assignment risk ."

We’ve already lifted to $23, but I’m not even thinking about selling. The \"MBS God-Candle\" just ignited. Trump just ordered a $200B mortgage bond buy, pushing 30-year rates under 6% overnight. The Trump administration is perfectly aligned with $RKT because housing affordability is a top agenda item. Institutional giants and advocates like Bill Pulte and Bill Ackman are already vocal about crushing these spreads to force affordability. The real alpha for 2026 is Rocket’s transformation into a tech-driven financial powerhouse. By integrating the Redfin search funnel and Mr. Cooper servicing book, they now own the entire Search-to-Close lifecycle. As the market realizes Rocket scales like a SaaS company rather than a cyclical bank, I'm expecting massive multiple expansion. I like the stock even more than before. I still like rockets. See you regards on the moon. 🚀🚀🚀",

      "selftext": "My two cents on Petco. Petco’s equity is priced for bankruptcy, while its cash flow, liquidity, and credit markets price it as a surviving, self-funding business, creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize. The company is trading at \\~5.5x EBITDA and a \\~11-13% FCF yield on normalized numbers. The balance sheet, while levered, is structured with a long runway (2028) and flexible covenants. The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation. Just a point I want to make, most screeners show Petco trading at EV/EBITDA of \\~11x, whilst showing the EV as \\~$3.55 billion. I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet. The cost of these leases have already hit the P&L through either COGS or SG&A. EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders. The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric. If we want to include operating leases as part of EV, the we should use the EBITDAR metric. Alternatively, we can just strip out the operating leases. The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event. This framing is wrong. Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF, a covenant lite capital structure, no meaningful debt maturities until 2028, credit markets signalling survival, not distress. The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not support. For equity to be impaired, three conditions must occur simultaneously: 1. Material EBITDA collapse 2. Inability to service interest 3. Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21% YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue, interest is covered \\~3x, the \\~$1.6 billion Term Loan is covenant-lite and matures in 2028, the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability. Petco is now self-funding and does not rely on capital markets to operate. This is not a growth story. Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization, continued FCF generation, gradual deleveraging toward \\~3x net leverage. Under this base case, bankruptcy risk collapses, short interest (\\~20%) unwinds and the stock rerates from \\~5.5x to \\~7x EV/EBITDA. This implies \\~50–70% upside without heroic assumptions. Even in a stressed scenario (continued revenue decline, margin pressure, tariffs), interest remains covered, FCF remains positive, and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months. Downside is owning a slow growth, cash generative retailer, not a zero. The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not support. If the company simply stabilizes, the equity is materially undervalued. Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this.",

      "selftext_processed": "My two cents on Petco . Petco ’ s equity is priced for bankruptcy while its cash flow liquidity and credit markets price it as a surviving selffunding business creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize . The company is trading at 5.5x EBITDA and a 1113 % FCF yield on normalized numbers . The balance sheet while levered is structured with a long runway 2028 and flexible covenants . The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation . Just a point I want to make most screeners show Petco trading at EVEBITDA of 11x whilst showing the EV as $ 3.55 billion . I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet . The cost of these leases have already hit the PL through either COGS or SGA . EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders . The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric . If we want to include operating leases as part of EV the we should use the EBITDAR metric . Alternatively we can just strip out the operating leases . The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event . This framing is wrong . Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF a covenant lite capital structure no_meaningful debt maturities until 2028 credit markets signalling survival not_distress . The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not_support . For equity to be impaired three conditions must occur simultaneously 1 . Material EBITDA collapse 2 . Inability to service interest 3 . Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21 % YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue interest is covered 3x the $ 1.6 billion Term Loan is covenantlite and matures in 2028 the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability . Petco is now selffunding and does not_rely on capital markets to operate . This is not_a growth story . Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization continued FCF generation gradual deleveraging toward 3x net leverage . Under this base case bankruptcy risk collapses short interest 20 % unwinds and the stock rerates from 5.5x to 7x EVEBITDA . This implies 50–70 % upside without heroic assumptions . Even in a stressed scenario continued revenue decline margin pressure tariffs interest remains covered FCF remains positive and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months . Downside is owning a slow growth cash generative retailer not_a zero . The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not_support . If the company simply stabilizes the equity is materially undervalued . Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this ."

The problem was that I definitely didnt do any research on the stocks I bought. I let myself be guided by articles from unreputable sources and people whose interest was simply to get you to buy their subscription for \"stock recommendations\" and literally paid the price, The total amount of 2200€ I invested back then are only worth 1000€ today. Luckily, I learned a lot since then, gratuated, started investing a fixed amount of money into the S&P on a monthly basis and bought a few stocks I actually did my own research on. Basically, I turned it around and I am now much happier with how my portfolio looks today than it did around 5~6 years ago. Still, everytime I scroll down to these stocks in my portfolio I get embarrased of my own actions and even though I know it would be the correct move, it's hard to sell these stocks at a loss. I know that by selling I have to finally admit to myself that my actions were stupid, and that's not easy. Sure, the amount of money is small compared to my portfolio today or what I earn now that I have a good job, but when it comes to these stocks my mind goes back to 2020 version of myself when I sent money from my regular banking account into my investment account for the first time and feeling Like a king for investing into the stock market that I Always heard about in the news. Somehow it kept me from acting rationally all these years.

      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls. Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not a financial professional in any capacity.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."

      "selftext": "I currently run my portfolio and trades through a self-directed investment account through my bank. I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app. It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock. Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned, I and considering moving everything to robinhood. Almost every picture I see of other’s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining user-friendly. The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky. It only loads through a pop-up window, and closes every time I leave the app. It does not provide enough of information on the tearsheet, so I have to go in and out, reloading the page every time I am researching. There are also some stocks that are not available to purchase when I search for them (KRKNF). The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock. I may be misinformed, so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood. My understanding is that yes, robinhood is FDIC insured, but behind the screen, when you “buy” a stock, you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool. When you “buy” a stock on the app, Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood. What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform? Would it be worth transferring my portfolio? Additionally, are there any other secure, FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked?",

I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app . It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock . Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned I and considering moving everything to robinhood . Almost every picture I see of other ’ s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining userfriendly . The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky . It only loads through a popup window and closes every time I leave the app . It does not_provide enough of information on the tearsheet so I have to go in and out reloading the page every time I am researching . There are also some stocks that are not_available to purchase when I search for them KRKNF . The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock . I may be misinformed so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood . My understanding is that yes robinhood is FDIC insured but behind the screen when you “ buy ” a stock you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool . When you “ buy ” a stock on the app Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood . What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform Would it be worth transferring my portfolio Additionally are there any other secure FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked"

      "title": "Is MSTR Trading Like a Bargain RN... $60B BTC for $45-48B Market Cap?",
      "selftext": "As of the latest update (Jan 5, 2026), Strategy holds 673,783 BTC. With Bitcoin sitting around $90,600 today, that's roughly $61 BILLION in Bitcoin treasury value alone (closed Jan 9 at $157.33/share, market cap around $45.5B on most trackers). the math: We're getting $61B worth of Bitcoin for a $45-48B valuation. That's a 20-25%+ discount to fair NAV, something that almost NEVER happens with MSTR. Historically it trades at massive premiums (50-100%+) because of Saylor's leverage genius, future acquisition potential, and the \"Bitcoin yield\" play. But right now? After the recent volatility, unrealized loss noise, and all the MSCI FUD, the market seems like the biggest bargain in years. MSCI backed off full delisting and confirmed retention (with some new share caps), which removed the forced-selling overhang and sparked relief pump last week. Yet the stock still hasn't fully repriced the true value. Add in the fact they just stacked another 1,286 BTC early Jan, boosted cash reserves to $2.25B, probably ready for more buys, this discount won't last once BTC pushes back toward $100k+. This feels like a good entry point. Does this add up? Think we'll see premium flip back hard on the next leg up?",

With Bitcoin sitting around $ 90600 today thats roughly $ 61 BILLION in Bitcoin treasury value alone closed Jan 9 at $ 157.33share market cap around $ 45.5B on most trackers . the math Were getting $ 61B worth of Bitcoin for a $ 4548B valuation . Thats a 2025 % discount to fair NAV something that almost NEVER_happens with MSTR . Historically it trades at massive premiums 50100 % because of Saylors leverage genius future acquisition potential and the Bitcoin yield play . But right now After the recent volatility unrealized loss noise and all the MSCI FUD the market seems like the biggest bargain in years . MSCI backed off full delisting and confirmed retention with some new share caps which removed the forcedselling overhang and sparked relief pump last week . Yet the stock still hasnt fully repriced the true value . Add in the fact they just stacked another 1286 BTC early Jan boosted cash reserves to $ 2.25B probably ready for more buys this discount wont last once BTC pushes back toward $ 100k . This feels like a good entry point . Does this add up Think well see premium flip back hard on the next leg up"

      "title": "Looking for portfolio feedback- GGUS/UGL/Senior AUD bank bonds",
      "selftext": "I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this long-term strategy as an Australian investor (40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% AUD cash/senior bank bonds, 10% aussie miners/personal stock picks) with 20% bands, yearly rebalancing), where it could go wrong, and for constructive critique. The basic premise is that over the next 7-10 years, the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD (mean-reversion), and a number of other considerations, like higher US inflation to be expected. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold, but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower. In addition, I do not see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal. US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of Medicare/Social Security, and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze, so only inflation or higher taxation are viable long-term solutions (unless the US gets rid of the above). Given the political paralysis, higher taxation is unlikely, and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office (besides tariffs, which do not meaningfully compensate for tax cuts). GGUS is 80-100% overall AUD currency-hedged S&P500 exposure, UGL is 60%ish USD-denominated gold exposure, and the 20% cash/Australian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash. There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered, and how this portfolio would play out. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **1. War/Significant geopolitical event** GGUS will likely crash, UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos. Enables rebalancing. I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease (climate refugees etc.). **2. Persistent US inflation** Since I'm hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not a major concern for me, and since economically companies price based on inflation, I'm economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates (expected in the near term). Gold is also useful for this. **3. Stock market crash (bubble popping)** This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping. In the near term, stocks will fall. Gold may be mixed effects, there for rebalancing. Cash also there for rebalancing. Appears there's a long-term mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful. **4. Deflation** I don't believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in- central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates. However, under this scenario, the portfolio does lose considerable value. **5. Tariff death spiral** Stocks will crash, gold will likely soar as it's not dependent on government policy. Rebalance, buy the dip, TACO. **6. Bond vigilantes** This is possible in the next 5-10 years if inflation is too high and long-term bond investors are not happy with a dovish Fed's low interest rates. Cash/short-term senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing, and I'm happy to hold. Gold/cash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS. **7. The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds** I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio. Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting, slightly higher, but an additional risk I'm willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash. **8. Gold prices decrease** This is possible- gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing, likely because of saturation from miners. Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL, I may experience more losses as a result, but for me it's worth the insurance policy. In the long term, it's an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease, and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation. So I'm fine with this risk. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any future likely scenarios I haven't considered? I've also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past (\\~14-15%/annum) with okay drawdowns, not a predictor of future returns, but still. Ideally, I still would've preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40% portion (for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay), but that doesn't really exist in a liquid form. Perhaps the only semi-likely scenario I've thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together, but that's unlikely. **TL;DR:** I'm a young early-20's Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually. I'm stress testing a 40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% senior Australian bank bonds (QPON)/10% fun money portfolio (with 20% bands and yearly rebalancing) and would like some feedback/thoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term. The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes, and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons (see US debt-to-GDP), enabling higher returns in currency-hedged leveraged S&P500 and gold. If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF I'd be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40% portion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Id like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this longterm strategy as an Australian investor 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % AUD cashsenior bank bonds 10 % aussie minerspersonal stock picks with 20 % bands yearly rebalancing where it could go wrong and for constructive critique . The basic premise is that over the next 710 years the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD meanreversion and a number of other considerations like higher US inflation to be expected . This is for a number of reasons mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower . In addition I do not_see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debttoGDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal . US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of MedicareSocial Security and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze so only inflation or higher taxation are viable longterm solutions unless the US gets rid of the above . Given the political paralysis higher taxation is unlikely and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office besides tariffs which do not_meaningfully compensate for tax cuts . GGUS is 80100 % overall AUD currencyhedged SP500 exposure UGL is 60 % ish USDdenominated gold exposure and the 20 % cashAustralian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash . There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered and how this portfolio would play out . 1 . WarSignificant geopolitical event GGUS will likely crash UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos . Enables rebalancing . I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease climate refugees etc .. 2 . Persistent US inflation Since Im hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not_a major concern for me and since economically companies price based on inflation Im economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates expected in the near term . Gold is also useful for this . 3 . Stock market crash bubble popping This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping . In the near term stocks will fall . Gold may be mixed effects there for rebalancing . Cash also there for rebalancing . Appears theres a longterm mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful . 4 . Deflation I dont believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates . However under this scenario the portfolio does lose considerable value . 5 . Tariff death spiral Stocks will crash gold will likely soar as its not_dependent on government policy . Rebalance buy the dip TACO . 6 . Bond vigilantes This is possible in the next 510 years if inflation is too high and longterm bond investors are not_happy with a dovish Feds low interest rates . Cashshortterm senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing and Im happy to hold . Goldcash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS . 7 . The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio . Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting slightly higher but an additional risk Im willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash . 8 . Gold prices decrease This is possible gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing_likely because of saturation from miners . Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL I may experience more losses as a result but for me its worth the insurance policy . In the long term its an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation . So Im fine with this risk . Are there any future likely scenarios I havent considered Ive also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past 1415 % annum with okay drawdowns not_a predictor of future returns but still . Ideally I still wouldve preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40 % portion for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay but that doesnt really exist in a liquid form . Perhaps the only semilikely scenario Ive thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together but thats unlikely . TLDR Im a young early20s Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually . Im stress testing a 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % senior Australian bank bonds QPON10 % fun money portfolio with 20 % bands and yearly rebalancing and would like some feedbackthoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term . The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons see US debttoGDP enabling higher returns in currencyhedged leveraged SP500 and gold . If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF Id be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40 % portion ."

      "selftext": "Okay, so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not gotten a job. My sister is a data analyst who makes about $120k. Her whole team is getting fired (yahoo) and she has been saying how much trouble she's having in trying to get a senior data analyst job. She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help. She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs. When I look at online forums(like reddit) in regards to IT, Software, data, etc jobs... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only senior-level jobs are being sought out for. Juniors are flat out not getting hired. Now, as the tech market is clearly not doing well, I've talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields... I get the gist that nobody is having an easy time in the white collar industry. That white-collar is oversaturated... I'm guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from mid-level and senior-level positions. So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field... wouldn't this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market? I can see how in the short-term that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expenditures(employee expenses), but wouldn't this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm? Are these major ceo's even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports? Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up? Essentially the upper-middle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population. Btw my ASTS position is worth $500k w/ cost basis at $6.50 and I'm only working a part time job right now(my whole life actually). I went all-in on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021. I've honestly never had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected. The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $100-200B mkt cap company one day. Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs, they have 3billion current subscribers. This is not counting the people that live in remote areas and don't even own cell phones... the potential is enormous. That said, I want to move out of my parents(I'm 31M) and am scared a recession will kill my gains. I want to hold, but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $200k and get an apartment while I search for a full-time job. I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician, as I have a lot of experience(+10 yrs), but I have 3 degrees. In Philosophy, History, and Comp-Sci from a T-50 public university in the country. I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig, but seemingly nobody wants me. I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to. Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays?? What're your thoughts on AI, the economy, job market and their relationship with the stock market. Thanks...",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not_gotten a job . My sister is a data analyst who makes about $ 120k . Her whole team is getting fired yahoo and she has been saying how much trouble shes having in trying to get a senior data analyst job . She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help . She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs . When I look at online forumslike reddit in regards to IT Software data etc jobs ... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only seniorlevel jobs are being sought out for . Juniors are flat out not_getting hired . Now as the tech market is clearly not_doing well Ive talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields ... I get the gist that nobody_is having an easy time in the white collar industry . That whitecollar is oversaturated ... Im guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from midlevel and seniorlevel positions . So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field ... wouldnt this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market I can see how in the shortterm that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expendituresemployee expenses but wouldnt this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm Are these major ceos even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up Essentially the uppermiddle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population . Btw my ASTS position is worth $ 500k w cost basis at $ 6.50 and Im only working a part time job right nowmy whole life actually . I went allin on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021 . Ive honestly never_had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected . The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $ 100200B mkt cap company one day . Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs they have 3billion current subscribers . This is not_counting the people that live in remote areas and dont even own cell phones ... the potential is enormous . That said I want to move out of my parentsIm 31M and am scared a recession will kill my gains . I want to hold but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $ 200k and get an apartment while I search for a fulltime job . I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician as I have a lot of experience10 yrs but I have 3 degrees . In Philosophy History and CompSci from a T50 public university in the country . I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig but seemingly nobody_wants me . I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to . Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays Whatre your thoughts on AI the economy job market and their relationship with the stock market . Thanks ..."

These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava, down over like 70% from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend.. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago. 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs. Was down a half a month ago. Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI.. so its a good sign I think? And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and. Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I haven't even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if they're still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m currently looking to strengthen my portfolio with a long-term position (5 to 7 years) and I’m torn between Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). I already have a solid foundation in my portfolio (about 88- 90% in VEQT ETF), and I want to use my remaining weight to pick one of these two tech giants. I’m an investor who values stability but is looking for that extra growth \"boost\" over the next decade. My thoughts so far: Google: I like their dominance in search and the massive potential of YouTube. However, I’m curious about how people feel regarding their AI integration (Gemini) compared to competitors. Amazon: Their AWS margins are impressive and the retail side seems to be getting more efficient, but I wonder if the growth ceiling is closer than Google’s. My setup: I trade on Wealthsimple and I’m planning to hold regardless of short-term volatility. My question: For a 5-7 year hold, which one do you think offers the best risk/reward ratio right now? Should I favor Google’s advertising moat or Amazon’s cloud/logistics powerhouse? Thanks for your insights!\"",

Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $12BN when their market cap was $7BN. These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need. ALK has $2BN of debt secured against theirs. So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly, investors should pay very close attention. If this behaviour is not openly discussed and disclosed, but is eased into financial statements without comment, investors should get away first and ask questions later. # The Sparkling Diamond: Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership. Alaska is tied to Bank of America. Here's how it works: Bank of America uses Alaska's miles to induce customers to use their credit cards. When a customer earns miles, Alaska bills Bank of America immediately. The exact numbers aren't disclosed, but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays. When Alaska receives this cash, here's how it's accounted for: The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance - not the cost, the fair value. Per Alaska's 2023 10-K (the last time it was disclosed), this is about 0.75 cents per mile. This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability. The remaining 0.50 cents? That goes straight into \"Loyalty Other Revenue\" - i.e. profit - because there are no further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents. This is a stable, predictable relationship. I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022. Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies, but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent. Until Q2 2025. # The 10σ Anomaly |Period|Alaska σ|United σ|Delta σ|American σ| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Q3 2022|0.58|0.25|1.10|0.27| |Q4 2022|1.06|1.96|1.21|1.07| |Q1 2023|0.40|0.45|0.26|0.19| |Q2 2023|0.23|1.91|1.19|2.38| |Q3 2023|0.11|0.35|0.42|0.28| |Q4 2023|1.01|0.11|1.58|1.54| |Q1 2024|1.25|0.24|1.17|0.31| |Q2 2024|0.47|0.32|0.18|0.25| |Q3 2024|0.84|0.68|0.77|0.41| |Q4 2024|1.68|1.22|0.18|0.48| |Q1 2025|1.41|0.12|1.06|0.28| |Q2 2025|**10.40**|0.01|1.33|0.48| |Q3 2025|0.16|0.12|1.23|0.14| In Q2 2025, Alaska's issuance-to-revenue ratio deviated 10.40 standard deviations from its historical baseline. This isn't the universe ending though statistically it would be. This is a ratio that has completely broken down. There is $180M of liability (points issued) with no corresponding loyalty revenue. The points appeared on the books, but the profit that should accompany them did not. The temptation to grasp at Alaska's recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some re-balancing of the two programmes is irresistible. But where is the expense recorded? Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting? Not there either. Now look at the other side of the balance sheet. Receivables from Affinity Card Partners (read: Bank of America) jumped from $111M to $306M in a single quarter. Something has happened here. Some similar transactions have occurred. You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure. There is none. # The Sneaky Restatement That's not all that happened in Q2. Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10-Q, we find this rather vague statement: Every character in that note is drafted to make you think: \"This doesn't concern me.\" And if you did dig, you'd have a hard time finding what changed. It's two pages away from the affected number. What changed? They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $58M - a 49% revision. Why? No explanation. Just... cute. # Where Did the Money Go? Let's see what washed out in Q3. Receivables from BofA dropped by $129M. You'd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected. But look at the operating cash flow statement. It's not there. No corresponding inflow. Instead, $120M appeared in \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" What happened here? As an investor, I was confidently awaiting $120M in operating cash flow. Instead, all I know now is that as a non-current asset, there is no expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months. No explanation whatsoever. # Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too There's more trouble in this loyalty programme. When customers redeem miles, they can use them on Alaska's own aircraft or on partner airlines. On Alaska's own metal, the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway. But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash. In Q2 and Q3 2025, something extraordinary is happening. The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward - which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme. Partner redemption went from 13.5% of total in 2024, up by 400bp for the same period in 2025. If this is a step up or more significantly, a trend, then that is a material input to the $12BN. |Metric|Q1 2025|Q2 2025|Q3 2025| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |BofA Receivables|$111M|$306M|$177M| |Other Non-Current Assets|\\-|$316M|$436M| |Issuance/Revenue Ratio|Normal|10.40σ|Normal| The Q2 spike appeared. The Q3 \"resolution\" moved money sideways rather than into cash. The ratio reverted as quickly as it broke. This is not how normal business operations look. The absence of any disclosures point in the opposite direction. # What This Means I'm not alleging fraud. I'm pointing out that: 1. Alaska's loyalty economics produced a statistical impossibility in Q2 2025 2. The corresponding balance sheet movements cannot be reconciled from public disclosures 3. A $58M prior-period revision was buried with deliberately vague language 4. $120M migrated to non-current assets without explanation 5. Partner redemption economics are shifting materially A loyalty programme worth $12BN, securing $2BN of debt, with a 10σ accounting anomaly and no management commentary. That demands explanation. Alaska hasn't provided one.",

Its ungodly . Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $ 12BN when their market cap was $ 7BN . These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need . ALK has $ 2BN of debt secured against theirs . So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly investors should pay very close attention . If this behaviour is not_openly discussed and disclosed but is eased into financial statements without comment investors should get away first and ask questions later . The Sparkling Diamond Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership . Alaska is tied to Bank of America . Heres how it works Bank of America uses Alaskas miles to induce customers to use their credit cards . When a customer earns miles Alaska bills Bank of America immediately . The exact numbers arent disclosed but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays . When Alaska receives this cash heres how its accounted for The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance not_the cost the fair value . Per Alaskas 2023 10K the last time it was disclosed this is about 0.75 cents per mile . This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability . The remaining 0.50 cents That goes straight into Loyalty Other Revenue i.e . profit because there are no_further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents . This is a stable predictable relationship . I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022 . Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent . Until Q2 2025 .

This isnt the universe ending though statistically it would be . This is a ratio that has completely broken down . There is $ 180M of liability points issued with no_corresponding loyalty revenue . The points appeared on the books but the profit that should accompany them did not_The temptation to grasp at Alaskas recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some rebalancing of the two programmes is irresistible . But where is the expense recorded Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting Not_there either . Now look at the other side of the balance sheet . Receivables from Affinity Card Partners read Bank of America jumped from $ 111M to $ 306M in a single quarter . Something has happened here . Some similar transactions have occurred . You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure . There is none . The Sneaky Restatement Thats not_all that happened in Q2 . Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10Q we find this rather vague statement Every character in that note is drafted to make you think This doesnt concern me . And if you did dig youd have a hard time finding what changed . Its two pages away from the affected number . What changed They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $ 58M a 49 % revision . Why No_explanation . Just ... cute . Where Did the Money Go Lets see what washed out in Q3 . Receivables from BofA dropped by $ 129M . Youd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected . But look at the operating cash flow statement . Its not_there . No_corresponding inflow . Instead $ 120M appeared in Other NonCurrent Assets . What happened here As an investor I was confidently awaiting $ 120M in operating cash flow . Instead all I know now is that as a noncurrent asset there is no_expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months . No_explanation whatsoever . Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too Theres more trouble in this loyalty programme . When customers redeem miles they can use them on Alaskas own aircraft or on partner airlines . On Alaskas own metal the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway . But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash . In Q2 and Q3 2025 something extraordinary is happening . The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme . Partner redemption went from 13.5 % of total in 2024 up by 400bp for the same period in 2025 . If this is a step up or more significantly a trend then that is a material input to the $ 12BN . MetricQ1 2025Q2 2025Q3 2025 BofA Receivables $ 111M $ 306M $ 177M Other NonCurrent Assets $ 316M $ 436M IssuanceRevenue RatioNormal10.40σNormal The Q2 spike appeared . The Q3 resolution moved money sideways rather than into cash . The ratio reverted as quickly as it broke . This is not_how normal business operations look . The absence of any disclosures point in the opposite direction . What This Means Im not_alleging fraud . Im pointing out that 1 . Alaskas loyalty economics produced a statistical impossibility in Q2 2025 2 . The corresponding balance sheet movements can not be reconciled from public disclosures 3 . A $ 58M priorperiod revision was buried with deliberately vague language 4 . $ 120M migrated to noncurrent assets without explanation 5 . Partner redemption economics are shifting materially A loyalty programme worth $ 12BN securing $ 2BN of debt with a 10σ accounting anomaly and no_management commentary . That demands explanation . Alaska hasnt provided one ."

      "title": "My Clients Buying Silver: A Criticism",
      "selftext": "I’ll summarize my diatribe by saying- the moment you hear of people that simply cannot afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number, it’s time to reconsider your exposure. 2018, I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio‘s hedge against inflation. I got push back - “what inflation?”. my rebuttal was and has always been that we don’t invest solely based on what’s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude. inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises. rates were near zero, and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same. right around the time silver crossed the $40 range, I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buying/investing in silver. it seemed to be all the rage. many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position. For them, it was fine. but for the rest of the bunch, the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal. To what end will you invest in silver? where are you hoping to see it? why suddenly now? Mind you, our monetary policy and debt expansion is not anywhere near the free-and-easy regime we saw between ‘18 and ‘21. But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own. They watch what others do, see the price run up, catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it’s ‘all systems go’. My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price. could silver move to $100/oz? surely. could also reach $1,000. my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves. if theres a case for $100, then there’s also a case for $50. the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong? what would that loss do to your time horizon? the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out. this is also costly. opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis. Having said all that, I love silver. It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time. But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom: your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio. Taxes on silver gains, unlike cap gains on stocks, are inescapable. The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure. How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS? and does 28% sound like a fun haircut to get? Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run. Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room. 3 if you’re weird. Point being, it takes more angles to house a decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ll summarize my diatribe by saying the moment you hear of people that simply can not afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number it ’ s time to reconsider your exposure . 2018 I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio ‘ s hedge against inflation . I got push back “ what inflation ” . my rebuttal was and has always been that we don ’ t invest solely based on what ’ s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude . inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises . rates were near zero and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same . right around the time silver crossed the $ 40 range I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buyinginvesting in silver . it seemed to be all the rage . many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position . For them it was fine . but for the rest of the bunch the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal . To what end will you invest in silver where are you hoping to see it why suddenly now Mind you our monetary policy and debt expansion is not_anywhere near the freeandeasy regime we saw between ‘ 18 and ‘ 21 . But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own . They watch what others do see the price run up catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it ’ s ‘ all systems go ’ . My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price . could silver move to $ 100oz surely . could also reach $ 1000 . my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves . if theres a case for $ 100 then there ’ s also a case for $ 50 . the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong what would that loss do to your time horizon the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out . this is also costly . opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis . Having said all that I love silver . It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time . But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio . Taxes on silver gains unlike cap gains on stocks are inescapable . The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure . How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS and does 28 % sound like a fun haircut to get Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run . Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room . 3 if you ’ re weird . Point being it takes more angles to house a decision ."

      "title": "Portfolio Review - Sanity Check",
      "selftext": "Hello! 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio. This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity, with a 20+ year horizon, aiming for long-term growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns. My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap (multiple S&P 500 funds, total market funds, growth funds, etc.). I’m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile. (Roth IRA is handled separately.) Below is how my current allocation looks today. As you’ll see, there’s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures. # Current Portfolio Allocation |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FXAIX|17.40%| |FDLXX|9.99%| |FSKAX|7.83%| |FZILX|5.95%| |SPY|5.90%| |VTI|5.47%| |VUG|5.44%| |FZROX|4.85%| |SOXX|4.61%| |FSELX|4.40%| |FTBFX|4.03%| |FSMDX|3.47%| |QQQ|3.44%| |FBGRX|3.20%| |VOO|3.05%| |FBALX|2.67%| |FCNTX|2.38%| |FSPTX|1.73%| |FPURX|1.57%| |FSPGX|1.19%| |FNILX|0.77%| |IAUM|0.43%| |FTIHX|0.23%| Option 1: ETF-based target allocation I’m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity, portability (in case I ever move away from Fidelity), and tax efficiency in a taxable account. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |VTI|25%| |VOO|25%| |VXUS|20%| |BND|10%| |VUG|8%| |SOXX|5%| |VO|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Option 2: Fidelity-native target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity, this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FSKAX|25%| |FXAIX|25%| |FTIHX|20%| |FTBFX|10%| |FSPGX|8%| |FSELX|5%| |FSMDX|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Looking for feedback on - Does this allocation make sense for 38 / long-term taxable investing? Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts? Would you simplify this further? Thoughts on VTI + VOO together vs a single US equity fund? Not trying to chase returns, mainly want something simple, diversified, and easy to stick with long term. Appreciate any input. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio . This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity with a 20 year horizon aiming for longterm growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns . My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap multiple SP 500 funds total market funds growth funds etc .. I ’ m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile . Roth IRA is handled separately . Below is how my current allocation looks today . As you ’ ll see there ’ s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures . Current Portfolio Allocation Ticker % of Account FXAIX17.40 % FDLXX9.99 % FSKAX7.83 % FZILX5.95 % SPY5.90 % VTI5.47 % VUG5.44 % FZROX4.85 % SOXX4.61 % FSELX4.40 % FTBFX4.03 % FSMDX3.47 % QQQ3.44 % FBGRX3.20 % VOO3.05 % FBALX2.67 % FCNTX2.38 % FSPTX1.73 % FPURX1.57 % FSPGX1.19 % FNILX0.77 % IAUM0.43 % FTIHX0.23 % Option 1 ETFbased target allocation I ’ m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity portability in case I ever move away from Fidelity and tax efficiency in a taxable account . Ticker % of Account VTI25 % VOO25 % VXUS20 % BND10 % VUG8 % SOXX5 % VO5 % FDLXX2 % Option 2 Fidelitynative target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds . Ticker % of Account FSKAX25 % FXAIX25 % FTIHX20 % FTBFX10 % FSPGX8 % FSELX5 % FSMDX5 % FDLXX2 % Looking for feedback on Does this allocation make sense for 38 longterm taxable investing Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts Would you simplify this further Thoughts on VTI VOO together vs a single US equity fund Not_trying to chase returns mainly want something simple diversified and easy to stick with long term . Appreciate any input . Thanks"

      "selftext": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term (50 years). I planned to just put money in the s&p500 monthly, but I learned about small cap value + momentum being theoretically more rewarding. This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean. Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that. This post is for people that find it interesting to look at, but any judgement/advice is also welcome of course. My strategy is the following: Average ROI of US SCV ETF + World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF + World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months. The higher one gets a weight of 70. This is the dynamic factor allocation (relative performance between the factors, cross-factor momentum). The ETF’s are: ZPRV on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF (Italian stock exchange) on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF (English stock exchange) on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IE-domicile. Monthly contributions of €750 (at first, might increase when financial situation changes) with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 70/30 or 30/70 between the factors (SCV and momentum). Realistically between 20-40 and 60-80 is fine. Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 50/50, but +-10 difference is fine. Yearly rebalancing on fixed date (my birthday) if necessary. When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high, I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay. EDIT: based in Europe.",

      "selftext": "Reports have indicated the Trump admin is meeting with home builders and will make an announcement at the world economic forum later this month. Seems like one of the admins priorities will be home building to close home deficits and an executive order is going to be signed. Which home builder stock do you think will benefit the most of the ones below? • Pultegroup (PHM): I think this will be the one to go to. Third largest home builder in volume, but much more importantly Bill Pulte the grandson of the founder is also currently the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Need I say more? • Lennar (LEN): second choice. Want to say this is the second largest homebuilder could be confusing this though. More importantly Stuart Miller (CEO) was part of Trump’s strategic and policy forum in the first admin. Also he hinted at talking to Trump admin late 2025 early this year about affordability/supply (in meetings that included other home builders). • D.R Horton (DHI): A high volume home builder, this company is actually the highest volume builder in the states. But I couldn’t find links to the admin here. Any other thoughts? Thinking of opening a position into lennar or pulte next wk. Edit: • Beacon Roofing Supply (QXO): JBSwerve mentioned QXO, which sells sideboards, windows, and roofing (main product). Kushner on the board",

      "selftext_processed": "Reports have indicated the Trump admin is meeting with home builders and will make an announcement at the world economic forum later this month . Seems like one of the admins priorities will be home building to close home deficits and an executive order is going to be signed . Which home builder stock do you think will benefit the most of the ones below • Pultegroup PHM I think this will be the one to go to . Third largest home builder in volume but much more importantly Bill Pulte the grandson of the founder is also currently the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Need I say more • Lennar LEN second choice . Want to say this is the second largest homebuilder could be confusing this though . More importantly Stuart Miller CEO was part of Trump ’ s strategic and policy forum in the first admin . Also he hinted at talking to Trump admin late 2025 early this year about affordabilitysupply in meetings that included other home builders . • D.R Horton DHI A high volume home builder this company is actually the highest volume builder in the states . But I couldn ’ t find links to the admin here . Any other thoughts Thinking of opening a position into lennar or pulte next wk . Edit • Beacon Roofing Supply QXO JBSwerve mentioned QXO which sells sideboards windows and roofing main product . Kushner on the board"

      "selftext": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of micron's memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful. The stock was around 80$. So I picked it up. Sold it after some 20% gains. Did it twice or 3 times. However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not profitable. I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20% gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the (10% annual gain is good) rule. However in the crazy AI era, the bubble vs not bubble is not like any other. The conservative investor should not follow the trends. In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure. However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio. It should be away from tech. As I do not believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices. Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers' stocks. The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron. However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not be justified as there is no race anymore. I think of AI like the space race between superpowers. The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not equal or at least would not be growing (i.e. the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20% or 50% but very small probability that I do not care of). I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000$ from a weighted average of 2000$ scattered on 2.5 years. I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years. I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400$ sold it for 600$ then bought 800$ and sold 1000$. I can not stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else. Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains. So I'll start following the 80% 20% rule, 20 for the trading, 80 for long term investing. What good industries that set for continued growth in next 5-10 years, not financial institutions or consumer like Walmart. I aim for products or services that will improve people lives. I'll then start to look for some innovative companies either in its service/product or its way of doing them in better financial way. This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for people's advice here.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of microns memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful . The stock was around 80 $ . So I picked it up . Sold it after some 20 % gains . Did it twice or 3 times . However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not_profitable . I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20 % gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the 10 % annual gain is good rule . However in the crazy AI era the bubble vs not_bubble is not_like any other . The conservative investor should not_follow the trends . In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure . However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio . It should be away from tech . As I do not_believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices . Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers stocks . The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron . However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not_be justified as there is no_race anymore . I think of AI like the space race between superpowers . The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not_equal or at least would not_be growing i.e . the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20 % or 50 % but very small probability that I do not_care of . I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000 $ from a weighted average of 2000 $ scattered on 2.5 years . I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not_good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years . I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400 $ sold it for 600 $ then bought 800 $ and sold 1000 $ . I can not_stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else . Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains . So Ill start following the 80 % 20 % rule 20 for the trading 80 for long term investing . What good industries that set for continued growth in next 510 years not_financial institutions or consumer like Walmart . I aim for products or services that will improve people lives . Ill then start to look for some innovative companies either in its serviceproduct or its way of doing them in better financial way . This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for peoples advice here ."

      "selftext": "2025 had low transaction volume for home sales, the lowest turnover rate in decades, and the lowest rate of first time buyers EVER. With that being said I’m trying to land on a few housing adjacent plays to buy into in the next few years. I had looked into companies like Wayfair, Stanley decker, shark ninja, RH, and whirlpool (basically any companies that potentially stand to benefit from more people buying homes). One issue I have with Wayfair is it’s priced VERY high right now with a run up of $155% in the past year. Similarly shark ninja is a little bit pricey but undoubtedly has a solid and efficient business plan. Any companies you would recommend diving deeper into? Fully expect that it’ll be a few years before sales volumes really pick up again, but would rather start thinking through which tickers are positioned to make the most out of home sales increasing from all time lows. For reference you’ll see most of the stocks mentioned above had ATHs in 2020-2021; I don’t expect we’d see a buying season like that in at least the next ten years, BUT given a ton of these stocks tanked around low home sales and tariffs there is a run up they’d benefit from.",

      "selftext": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $2.5. There was a -$82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners, likely from ticker collision between $VLN and $VLN Toronto. Because of this, algorithms modeled this company to have <1Y runway after spending $82 Million while in reality they still have $93M cash and $11m in inventory. Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday. Yet algorithms have not caught on yet, as they're still modeling negative EV from -$82M burn (this requires manual correction). Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to -$82M error on Stonegate, Streetwise, and scanners. $VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $255M market cap size. This is not due to company quality and it's definitely not some random micro stock. But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in <1Y runway from $82m burn. This is a extremely mispriced AI & Robotics fabless chipmaker with: \\- Mercedes \\- Samsung \\- Mobileye (EyeQ6) \\- Siemens \\- Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers. $VLN has \\- Zero Debt. \\- $93.5 Million Cash \\- $11 Million + in inventory. \\- \\~$80M+ est. forward revenue \\- 69.1% gross margins on their robotics/machine vision/industrial vertical (growing 40% Y/Y). Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0%. If you want to compare similar companies: \\- Lattice $LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EV/Revenue. \\- Macom $MTSI, trades around 13x and 16.5x. EV/Revenue. Valens trades at: 2.4x. Which looks like a glitch. Even non-premium, 20-30% gross margin, companies trade at 4-5x (more than double current prices). We now see an extreme mispricing of a $NVDA-margin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors. Even trading at a normal 10x EV/revenue (no premium) would be $893.5M/106.34M= \\-> $8.40 from $2.5. This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision.",

      "title": "NEGG free float drops to 20k after insider buys and consumer PC component availability becoming scarcer",
      "selftext": "Hey I will try to keep this brief, as of last week, a private investor(a) have bought up almost of the free float of NEGG. There are now about 20k shares of the float not held by insiders. Retail long has at least a few hundred thousand. And the currently reported short count (fintel) is about 270k. It could well be more of we factor in the institutional holds. The company has previously been off the boil, but has cleared debt, has been looking to expand and is developing AR PC gaming experiences. Oh and PC components have gone up faster than any other 'asset' due to the whole data center thing leading to market scarcity. RAM up 600% for example. Financials for NEGG are annually reported and are not due until March, but a turnaround to profitability is expected. Given the over subscription of the float, and outstanding short positions, things could get very interesting. Things may happen sooner than the business case evidence. But business turn around and timing is another factor that sets a positive outlook. If you haven't looked into it and you are interested in market anomalies, I think you may struggle to find tickers with a higher % of insider holds. Of course I am in NEGG and have been since September 25, but I feel like this latest 13D and tiny free float needs to be communicated to those that don't know. Happy to field any questions.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey I will try to keep this brief as of last week a private investora have bought up almost of the free float of NEGG . There are now about 20k shares of the float not_held by insiders . Retail long has at least a few hundred thousand . And the currently reported short count fintel is about 270k . It could well be more of we factor in the institutional holds . The company has previously been off the boil but has cleared debt has been looking to expand and is developing AR PC gaming experiences . Oh and PC components have gone up faster than any other asset due to the whole data center thing leading to market scarcity . RAM up 600 % for example . Financials for NEGG are annually reported and are not_due until March but a turnaround to profitability is expected . Given the over subscription of the float and outstanding short positions things could get very interesting . Things may happen sooner than the business case evidence . But business turn around and timing is another factor that sets a positive outlook . If you havent looked into it and you are interested in market anomalies I think you may struggle to find tickers with a higher % of insider holds . Of course I am in NEGG and have been since September 25 but I feel like this latest 13D and tiny free float needs to be communicated to those that dont know . Happy to field any questions ."

      "selftext": "I’ve recently entered the market \\[32M\\] with €10,000 seed and a known budget of €1-2000 per month to invest in these 5 ETFs that have accumulating dividends, the plan is to set this fund up to retire at the age of \\~55 with a portfolio that I can withdraw 4% from per year to live an easy life. The plan is the below allocations using €1000 a month investment. ETF Name and monthly investment: Vanguard FTSE All-World High Dividend UCITS ETF - €350 VanEck Semiconductor UCITS ETF - €250 iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF - €150 iShares Automation & Robotics UCITS ETF - €150 VanEck Defense ETF A USD - €100 Around year 14, invested €168,000: • Portfolio value ≈ €340–360k • 8.6% return ≈ €29-31k • Returns > €12k contributions • Growth now does more work than you Year 25 If you stick with the plan, invested €300,000: • Portfolio value ≈ €1.5-1.7million • 5% return ≈ €75-82k • Returns \\~ € 6,650 per month • dividends far exceed €12k contributions per annum This with the accumulating dividends should provide a portfolio value of €1.63million with €300,000 invested after 25 years. Ideally I’m going to push more than €1000 per month but I need to be considerate that life gets in the way. Finally some generic investing mantra: One Rule for Success. Invest every month. Do not stop during market crashes. Do not change the plan. Time + consistency matter more than market timing. @reddit set reminder for this post in 25 years. See you all there my fellow millionaires.",

      "selftext": "Over the past couple of years, I started learning about investment and securities. Before then, I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never be able to understand. However, the deeper I go, the more angry and disillusioned I feel. What started as “invest in a company you believe in and grow with it” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement, no matter the method, no matter the ethics. It’s no longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow, it’s about speed, leverage, arbitrage, and squeezing edge out of anything that moves. Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself. Not from creating value. Not from improving products. Just from being faster, more aggressive, more optimised than the next guy. And it’s not just traditional markets. Look at crypto. In theory it was meant to democratise finance. In practice it’s become a playground for: - Rug pulls - Pump-and-dumps - Influencer scams - Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not to build, but to extract. The goal isn’t “grow something useful.” It’s “how do I get mine before everyone else does?” What bothers me most isn’t that some people are greedy, that’s human. It’s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage. If you hesitate, someone else front-runs you. If you care, someone else exploits the gap. At some point, it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose. I know markets are necessary. Capital has to flow. Risk has to be priced. But it feels like we’ve built a hyper-financialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it. And it leaves you wondering: Is this really what “investing” is supposed to be?",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past couple of years I started learning about investment and securities . Before then I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never_be able to understand . However the deeper I go the more angry and disillusioned I feel . What started as “ invest in a company you believe in and grow with it ” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement no_matter the method no_matter the ethics . It ’ s no_longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow it ’ s about speed leverage arbitrage and squeezing edge out of anything that moves . Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself . Not_from creating value . Not_from improving products . Just from being faster more aggressive more optimised than the next guy . And it ’ s not_just traditional markets . Look at crypto . In theory it was meant to democratise finance . In practice it ’ s become a playground for Rug pulls Pumpanddumps Influencer scams Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not_to build but to extract . The goal isn ’ t “ grow something useful. ” It ’ s “ how do I get mine before everyone else does ” What bothers me most isn ’ t that some people are greedy that ’ s human . It ’ s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage . If you hesitate someone else frontruns you . If you care someone else exploits the gap . At some point it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose . I know markets are necessary . Capital has to flow . Risk has to be priced . But it feels like we ’ ve built a hyperfinancialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it . And it leaves you wondering Is this really what “ investing ” is supposed to be"

I wonder how such a move would impact Visa and Mastercard as stocks. At the same time, I’m questioning the premise itself, credit card interest rates are set by issuing banks, not by Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks rather than lending businesses. If a rate cap were actually implemented, the direct financial impact would likely fall on banks rather than on Visa or Mastercard. Still, markets often react to headlines before nuance, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see short-term selling pressure on Visa and Mastercard driven by misunderstanding rather than fundamentals.",

I mean I like the platform, why wouldn't I like the stock? Its just like robinhood right (turns out no) AND I am whats called on there a \"popular investor\" which basically means all the noobs who \"know they should invest in something but don't know how to start\" can just \"copy\" me, and they execute all the same trades as me. I have hundreds of people who copy my trades, so I have no idea how much money I have lost people. One of my copiers was clearly a family investing their joint money, they closed their copy down 25% in total after copying me for like 6 months. So while all of you can claim to be dipshits, I'm the dipshit losing both mine AND strangers money.",

At this point I cant justify buying more but ... part of me wants to I dont know why I keep shooting myself in the dick but fuck it its only a loss when I sell or something pithy like that right To make it even better Im trading this on Etoro itself . I mean I like the platform why wouldnt I like the stock Its just like robinhood right turns out no_AND I am whats called on there a popular investor which basically means all the noobs who know they should invest in something but dont know how to start can just copy me and they execute all the same trades as me . I have hundreds of people who copy my trades so I have no_idea how much money I have lost people . One of my copiers was clearly a family investing their joint money they closed their copy down 25 % in total after copying me for like 6 months . So while all of you can claim to be dipshits Im the dipshit losing both mine AND strangers money ."

Currently, I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR (around 60k USD in total), I'm moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify, I'm worried about how heavy nvidia is, about USA current geopolitical actions, also I don't really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs. this is what I'm thinking I ***MIGHT*** need some parts of it in a few months if not I'm moving them to SPYL.L because I don't see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world, so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world.

I already got rejected from the research track and I’m waiting until April for the applied track results, but I’m worried I’m \"too old\" at 30 compared to the 20-year-olds with no experience they seem to prefer. The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold, and I’m still salty after losing 70% (due to currency devaluation) of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa. Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating, but I’m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k (around 18k USD, so 30% of my holdings at current prices) if I finally get the green light.",

Weight Ticker Name of Fund Accumulating Expense Ratio Domicile 50 % SPYL.L SPDR SP 500 UCITS ETF Yes 0.03 % USD Ireland 15 % IXUA.DE iShares MSCI World exUSA UCITS ETF Yes 0.15 % EUR Ireland 15 % EIMI.L iShares Core MSCI EM IMI UCITS ETF Yes 0.18 % USD Ireland 10 % IGLN.L iShares Physical Gold ETC Yes Physical 0.12 % USD Ireland 10 % TBills US Treasury Bills CashShortterm NA 0.00 % USA edit for more context I ’ ve had over $ 20k sitting in cash at IBKR since May for a potential Master ’ s in Europe need €15k for the visa School starts Late 2026 . I already got rejected from the research track and I ’ m waiting until April for the applied track results but I ’ m worried I ’ m too old at 30 compared to the 20yearolds with no_experience they seem to prefer . The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa . Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating but I ’ m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k around 18k USD so 30 % of my holdings at current prices if I finally get the green light ."

Tech focus: Exposure isn’t just traditional defence primes, but also AI, cyber, drones, space, and autonomous systems. Diversification: Holdings across US, Europe, and allies (e.g. Lockheed, RTX, BAE, Palantir, Thales, Saab). Policy tailwinds: Multi-year government contracts + long procurement cycles = revenue visibility. UCITS / unleveraged: Suitable for long-term holding, unlike single-stock or leveraged ETFs. Not risk-free, but as a thematic allocation to defence tech, ARMG looks well positioned for the next decade rather than just a short-term trade.",

      "title": "Crypto DATs are literally legal ponzi machine (BMNR / SBET / MSTR)",
      "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, I'm not against any digital asset treasuries (DATs), it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and it's legal. (Disclosure: I even have some position in some DATs) The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago, I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 2\\~3 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock, and I dismissed it as one of the \"stupid things in crypto\". But two weeks ago, I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20% discount on NAV, that piqued my interest, because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me, so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs, and if the opportunity is real or a trap. After some studying, and cut through all the bullshit terminology, I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is. # What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase, it'll probably be \"market irrationality harvester\", \"idiot harvesting machine\" or \"wealth transfer machine\" (transfer from idiot ofc). These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy, looks like a fund, but does not follow funds regulation or structure, a fund that has less transparency requirement, less protection for their shareholders (that's the point, it has to harvest the idiots). What the entire management do is very simple, they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean, ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock. The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type: * People who buy when the stock is below NAV (not necessarily mean they'll profit, more on this later.) * People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV (not necessarily mean they will lose money too! but **majority of them DO lose money**, they are the target to be harvested, or to be transfer wealth from.) Let's start with the simple one, why people who buy above the NAV will not necessarily lose money? Here's the ponzi part kicks in, because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV. To be fair though, many who bought above NAV knew this, just like in Ponzi, many know what they are getting into, but they just think they'll not be the last one holding the bag. (aka \"there'll be a greater fool\") Then there's people who buy the stock below NAV, these are usually people that'll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward, usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV, but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales, more on it next. # Accretive & Dilutive of DATs. Let me use a simple example, there's a stock with 1 million outstanding share, the entire value of the company is $1mil, so the NAV is exactly $1. In this example we'll assume the underlying asset value has no change and stay constant. Next, the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing, the stock price is now trading at $2 but the NAV stay unchanged, so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $2, raised $2mil and bought $2mil of underlying asset. Now there's 2 million outstanding shares, with $3mil underlying asset, the NAV of each share now becomes $1.5, this is **accretive**. Then some bad news happen, the stock price crashing from $2 to $1.5, then someone bought at $1.5, then it continue to crash to $1. At this point, the NAV is still $1.5, but the price of the stock is $1. For buyer at 3 difference price point * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.5 so they are fine for now. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, but they also know the NAV of the stock is $1.5 so they think they'll be fine. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, they figured out the NAV is $1.5 still below their entry price, they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock, to the same premium level for them to get out. Now for some reason, the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV, so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $1 price, raised another $1mil and bought the asset. Now there's 3 million outstanding share with $4mil underlying asset, the NAV becomes $1.33, falls from the previous $1.5 and this is **dilutive**. When this happen, all existing shareholders are equally harmed: * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.33, falling from previous $1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive, the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $1.33 they are still in lost, they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, the chance of them breakeven further decreases, as they require and even higher premium, and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point. So in conclusion, when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV, people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested. When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV, which happened before, and will likely happen again, all shareholders lose value in their share, the damage depends on what discount/premium level they got it. # Interest of the management is not aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part, unlike most of the Asset-based ETFs, there's a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premium/discount to keep the price close to the NAV, there's none for such DATs, and they are even worse than close end funds, because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market. The best part is, the management of these DATs doesn't necessarily care about the NAV per share, in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company, regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted. # So is there opportunity? Personally I think it's fine to make some risk calculated bet, especially when there's a deep discount on NAV, but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny, with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when it's dilutive. Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me, it amaze me because I never thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not create any production value at all, and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV, and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders, or the management itself. I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants, the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value, then stock like this should be banned, fined, or force to follow strict fund regulations. But anyway, I am not writing this because I care, I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the \"highly regulated\" stock market.",

      "selftext_processed": "Dont get me wrong Im not_against any digital asset treasuries DATs it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and its legal . Disclosure I even have some position in some DATs The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 23 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock and I dismissed it as one of the stupid things in crypto . But two weeks ago I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20 % discount on NAV that piqued my interest because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs and if the opportunity is real or a trap . After some studying and cut through all the bullshit terminology I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is . What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase itll probably be market irrationality harvester idiot harvesting machine or wealth transfer machine transfer from idiot ofc . These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy looks like a fund but does not_follow funds regulation or structure a fund that has less transparency requirement less protection for their shareholders thats the point it has to harvest the idiots . What the entire management do is very simple they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock . The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type People who buy when the stock is below NAV not necessarily mean theyll profit more on this later . People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV not necessarily mean they will lose money too but majority of them DO lose money they are the target to be harvested or to be transfer wealth from . Lets start with the simple one why people who buy above the NAV will not_necessarily lose money Heres the ponzi part kicks in because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV . To be fair though many who bought above NAV knew this just like in Ponzi many know what they are getting into but they just think theyll not_be the last one holding the bag . aka therell be a greater fool Then theres people who buy the stock below NAV these are usually people thatll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales more on it next . Accretive Dilutive of DATs . Let me use a simple example theres a stock with 1 million outstanding share the entire value of the company is $ 1mil so the NAV is exactly $ 1 . In this example well assume the underlying asset value has no_change and stay constant . Next the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing the stock price is now trading at $ 2 but the NAV stay unchanged so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $ 2 raised $ 2mil and bought $ 2mil of underlying asset . Now theres 2 million outstanding shares with $ 3mil underlying asset the NAV of each share now becomes $ 1.5 this is accretive . Then some bad news happen the stock price crashing from $ 2 to $ 1.5 then someone bought at $ 1.5 then it continue to crash to $ 1 . At this point the NAV is still $ 1.5 but the price of the stock is $ 1 . For buyer at 3 difference price point People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.5 so they are fine for now . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them but they also know the NAV of the stock is $ 1.5 so they think theyll be fine . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment they figured out the NAV is $ 1.5 still below their entry price they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock to the same premium level for them to get out . Now for some reason the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $ 1 price raised another $ 1mil and bought the asset . Now theres 3 million outstanding share with $ 4mil underlying asset the NAV becomes $ 1.33 falls from the previous $ 1.5 and this is dilutive . When this happen all existing shareholders are equally harmed People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.33 falling from previous $ 1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $ 1.33 they are still in lost they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment the chance of them breakeven further decreases as they require and even higher premium and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $ 1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point . So in conclusion when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested . When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV which happened before and will likely happen again all shareholders lose value in their share the damage depends on what discountpremium level they got it . Interest of the management is not_aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part unlike most of the Assetbased ETFs theres a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premiumdiscount to keep the price close to the NAV theres none for such DATs and they are even worse than close end funds because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market . The best part is the management of these DATs doesnt necessarily care about the NAV per share in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted . So is there opportunity Personally I think its fine to make some risk calculated bet especially when theres a deep discount on NAV but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when its dilutive . Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me it amaze me because I never_thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not_create any production value at all and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders or the management itself . I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value then stock like this should be banned fined or force to follow strict fund regulations . But anyway I am not_writing this because I care I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the highly regulated stock market ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week, and they printed. This morning I bought $CDE 1/23 $22 calls, and will be buying some longer-term calls next week. CDE made explosive moves today, crushing resistance. I can easily see this hitting $23 within the next couple of weeks, especially if silver holds strong. Here is a DD on the company: Coeur Mining (CDE) closed the day at $20.5, according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week and they printed . This morning I bought $ CDE 123 $ 22 calls and will be buying some longerterm calls next week . CDE made explosive moves today crushing resistance . I can easily see this hitting $ 23 within the next couple of weeks especially if silver holds strong . Here is a DD on the company Coeur Mining CDE closed the day at $ 20.5 according to VectorVest they are valued at 32.5 share . Therefore they are extremely undervalued . Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026 They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD a Canadian mining company . Once this merger goes through they will have 7 operations across North America . They will have the production capability of 900000oz of gold and 20000000oz of silver . They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit . They have had production expansion like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas . Therefore they are still growing . They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year . I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026 . Their debt is mostly longterm and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt . The coupon is fixed . I could not_find the allin sustaining cost but it cost them $ 248m to sell $ 554.6m worth of gold and silver . All their mines are considered to be in safe areas they have 3 in the US 2 in Mexico and 1 explorational site in BC . After the merger they will acquire more sites in Canada . So none of the mines will be politically impacted . They have no_active offering as a matter of fact they have a $ 75 million share buyback program valid through May 31 2026 . Their free cash flow is positive at $ 188M ."

      "selftext": "> President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent, in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail. “Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be ‘ripped off’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent,” Trump said in a social media post. > He said there would be a one-year cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20. It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House. > The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that the administration has suggested should not exist and has slashed funding for. Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday. The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November, according to Federal Reserve data, up from 12.9 percent in late 2013.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail . “ Please be informed that we will no_longer let the American Public be ‘ ripped off ’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent ” Trump said in a social media post . He said there would be a oneyear cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20 . It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress . Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders IVt . and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley RMo . would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years . Similar legislation has been introduced in the House . The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau an agency that the administration has suggested should not_exist and has slashed funding for . Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday . The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November according to Federal Reserve data up from 12.9 percent in late 2013 ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I am 22 years old and have been wanting to start investing for more than a year now. I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

I have spent all this time researching it and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026 until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it . So I am posting to ask for opinions to make sure I am thinking the right way or to highlight any wrongdoings . I live in Europe my currency is the euro . I have about €20k in savings and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing Im on the last year of university dont have a job and still live with my parents altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university . The goal is to invest for 3040 years . I read a lot about an all world ETF but i just dont think i want to do it . I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market rather than sicking with just one and having no_idea why it goes up or down if that makes sense . My plan was to do 60 % SP500 30 % Stoxx 600 and 10 % Emerging Markets . It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe . But now i just feel like im replicating all world ETF and started to think i should just buy that even though i dont want to for the reasons i stated before . Is my plan good Should i add or remove anything Change the percenteges Im just looking for some guidance andor reassurance . Thanks to everyone in advance"

      "selftext": "Meta Platforms announced a major deal to support Oklo and TerraPower, providing power for their AI data centers. We’re talking about a 1.2 GW nuclear park in Ohio. OKLO gapped up at the open, rising nearly 15% to 20% pre-market, though it pulled back during the session. As someone who successfully locked in profits pre-market today, seeing this gap up is bittersweet, but it perfectly validates the 'AI + Nuclear' investment thesis. Meta is actually providing upfront funding and prepaying for power. This transforms OKLO from a 'concept stock' into a real project with a major anchor customer and a clear 2030 roadmap. We’re seeing the whole sector rally, with Vistra (VST) up over 13% on the news. While I’m tempted to jump back in, I won’t chase a 20% gap up. I’m watching for a 'gap fill' move or consolidation around the $105 support level. RSI is definitely showing 'overbought' in the short term, but long-term institutional interest has surged. Anyone else catch this move? Are you holding for triple digits to become the new floor, or taking profits on this Meta-fueled hype?",

Here they are, from the lesser amount I need to put in to complete what I have, to the biggest: UEC: average of 6.50, 14+ last time I checked few days ago, with an ATH at 16 RYCEY: average of 8.50, now at 17+, that thing never goes down Lundin Mining: average of 12.50, now at 31+, same thing, completely booming.

      "selftext": "Vanguard's VOO seems to be the default ETF 'hold' and with good reason: it's performance has been exceptionally solid. But, when you look at Blackrock's Australian-founded, internationally-invested ETF IWLD, its upside in every respect seems to be far superior (except for management fees, which are more than offset by total cumulative returns. IWLD has generally tracked VOO very closely. Here are the differences: * Over 5 years, IWLD has, excluding dividends, returned 12.8% (higher), while VOO has returned \\~12.6% (lower) * Over 5 years, IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20% - 1.21% (higher), while VOO has paid 1.10% - 1.20% (lower) * IWLD is ESG screened, so it cuts out the most harmful stocks, while VOO has no screening other than the S&P (it hold's Chevron (fossil fuels) Phillip Morris (tobacco) etc. * VOO's fees are lower (0.03) vs IWLD's (0.2) * IWLD is more diversified, with more mid-sized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US, while VOO is very US, large-cap and tech-stock-heavy * IWLD is less US currency exposed, whereas IWLD (being internationally invested and Australian-based) has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very, very unstable When you look at the two ETFs, IWLD has grown more, returns more in dividends, costs more in fees, is more sustainable, is more diversified and is less currency exposed. On almost every metric, and in aggregate, it is a better fund. Why don't we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets?",

      "selftext": "ASML is arguably one of the most important companies in the world, with little to no competition, producing the machines required to produce the chips for companies such TSMC, Apple, etc. The main bear case a few years ago could’ve been reaching a wall after the development of their High-NA EUV manufacturing technique, but they are actively in development of Hyper-NA which is supposed to be able to create sub 1nm chip designs. You have to think that Moore’s law can only go so far and that they eventually will reach a limit to what their lithography machines can do, but at least in the near future I don’t see this company going anywhere, and they are so dominant that I don’t think another company is going to suddenly take up any of their market share. Even if they face some issues over the years, all major chip companies need them to keep making new manufacturing techniques so they can make better chips and can aid them. These companies certainly are going to want to keep refining their chips as demand has only gone up. A lot of the materials they use aren’t in short supply either such as tin and tungsten. Curious as to any opinions on why this wouldn’t be a good pick in the near-long run",

The main bear case a few years ago could ’ ve been reaching a wall after the development of their HighNA EUV manufacturing technique but they are actively in development of HyperNA which is supposed to be able to create sub 1nm chip designs . You have to think that Moore ’ s law can only go so far and that they eventually will reach a limit to what their lithography machines can do but at least in the near future I don ’ t see this company going anywhere and they are so dominant that I don ’ t think another company is going to suddenly take up any of their market share . Even if they face some issues over the years all major chip companies need them to keep making new manufacturing techniques so they can make better chips and can aid them . These companies certainly are going to want to keep refining their chips as demand has only gone up . A lot of the materials they use aren ’ t in short supply either such as tin and tungsten . Curious as to any opinions on why this wouldn ’ t be a good pick in the nearlong run"

Comparable to setting up automated investment plan through brokerage - specify amount, frequency, asset allocation. Key advantages: 1) Lower transaction costs (especially on Solana) 2) Immediate custody (no exchange risk) 3) Consolidated transaction history 4) Cross-chain portfolio visibility Tax considerations: Every crypto transaction generates tax obligation. Using single platform for automated purchases simplifies cost basis tracking versus manual purchases across multiple exchanges. Results after 6 months: Portfolio behaving as expected - high volatility, but systematic approach prevents emotional decision-making during drawdowns.

The S&P500 or any of the large equity ETF'S (QQQ, VTI, etc...) are pretty much the best bet for long term investing and will almost certainly go up over time. 2. Gold is in a short term bubble and is not a sound long term investment. Gold will almost certainly go down over time. Where do you guys fall on these opinions? Why? Thanks so much for your thoughts!",

The SP500 or any of the large equity ETFS QQQ VTI etc ... are pretty much the best bet for long term investing and will almost certainly go up over time . 2 . Gold is in a short term bubble and is not_a sound long term investment . Gold will almost certainly go down over time . Where do you guys fall on these opinions Why Thanks so much for your thoughts"

First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

      "selftext": "Nvidia capped a historic 2025 by becoming the world’s most valuable company, riding explosive demand for AI chips. CEO Jensen Huang is now pushing beyond data center AI into physical world applications like autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and AI powered assistants, aiming to embed Nvidia’s hardware and software at every layer of the next AI wave. With record revenue ($57B in a single quarter), a $500B+ order backlog through 2026, with indications from Jensen Huang that this number may actually have increased further resulting from developments since it was first announced, deep partnerships (OpenAI, Mercedes-Benz, Siemens), and new chips like Vera Rubin in full production, Nvidia is positioning itself to sustain dominance even amid what many believe are overblown bubble concerns. Key risks remain geopolitical, especially China export controls although the recent developments there appear positive. Nvidia’s strategy is a deliberate shift from being the AI infrastructure supplier, which they still dominate, to becoming a de facto platform owner for machine intelligence. By tying chips, software, simulation tools, and industry partnerships together, Nvidia is reducing customer optionality. Once a carmaker, factory, or robot fleet standardizes on Nvidia’s stack, switching costs rise sharply. This makes Nvidia less exposed to an eventual slowdown in AI model training spend and more leveraged to long duration, recurring demand from autonomous systems and industrial deployment. In effect, Nvidia is anchoring itself to physical capital cycles (cars, factories, robots), which evolve more slowly but are harder to displace once embedded which should help reduce eventual true downward pressure when an AI bubble in fact makes an appearance.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia capped a historic 2025 by becoming the world ’ s most valuable company riding explosive demand for AI chips . CEO Jensen Huang is now pushing beyond data center AI into physical world applications like autonomous vehicles robotics industrial automation and AI powered assistants aiming to embed Nvidia ’ s hardware and software at every layer of the next AI wave . With record revenue $ 57B in a single quarter a $ 500B order backlog through 2026 with indications from Jensen Huang that this number may actually have increased further resulting from developments since it was first announced deep partnerships OpenAI MercedesBenz Siemens and new chips like Vera Rubin in full production Nvidia is positioning itself to sustain dominance even amid what many believe are overblown bubble concerns . Key risks remain geopolitical especially China export controls although the recent developments there appear positive . Nvidia ’ s strategy is a deliberate shift from being the AI infrastructure supplier which they still dominate to becoming a de facto platform owner for machine intelligence . By tying chips software simulation tools and industry partnerships together Nvidia is reducing customer optionality . Once a carmaker factory or robot fleet standardizes on Nvidia ’ s stack switching costs rise sharply . This makes Nvidia less exposed to an eventual slowdown in AI model training spend and more leveraged to long duration recurring demand from autonomous systems and industrial deployment . In effect Nvidia is anchoring itself to physical capital cycles cars factories robots which evolve more slowly but are harder to displace once embedded which should help reduce eventual true downward pressure when an AI bubble in fact makes an appearance ."

      "selftext": "I’m gonna be mostly talking about ride share companies/autonomous vehicles manufacturers (uber, Lyft,Waymo ect) I’ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market. With the rise of Waymo and Tesla’s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber, Lyft, and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gonna be in this market. I’m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be. Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere. I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse. The horse was the main way of transportation, everyone owned one. Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car. Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses. This is how car ownership will be. The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver. Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it’s going to be a huge benefit to everyone. We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day. If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides. There’s no point in owning a car. It saves way more than buying a 30k car, insurance and having the liability of owning a car. Now the question is who’s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation. The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end. Think of uber now, like Netflix In the 2010s. They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming. As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing. The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate. We already saw the hbo merger drama. That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion. Tesla, Waymo, uber, Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players. I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall. They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft, while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated. This could also play out the reverse direction (seems less likely) also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers. This will ultimately leave 4-10ish players dominating consumer logistics. The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate (more likely Waymo and Tesla) and wipes everyone else out. I think it’s already too competitive of a space for this to happen. As this story progress we will see companies that haven’t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said: Overall I’m bullish, on Waymo, Tesla, uber, maybe Lyft. I don’t see a great future for ford, GM ECT Thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m gon na be mostly talking about ride share companiesautonomous vehicles manufacturers uber LyftWaymo ect I ’ ll start by saying we are at an extremely interesting time to be in this market . With the rise of Waymo and Tesla ’ s autonomous vehicles there is a ton of pressure for companies like uber Lyft and traditional consumer vehicles manufacturers to figure out how they are gon na be in this market . I ’ m going to lay out how I think autonomous vehicles are going to operate and who the winners will be . Right now Waymo and Tesla seem pretty close to having fully autonomous vehicles that can go anywhere . I believe the future of consumer logistics is that owning a car will be like owning a horse . The horse was the main way of transportation everyone owned one . Then came the car and most people swapped their horse for a car . Some niche enthusiasts still keep horses . This is how car ownership will be . The reason this is possible is that we are eliminating the most expensive part of the ride with av the driver . Costs for rides are going to be so so so cheap in the future it ’ s going to be a huge benefit to everyone . We also get added price decrease because 1 car is getting far greater utility by being used in max capacity day in and day out then 1 person buying a car that they use 1 time a day . If you could spend 500 dollars a year and have unlimited rides . There ’ s no_point in owning a car . It saves way more than buying a 30k car insurance and having the liability of owning a car . Now the question is who ’ s going to win with this new model of consumer transportation . The theory I believe in is there will be multiple winners or players in the beginning that will lead to consolidation and a few big players in the end . Think of uber now like Netflix In the 2010s . They have majority market share of ride share like Netflix had majority share of streaming . As the old model for entertainment started to crumble more and more companies got their own streaming service and now we have 10 different streaming services all competing . The second phase of this is starting for streaming services where these streaming services are going to start to consolidate . We already saw the hbo merger drama . That is exactly how ride share is going to play out in my opinion . Tesla Waymo uber Lyft maybe more in the future are going to be the major players . I think traditional consumer car manufacturers like Ford and GM are going to be wiped from consumer facing and have a huge down fall . They will end up just providing cars for uber and Lyft and I think merge with uber and Lyft while Waymo and Tesla are already integrated . This could also play out the reverse direction seems less likely also could happen where Tesla and Waymo merge with uber and Lyft which would ultra fuck consumer vehicle manufacturers . This will ultimately leave 410ish players dominating consumer logistics . The other less likely IMO path is that one of those 4 just dominate more likely Waymo and Tesla and wipes everyone else out . I think it ’ s already too competitive of a space for this to happen . As this story progress we will see companies that haven ’ t been invented yet enter and put their spin on it all so with that being said Overall I ’ m bullish on Waymo Tesla uber maybe Lyft . I don ’ t see a great future for ford GM ECT Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hello all, Please take a look below at this plan and let me know your feedback. I appreciate you taking the time to time to read it. Context: I’m aiming to grow a $770,000 portfolio to $1,000,000 by Dec 31, 2026. I need a 29.8% total return. I’m balancing an advisor’s conservative S&P 500 anchor with my own high-conviction \"Alpha\" plays in the AI infrastructure and Nuclear sectors. Current Market Condition (Jan 9, 2026): Markets are at ATHs. S&P is testing 6,970. Geopolitical \"relief rallies\" are in full swing, but technicals look overextended. The plan: 1. The Allocation (The 50/50 Barbell) * Invested (50% - $385k): Strike-force deployment once the market hits a 1.5% pullback from today’s highs. * Cash Shield (50% - $385k): Held in SNSXX (3.42% yield) for dip-buying and risk mitigation. | Asset | Ticker | Weight | Amount | Strategy | |---|---|---|---|---| | S&P 500 | VOO | 40% | $154,000 | The Anchor (DRIP ON). | | Nasdaq 100 | QQQM | 20% | $77,000 | The Engine (DRIP ON). | | Nuclear/Uranium | NLR | 20% | $77,000 | The Power Bottleneck (DRIP OFF). | | Semiconductors | SMH | 10% | $38,500 | Sector-wide Speed (DRIP OFF). | | NVIDIA | NVDA | 5% | $19,250 | Pure GPU Alpha (DRIP OFF). | | Broadcom | AVGO | 5% | $19,250 | Custom Silicon Lead (DRIP OFF). | 2. The Rule Structure: * The Wait: No buying until VOO hits $629 or QQQM hits $254. I’m looking for 2 consecutive red days or a CPI-induced sell-off (Jan 15) to enter. * The Scalp (Aggressive): I have a $55k short-term capital loss carryover to use this year. At a 5% gain, I will harvest the profit into SNSXX. * The Runner Rule: For the satellites (NVDA, AVGO, NLR, SMH), I will replace Limit Orders with a 2% Trailing Stop once they hit +5% to capture potential parabolic moves. * The Dip Rule: I have 7 waves of $55,000 in cash. If any asset drops 5% from my strike price, I deploy one wave immediately. * The Phasing: If the market stays green, I deploy $55k into VOO/QQQM every 60 days (skipping April due to midterm election year historical soft patch). 3. Why this hits $1M in 2026 * $17.3k in risk-free SNSXX interest. * $55k in tax-neutralized scalps (thanks to the loss carryover). * $158k required from market growth. With NVDA Rubin cycle and Nuclear energy data center demand accelerating, this is the \"Physical AI\" play. Questions for the community: * Is a 2% Trailing Stop too tight for the 2026 \"vibration\" of chips? * Thoughts on skipping the April 1st phase in a midterm election year? * Am I holding too much cash ($385k) given the 29.8% return hurdle?",

      "selftext": "Mobileye to Acquire Mentee Robotics for $900M: Challenging Tesla for the Future of Labor By acquiring Mentee Robotics, Mobileye (MBLY) is positioning itself as a direct competitor to Tesla’s \"Optimus\" project. However, Mobileye is sticking to its \"Android for Cars\" philosophy selling its self-driving software and chips to other brands, **while building its own humanoid robots in-house**. Business Model: Unlike Tesla’s closed ecosystem, Mobileye will continue to provide an open platform (software/chips) for the automotive industry while developing the robot as a specialized internal product. The Technology: The robots use \"mentoring\" AI, meaning they learn tasks from a single human demonstration rather than needing massive amounts of pre-programmed data. The Two-Phase Roadmap Phase 1 (2026–2028): Industrial Labor. The first deployments will hit factories and fulfillment centers to address global labor shortages and handle repetitive physical tasks. Phase 2 (~2030): The Home. The long-term goal is a consumer-facing \"domestic helper\" capable of handling laundry, clearing tables, and providing elderly care.",

      "selftext": "First, I'm not a financial professional and this is not professional investment advice. I'm just looking broadly at the market and I'm a little concerned. Also, I'm not a VOO for lifer, but I don't hate that strategy. It seems to have worked very well in the past. \\--- The S&P 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe. The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62% of the weight, and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI. To make matters a little more concerning, several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt. Basically, I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued (especially Tesla with its ridiculous \\~300 p/e ratio) and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn. That's why I'm moving significant portions of my holdings to a **revenue-weighted** version of the S&P 500. I'm using Invesco's RWL, but there are many others that are basically the same. While their performances historically are damn near identical, revenue-weighted versions of the S&P 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower. For example, while the **top 10** of the normal S&P 500 make up nearly 40% of the fund, for RWL, the **top 24** make up around that much. Sure, it's going to be pretty similar in the long term, but in the short term, it looks like you're going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive. **Edit: I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically.** Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs, and this is no exception. The comparison is 0.03% for Vanguard and 0.39% for Invesco. While the fees are 13x higher, I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification. Because Vanguard's fee rate is so low, I personally haven't felt the difference yet, but **it is there and it is significant**. If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF, I would move to that one in a heartbeat. **Also, in the past, RWL hasn't performed better in down markets historically.** I think that an AI bubble burst would be different, however. RWL simply has less holdings in AI-forward stocks, meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower.",

      "selftext_processed": "First Im not_a financial professional and this is not_professional investment advice . Im just looking broadly at the market and Im a little concerned . Also Im not_a VOO for lifer but I dont hate that strategy . It seems to have worked very well in the past . The SP 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe . The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62 % of the weight and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI . To make matters a little more concerning several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt . Basically I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued especially Tesla with its ridiculous 300 pe ratio and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn . Thats why Im moving significant portions of my holdings to a revenueweighted version of the SP 500 . Im using Invescos RWL but there are many others that are basically the same . While their performances historically are damn near identical revenueweighted versions of the SP 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower . For example while the top 10 of the normal SP 500 make up nearly 40 % of the fund for RWL the top 24 make up around that much . Sure its going to be pretty similar in the long term but in the short term it looks like youre going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive . Edit I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically . Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs and this is no_exception . The comparison is 0.03 % for Vanguard and 0.39 % for Invesco . While the fees are 13x higher I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification . Because Vanguards fee rate is so low I personally havent felt the difference yet but it is there and it is significant . If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF I would move to that one in a heartbeat . Also in the past RWL hasnt performed better in down markets historically . I think that an AI bubble burst would be different however . RWL simply has less holdings in AIforward stocks meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower ."

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term. Holding 6455 shares at $129.99 this is not financial advice just my opinion",

      "selftext": "This is a big deal. For the first time in years, Google's parent company Alphabet has surpassed Apple in market cap, becoming the world's second most valuable company. Is this a temporary blip or the start of a major shift in the Mag7 power rankings? My take: This is a fundamental shift. Apple's problem is that its growth is slowing. The iPhone is a mature product. The Vision Pro is cool, but it's a niche product, not a mass-market game-changer. Their revenue growth is in the low single digits. It's becoming a value stock, not a growth stock. Google, on the other hand, is an AI powerhouse. Their cloud business is growing at 25%+, and they are monetizing AI across their entire ecosystem (Search, YouTube, Android). They have a clear path to double-digit growth for the next 5 years. The market is finally waking up to this. Here's how I see the new Mag7 hierarchy: 1. Microsoft: The undisputed king. Dominant in cloud (Azure) and enterprise AI. 2. Google: The new #2. The purest AI play with a massive moat. 3. Nvidia: The essential hardware provider. The 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush. 4. Amazon: Still a beast in e-commerce and cloud, but facing more competition. 5. Apple: The new 'old tech'. A cash-flow machine, but growth is a question mark. 6. Meta: The wild card. The metaverse is a huge bet. Could be #1 or #7 in 5 years. 7. Tesla: The most volatile. Depends entirely on FSD and robotics. I'm re-weighting my portfolio based on this. I'm trimming my Apple position and adding to Google and Microsoft. I believe the market will continue to reward real AI-driven growth. I have a full valuation model for all 7 of the Mag7 stocks, comparing their growth rates, margins, and P/E ratios. It's how I made this call. Am I crazy for selling Apple? What's your ranking of the Mag7 for the next 5 years?",

But looking at the data for 2026, I'm seeing something different: What's changing: • Emerging markets returned 34.4% in 2025 (outperforming US) • Energy stocks are rallying (JP Morgan estimates US oil potential) • Value stocks are starting to outperform growth • Housing prices are DOWN for the first time in 2+ years • Retail spending is showing signs of fatigue This feels like the beginning of a real market rotation, not just a dip What I'm realizing: The easy money in 2025 was in mega-cap tech. But 2026 might reward investors who are willing to diversify: • Energy (oil prices forecast to average $61/barrel) • Emerging markets (already up 34.4% in 2025) • Real estate (prices down, potentially a buying opportunity) • Retail (some names like ULTA, AEO, GAP are showing strength) I'm not saying sell everything. But I am saying that the playbook from 2025 (just buy Nvidia) might not work in 2026. Am I crazy for thinking this? Or are you seeing the same signs?",

      "selftext": "Bottom Line Up Front: Counterpart AI doesn’t replace doctors, it helps Medical Doctors, Registered Nurses, and pharmacists act earlier so patients stay home and hospitals stay emty. Disclaimer: This post was written with the assistance of ChatGPT for general discussion only and is not medical, financial, or professional advice. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ How Counterpart AI (Clover AI) is supposed to work. Example patient: 72-year-old with diabetes (DM) and heart failure (CHF) (Step 1): Risk identification The system reviews existing data like: • Medical records (EHR) • Medication history and refills • Prior ER or hospital visits Based on patterns, the patient is flagged as higher risk for a future hospitalization. (Step 2): In-visit prompt During a regular appointment, the doctor may see a short note such as: “Heart failure (CHF) risk trending upward consider labs, medication review, and adherence check.” Nothing replaces clinical judgment. It’s more of a reminder than an alert. (Step 3): Care team follow-up If needed: • The medical doctor adjusts medications • A registered nurse handles follow-ups • A registered pharmacist helps simplify meds or check adherence The idea is that everyone focuses on the same high-risk patients instead of spreading effort evenly. (Step 4): Prevention By catching issues earlier: • Some ER visits may be avoided • Fewer hospital admissions • Better continuity of care Lower costs are a side effect, not the main action. (Why) Why clinicians might actually use something like this • Less time digging through charts • Clearer prioritization of patients • Works within existing workflows In value-based care models, incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume. Big picture: When risk is identified earlier, care teams have a better chance to intervene sooner, potentially avoiding some hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes.",

Disclaimer This post was written with the assistance of ChatGPT for general discussion only and is not_medical financial or professional advice . _________________________________________________ How Counterpart AI Clover AI is supposed to work . Example patient 72yearold with diabetes DM and heart failure CHF Step 1 Risk identification The system reviews existing data like • Medical records EHR • Medication history and refills • Prior ER or hospital visits Based on patterns the patient is flagged as higher risk for a future hospitalization . Step 2 Invisit prompt During a regular appointment the doctor may see a short note such as “ Heart failure CHF risk trending upward consider labs medication review and adherence check. ” Nothing_replaces clinical judgment . It ’ s more of a reminder than an alert . Step 3 Care team followup If needed • The medical doctor adjusts medications • A registered nurse handles followups • A registered pharmacist helps simplify meds or check adherence The idea is that everyone focuses on the same highrisk patients instead of spreading effort evenly . Step 4 Prevention By catching issues earlier • Some ER visits may be avoided • Fewer hospital admissions • Better continuity of care Lower costs are a side effect not_the main action . Why Why clinicians might actually use something like this • Less time digging through charts • Clearer prioritization of patients • Works within existing workflows In valuebased care models incentives are often tied to outcomes rather than volume . Big picture When risk is identified earlier care teams have a better chance to intervene sooner potentially avoiding some hospital admissions and improving patient outcomes ."

      "title": "Private prisons' stocks tanked as Wall Street expected more ICE detentions last year",
      "selftext": "Here's some of [our report]( The GEO Group and CoreCivic, the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE, seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year’s inauguration of President Donald Trump. But while Trump’s deportation machine had explosive growth, its reach hasn’t lived up to Wall Street expectations. Stock prices for both companies slumped. Despite a series of immigration blitzes and high-profile raids, the government didn’t use as much detention space as investors expected. Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year, with the immigration system, and privately run holding facilities, expected to grow even larger. “Once Trump was elected, there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger,” said Joe Gomes, an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets, an investment bank. “It’s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up.” On his first day in office, Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention. Days later, the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law, the Laken Riley Act, made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of low-level crimes. At the beginning of 2025, contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty, ready to be reactivated. GEO Group seemed particularly well-suited. “This is a unique moment in our company’s history, and we believe we are well-positioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing, transportation, electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration, and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders,” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February. By summer, Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” was signed into law, approving $170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement. Oddly enough, the price of GEO Group’s stock, which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day, then plummeted. At the end of 2025, GEO Group’s stock was trading around $16 per share, down from a high of $36.46 on Trump’s second day in office. Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic, formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America. “Investors got over their skis,” said Gomes, the analyst. [Read more]( (no paywall or ads)",

      "selftext_processed": "Heres some of our report The GEO Group and CoreCivic the largest companies that provide detention space for ICE seemed likely to reap a windfall after their stocks soared in the weeks leading up to last year ’ s inauguration of President Donald Trump . But while Trump ’ s deportation machine had explosive growth its reach hasn ’ t lived up to Wall Street expectations . Stock prices for both companies slumped . Despite a series of immigration blitzes and highprofile raids the government didn ’ t use as much detention space as investors expected . Detention industry experts and other observers believe all that could change this year with the immigration system and privately run holding facilities expected to grow even larger . “ Once Trump was elected there was a rush and belief that all this was going to occur at the snap of a finger ” said Joe Gomes an equity analyst for Noble Capital Markets an investment bank . “ It ’ s just taken a little longer than many investors thought to see these numbers really jump up. ” On his first day in office Trump reversed an executive order from former President Joe Biden to curb the use of private companies to operate federal prisons for the Justice Department though they continued to be used for immigration detention . Days later the first piece of legislation Trump signed into law the Laken Riley Act made it easier to detain undocumented immigrants accused of lowlevel crimes . At the beginning of 2025 contractors had about a dozen prison facilities sitting empty ready to be reactivated . GEO Group seemed particularly wellsuited . “ This is a unique moment in our company ’ s history and we believe we are wellpositioned to scale up our diversified segments in secure housing transportation electronic monitoring to meet the changing needs of this new administration and to continue to enhance value for our shareholders ” GEO Group founder George Zoley said in February . By summer Trump ’ s “ One Big Beautiful Bill Act ” was signed into law approving $ 170 billion in new funding for immigration enforcement . Oddly enough the price of GEO Group ’ s stock which had nearly tripled between the waning months of the presidential campaign and Inauguration Day then plummeted . At the end of 2025 GEO Group ’ s stock was trading around $ 16 per share down from a high of $ 36.46 on Trump ’ s second day in office . Stock prices also fell for CoreCivic formerly known as Corrections Corporation of America . “ Investors got over their skis ” said Gomes the analyst . Read more no paywall or ads"

      "selftext": "The consensus forecast for 2026 is: GDP growth of 2.5-3%, continued Fed rate cuts, and a \"soft landing\" for the economy.But here's what I think the consensus is missing: Tariff Uncertainty: Trump's tariff policies are a wildcard. If tariffs escalate, inflation could re-caccelerate, forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts. This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama: The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026. If there's a standoff, it could create a mini-crisis. Markets hate uncertainty. Valuation Risk: The S&P 500 is trading at 205% above its long-term trend. That's a historic extreme. While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, mean reversion is a mathematical certainty. The question is when. Geopolitical Escalation: With Trump's aggressive foreign policy (Venezuela, Greenland, etc.), geopolitical risk is elevated. A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction. So, while the consensus is optimistic, I'm cautious. I'm positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025, with potential for a 10-15% correction at some point. What's your base case for 2026? Are you optimistic or cautious? Disclaimer: This is a macro outlook for discussion. If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me, DM me, I will be happy to discuss with everyone",

If tariffs escalate inflation could recaccelerate forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts . This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026 . If theres a standoff it could create a minicrisis . Markets hate uncertainty . Valuation Risk The SP 500 is trading at 205 % above its longterm trend . Thats a historic extreme . While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent mean reversion is a mathematical certainty . The question is when . Geopolitical Escalation With Trumps aggressive foreign policy Venezuela Greenland etc . geopolitical risk is elevated . A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction . So while the consensus is optimistic Im cautious . Im positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025 with potential for a 1015 % correction at some point . Whats your base case for 2026 Are you optimistic or cautious Disclaimer This is a macro outlook for discussion .

      "title": "Help me understand settlement, margin, etc.",
      "selftext": "Hello all. I'm trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online. Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info. I'm mostly an invest-and-forget kind of investor, but do play with options a little just for fun (options buy would typically be less than 0.1% of my total investments). For my options \"play\" I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade, which I've had for a couple of decades at least. In ETrade I could sell a position (stock or options) and immediately use that money to buy something else. I moved that account to Schwab (much more modern interface and some nice research tools), and found out I can't do that - I can't spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles. WTF? Is that really a common thing? I'm fairly certain I can sell/buy immediately in my Vanguard account too, but I don't trade actively enough to really say for sure - mostly mutual funds there, so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway. I just never realized, I guess. I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab, then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no interest (if it happens same-day). This was stated in a reddit comment by someone, but I can't find that info in any Schwab documents, so I'm not sure how much to trust it. I didn't set up margin on that account, because I don't want to actually borrow to invest, but maybe ETrade really worked through margin, and I just didn't know? A little more backstory, and I'm hoping I didn't make a rash move: I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation, as right now I've got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies. I'm stuck with two of those (employer-driven), one of which is Fidelity, and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity. ETrade keeps getting moved/bought, and doesn't keep their interface very up-to-date so it just feels old and clunky (and sometimes just doesn't work, although that seems to have been improving lately). Plus, simplifying by having fewer companies would be good. Unfortunately, Fidelity customer service really pissed me off, and they were utterly incompetent - I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved - online didn't work, talking to customer service didn't work, they put in a tech support ticket, and that didn't work, they sent me paper forms but then I'd need to find a place to print and sign... it was a mess. Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes, including the account transfer request, which settled in less than a week. Yay! No simplification for me, however (one company swapped out for another new one, albeit one with a nicer trading platform), and I probably didn't investigate carefully enough -- I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service, which is a bad reason to make a decision. Vanguard would have been easy, but if I move retirement accounts there (possible) I'd have 99% of my assets with one company, which I'm trying to avoid. And their trading platform is terrible. Ugh. It shouldn't be this complicated....",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello all . Im trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online . Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info . Im mostly an investandforget kind of investor but do play with options a little just for fun options buy would typically be less than 0.1 % of my total investments . For my options play I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade which Ive had for a couple of decades at least . In ETrade I could sell a position stock or options and immediately use that money to buy something else . I moved that account to Schwab much more modern interface and some nice research tools and found out I cant do that I cant spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles . WTF Is that really a common thing Im fairly certain I can sellbuy immediately in my Vanguard account too but I dont trade actively enough to really say for sure mostly mutual funds there so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway . I just never_realized I guess . I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no_interest if it happens sameday . This was stated in a reddit comment by someone but I cant find that info in any Schwab documents so Im not_sure how much to trust it . I didnt set up margin on that account because I dont want to actually borrow to invest but maybe ETrade really worked through margin and I just didnt know A little more backstory and Im hoping I didnt make a rash move I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation as right now Ive got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies . Im stuck with two of those employerdriven one of which is Fidelity and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity . ETrade keeps getting movedbought and doesnt keep their interface very uptodate so it just feels old and clunky and sometimes just doesnt work although that seems to have been improving lately . Plus simplifying by having fewer companies would be good . Unfortunately Fidelity customer service really pissed me off and they were utterly incompetent I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved online didnt work talking to customer service didnt work they put in a tech support ticket and that didnt work they sent me paper forms but then Id need to find a place to print and sign ... it was a mess . Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes including the account transfer request which settled in less than a week . Yay No_simplification for me however one company swapped out for another new one albeit one with a nicer trading platform and I probably didnt investigate carefully enough I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service which is a bad reason to make a decision . Vanguard would have been easy but if I move retirement accounts there possible Id have 99 % of my assets with one company which Im trying to avoid . And their trading platform is terrible . Ugh . It shouldnt be this complicated ...."

      "selftext": "I’m 22 years old and just transitioned from an internship to a full-time Software Engineer role making $85k a year in a low tax state. I currently have $12.3k in a brokerage account invested entirely in FXAIX, and I’ve been contributing $100 per week to that account. For my retirement strategy, I have set up my 401k with a 6% pre-tax contribution and a 3% Roth contribution, though I need to be with the company for a full year before they start their 50% match on the first 6%. My immediate goal is to max out my Roth IRA for the 2025 tax year before the April deadline and start on 2026 as well. I’m looking for advice on whether I should stay the course with the long-term index fund approach or if it makes sense to be more aggressive and \"play\" with a portion of my money given my age and career path. I’m also wondering if I should prioritize increasing my 401k contributions further or if I should focus entirely on the Roth IRA and tax advantaged accounts before putting more into my taxable brokerage. I’m open to any feedback and advice! Thanks in advance.",

I currently have $ 12.3k in a brokerage account invested entirely in FXAIX and I ’ ve been contributing $ 100 per week to that account . For my retirement strategy I have set up my 401k with a 6 % pretax contribution and a 3 % Roth contribution though I need to be with the company for a full year before they start their 50 % match on the first 6 % . My immediate goal is to max out my Roth IRA for the 2025 tax year before the April deadline and start on 2026 as well . I ’ m looking for advice on whether I should stay the course with the longterm index fund approach or if it makes sense to be more aggressive and play with a portion of my money given my age and career path . I ’ m also wondering if I should prioritize increasing my 401k contributions further or if I should focus entirely on the Roth IRA and tax advantaged accounts before putting more into my taxable brokerage . I ’ m open to any feedback and advice Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "I am a U.S. citizen living in Germany. This is nice for many reasons, but causes some real headaches for investment. Long story short, normal U.S. brokers won't let me buy ETFs etc. without a US address, and if I buy the same in Germany I will be double-taxed into oblivion. The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live, and disincentives for \"passive foreign income\" screw expats over. However, buying individual stocks and bonds is not \"passive\" and therefore avoids the double taxation problem. I understand this as a loser's game and would vastly prefer the buy-and-forget index fund approach, but that's not an option for me. So my questions: * Is it possible to \"simulate\" an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds? Or would this take a life-consuming amount of effort to do without massive risk? * Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bond-like accounts (Raisin etc.)? * Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken? **TLDR** I'm hoping to approximate as closely as I can the \"normal\" investing approach that a working person in the USA would take, but I have to do so without \"passive\" index funds.",

I know that if my trades looked like some of the really bad apples the SEC would be up my butt with a magnifying glass so big I wouldn’t even be able to walk for a week, they would execute search warrants on me and anyone who manages my investments, and I would almost definitively end up in jail. Why aren’t we doing anything? It’s completely unfair, as someone making a congressional salary, and privilege to serve which some people can only dream of, and to just use it to your advantage is a sign of pooooor ethics, morals, etc not what is expected of our representatives. I’m relatively poor, I wish they would let me do insider trading like congress does, wouldnt it be nice if we ALL had a get rich easy card.",

Why aren ’ t we doing anything It ’ s completely unfair as someone making a congressional salary and privilege to serve which some people can only dream of and to just use it to your advantage is a sign of pooooor ethics morals etc not_what is expected of our representatives . I ’ m relatively poor I wish they would let me do insider trading like congress does wouldnt it be nice if we ALL had a get rich easy card ."

My main motivation was exposure to consumer credit without being fully correlated with equity markets. What I learned pretty quickly is that P2P is not “passive income” in the true sense. You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes. On the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns.

      "selftext": "The \"Walled Garden\" just got bulldozed. After years of touting \"Apple Intelligence\" as the ultimate privacy play, Tim Cook is reportedly cutting a $1B+ check to let Google’s Gemini do the heavy lifting for Siri. This is a massive capitulation. Apple is effectively admitting they can't scale LLMs fast enough on-device and needs to lease the \"brain\" from their biggest rival. From a trade perspective: 1. Alphabet (GOOGL) now effectively owns the AI stack for the entire mobile world—Android AND iOS. That's a data moat nobody can touch. 2. Apple’s Services margins are going to take a hit if they’re paying a \"Gemini Tax\" for every complex Siri query. How are we playing this? GOOGL calls for the iPhone 17 cycle seem like free money at this point. Is Apple even a tech leader anymore, or just a luxury hardware wrapper for Google software?

      "selftext": "Source: [ WASHINGTON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms said on Friday it struck 20-year agreements to buy power from three Vistra nuclear plants in the U.S. heartland and ​develop projects with two companies hoping to build small modular reactors. Shares of Oklo surged nearly 20%, ‌whereas Vistra rose about 8% in premarket trade. Meta and other Big Tech companies want to secure long-term electricity supplies as [artificial ‌intelligence]( and data centers increase U.S. power demand for the first time in two decades. The company said in a blog it will purchase power from Vistra's Perry and Davis-Besse plants in Ohio and Beaver Valley plant in Pennsylvania. Meta said the deal will help finance expansion at the Ohio plants and lengthen the lifespan ⁠of the plants, which are licensed ‌to run through at least 2036 with one of two reactors at Beaver Valley licensed through 2047. Meta will also help develop small modular reactors planned by ‍Oklo and TerraPower, the latter of which is backed by billionaire Bill Gates. SMR backers say the reactors will one day save costs because they can be built in factories instead of on site. Critics say they will ​struggle to achieve economies of scale similar to current large reactors. There are no U.S. SMRs ‌in commercial operations yet and the plants will require permits. Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said the plans along with its agreement last year with Constellation to keep an Illinois reactor operating for 20 years will \"make Meta one of the most significant corporate purchasers of nuclear energy in American history.\" The agreements will provide up to 6.6 gigawatts of nuclear power by 2035, Meta said. The size ⁠of a typical nuclear power plant is about 1 ​GW. In 2024 Meta sought interest from nuclear power developers ​for 1 to 4 gigawatts of nuclear power. Meta will help fund TerraPower's development of two reactors to generate up to 690 megawatts of power as early as 2032. ‍The agreement also provides ⁠Meta with rights for energy from up to six other TerraPower reactors by 2035. TerraPower President and CEO Chris Levesque said the agreement will support rapid deployment of reactors. Meta said its ⁠partnership with Oklo will help develop up to 1.2 GW of energy in Ohio as early as 2030. The support ‌will help \"early procurement and development\", said Jacob DeWitte, Oklo’s co-founder and CEO.",

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

      "selftext": "As a yield strategist, I see a lot of investors obsess over dividend percentage or yield without really understanding where that yield is coming from. A high yield doesn’t automatically mean a high return. In many cases, it actually signals trouble, such as: • The stock price has fallen, making the yield look attractive only after the damage is done • Cash flows are cyclical or unsustainable • Dividends are being paid through debt rather than earnings Yield should be evaluated only after looking at: • Balance sheet strength • Durability and consistency of cash flows • Payout ratios across different economic cycles • Management’s discipline in capital allocation In many situations, a lower but sustainable yield combined with steady growth outperforms a flashy double-digit yield that gets cut in the next downturn. Yield is a result, not a strategy. Curious how others here assess dividend safety beyond just the headline yield.",

A high yield doesn ’ t automatically mean a high return . In many cases it actually signals trouble such as • The stock price has fallen making the yield look attractive only after the damage is done • Cash flows are cyclical or unsustainable • Dividends are being paid through debt rather than earnings Yield should be evaluated only after looking at • Balance sheet strength • Durability and consistency of cash flows • Payout ratios across different economic cycles • Management ’ s discipline in capital allocation In many situations a lower but sustainable yield combined with steady growth outperforms a flashy doubledigit yield that gets cut in the next downturn . Yield is a result not_a strategy . Curious how others here assess dividend safety beyond just the headline yield ."

      "selftext": "All eyes are on the US Supreme Court today for its ruling on US President Donald Trump’s tariffs against the trade partners of the country. The top court is expected to issue rulings on Friday, as it has scheduled January 9 as an “opinion day”- the first chance for a ruling on Trump tariffs. The court does not announce ahead of time which rulings it intends to issue. Media reports highlight that the US Supreme Court generally releases decisions around 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (ET) on opinion days. The US Supreme Court will now give its verdict on whether Trump can invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs without Congress's approval. Practical and economic implications : The stakes of the Supreme Court’s decision extend far beyond legal theory. The tariffs imposed under IEEPA have generated billions of dollars in revenue4 and have had a significant impact on global trade relationships. If the Court invalidates these tariffs, many companies will likely seek refunds, creating substantial administrative and financial challenges for the government. Moreover, the ruling could alter the dynamics of trade negotiations, as the threat of swift, sweeping tariffs has been a powerful tool in bringing other countries to the bargaining table. Notably, certain tariffs – such as those imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act 1962 and Section 301 of the Trade Act 1974 – would remain unaffected by the Court’s decision. These authorities provide alternative mechanisms for the administration to pursue its trade and national security objectives, albeit with more targeted and procedurally defined tools. The tariffs imposed last year amounted to an average tax increase of $1,100 per U.S. household last year and are seen at $1,400 this year, according to the Tax Foundation, a think tank. It estimated that those numbers would shrink to $300 in 2025 and $400 this year if the IEEPA tariffs go away. The court's decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trump's tariffs. It could, for example, narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit, Morgan Stanley's policy strategists wrote earlier this week. It could also give the administration a \"grace period\" to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place. And even if tariffs are fully scaled back, the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels. \"Among other variables, timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios,\" Morgan Stanley wrote.",

The courts decision may also land somewhere between full support or a complete rollback of Trumps tariffs . It could for example narrow the scope of the IEEPA tariffs to a few countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit Morgan Stanleys policy strategists wrote earlier this week . It could also give the administration a grace period to change the legal authorities underpinning those tariffs and put a time limit on those currently in place . And even if tariffs are fully scaled back the Trump administration has alternative powers to replace or reimpose current tariff levels . Among other variables timing is the largest unknown in these scenarios Morgan Stanley wrote ."

      "selftext": "Nvidia is requiring full upfront, non-refundable payment from Chinese customers for its H200 AI chips. Chinese regulators have temporarily asked some firms to pause H200 orders while deciding how many domestic chips must be purchased alongside each Nvidia chip. Chinese demand exceeds supply (orders >2M units vs. \\\\\\~700k available), despite domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend which lag behind the H200 in performance. The policy shifts financial and regulatory risk from Nvidia to Chinese buyers, reflecting Nvidia’s caution after prior losses from sudden export bans. Nvidia is ramping production but capacity expansion is constrained by generational chip transitions and competition for foundry capacity. Nvidia’s payment terms effectively offload geopolitical and regulatory risk onto Chinese customers, protecting cash flow and avoiding inventory write downs. Beijing’s actions toward H200 imports signals a deliberate attempt to subsidize and force adoption of local products while still selectively accessing top tier Nvidia technology. Allowing H200s for commercial use while excluding military, SOEs, and critical infrastructure reflects a is Beijing’s way of balancing AI competitiveness with national security. Strong dependency on Nvidia persists despite heavy investment in domestic chips, Chinese tech giants’ willingness to prepay underscores continued reliance on Nvidia for cutting edge AI training. Rapid reversals in U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures suggest that capital discipline and flexible supply allocation are now core competitive advantages for Nvidia. Full prepayment, high unit prices, and excess demand indicate Nvidia retains exceptional pricing power, even in politically constrained markets which is something few hardware firms can sustain. Nvidia is monetizing Chinese demand while insulating itself from policy whiplash, and China is using regulatory approval to extract industrial policy concessions leaving buyers to absorb the uncertainty in exchange for access to best in class AI compute.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia is requiring full upfront nonrefundable payment from Chinese customers for its H200 AI chips . Chinese regulators have temporarily asked some firms to pause H200 orders while deciding how many domestic chips must be purchased alongside each Nvidia chip . Chinese demand exceeds supply orders 2M units vs. 700k available despite domestic alternatives like Huawei ’ s Ascend which lag behind the H200 in performance . The policy shifts financial and regulatory risk from Nvidia to Chinese buyers reflecting Nvidia ’ s caution after prior losses from sudden export bans . Nvidia is ramping production but capacity expansion is constrained by generational chip transitions and competition for foundry capacity . Nvidia ’ s payment terms effectively offload geopolitical and regulatory risk onto Chinese customers protecting cash flow and avoiding inventory write downs . Beijing ’ s actions toward H200 imports signals a deliberate attempt to subsidize and force adoption of local products while still selectively accessing top tier Nvidia technology . Allowing H200s for commercial use while excluding military SOEs and critical infrastructure reflects a is Beijing ’ s way of balancing AI competitiveness with national security . Strong dependency on Nvidia persists despite heavy investment in domestic chips Chinese tech giants ’ willingness to prepay underscores continued reliance on Nvidia for cutting edge AI training . Rapid reversals in U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures suggest that capital discipline and flexible supply allocation are now core competitive advantages for Nvidia . Full prepayment high unit prices and excess demand indicate Nvidia retains exceptional pricing power even in politically constrained markets which is something few hardware firms can sustain . Nvidia is monetizing Chinese demand while insulating itself from policy whiplash and China is using regulatory approval to extract industrial policy concessions leaving buyers to absorb the uncertainty in exchange for access to best in class AI compute ."

      "selftext": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT (IIPR, preferred stock IIPR.PRA)? IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and, in simple terms, targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies. Marijuana companies - although a good chunk of states have legalized - are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium, on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space. IIPR has always been profitable and never missed a dividend. Based on their most recent 10Q filing, they have $2.3 billion in assets - mainly the land and facilities they own - to about $340 million in debt. Recently, their income has gone down as - with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity - they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16% of their revenue over the past year. But, even with that hit, their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs. Accordingly, from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $1.8 billion; and, in general, even if all premiums for their rent went away - i.e., their revenues got cut in 1/3 - they would still be profitable. IIPR's common stock is trading down and has a 15% yield right now, which is priced like it will get cut. But, their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal. It has a 9.5% dividend yield - which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends - and is trading at about 5% below par value. Additionally, the preferred stock value issued is only $44 million. With an approximately $1.8 billion equity cushion, it seems like the $44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected. And, to top it off you're getting a 9.5% yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time. But, even if it did get called, because it's currently trading 5% below call value, even then you would still get a return. **Summary**: IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under. You get 9% yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but, even then, you would still get a 5% immediate return on being called.",

      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

USAA decided to get out of that market and transferred everything over to Charles Schwab. I got annoyed and opened a new Roth IRA directly with Vanguard and pretty much forgot about the first one. I have only been contributing to the new account since. I got a statement in the mail and it turns out compound interest works and I find I have about $76k in this orphan Charles Schwab account. I’d like to move that money over to my Vanguard Roth without paying any penalties. Anyone have any idea how I should go about it?",

      "selftext": "Circle issues USDC on demand: users deposit USD, and Circle mints equivalent USDC, investing those reserves primarily in short-term US Treasuries and cash equivalents. Circle retains the interest income (after sharing portions with distribution partners like exchanges). The company benefits from a seigniorage-like mechanism in the digital realm-earning interest on reserves while scaling with demand for blockchain-based dollars. Few companies achieve 70%+ annual \"asset base\" growth with near-100% gross margins on the incremental revenue (interest minus minimal costs). Tech giants like Apple or Amazon grow revenue 10-20% in good years; Circle's core driver grew 73% in 2025. Low Risk: Reserves are safe (treasuries) Network Effects: Obvious.. Uniqueness: No other public company has this direct, leveraged exposure to money creation. Payment processors (visa) capture transaction fees; banks capture fractional deposits. Circle effectively monetizes the issuance and holding of private digital cash at scale With fiat money supply going to explode with ~~defence~~ war budget going up 50%, Trump's new Fed Chair coming soon with QE etc.- Circle shareholders might get rich.. 20B stock -for now. Yes? No? Go fuck yourself?",

It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for clarity. Trump claimed in the post that the move would help restore “affordability,” a word that has become key to Democrats’ political messaging as they accuse the Republican president of failing to address high prices.

      "selftext": "Hi all, My family has an antiquated tradition of gifting savings bonds to young relatives that I'd like to continue. I know that they're not a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there, but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool, one that stuck with me through the years. I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder, and I'm hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not a gift card. As the US Treasury Department no longer issues paper savings bonds, I'm exploring options from non-US countries. (I really do like the physical paper bond certificate, although it looks to be harder to find these days. Canada made a similar transition.) My base requirements in order (only the first one is absolutely required): \\-Legally purchasable by US citizen with no foreign residencies or dual citizenship \\-Minimum purchase amount $100 - $200 USD (open to going higher if needed, but I'd prefer smaller denominations) \\-Paper bonds issued if possible, electronic is fine but I'm sentimental. \\-Generally stable government in decent financial health, although my risk / reward tolerance is pretty high. Open to developing countries. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I recognize that this tradition is antiquated, but I think it's sweet and nostalgic. Thanks for taking a look.",

I know that theyre not_a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool one that stuck with me through the years . I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder and Im hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not_a gift card . As the US Treasury Department no_longer issues paper savings bonds Im exploring options from nonUS countries . I really do like the physical paper bond certificate although it looks to be harder to find these days . Canada made a similar transition . My base requirements in order only the first one is absolutely required Legally purchasable by US citizen with no_foreign residencies or dual citizenship Minimum purchase amount $ 100 $ 200 USD open to going higher if needed but Id prefer smaller denominations Paper bonds issued if possible electronic is fine but Im sentimental . Generally stable government in decent financial health although my risk reward tolerance is pretty high . Open to developing countries . Does anyone have any experience in this area I recognize that this tradition is antiquated but I think its sweet and nostalgic . Thanks for taking a look ."

Now my portfolio's looking juicier than a Cybertruck's design (controversial but profitable, lol). Bought in 2023, rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went \"💎🙌\" mode. Now? Let's just say my gains are giving main character energy. Elon might send rockets to Mars, but my bank account's already on the moon! Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing and let the chaos work its magic. P.S. If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot, my shares would probably moon so hard we'd need a new emoji. 🚀🌕",

Now my portfolios looking juicier than a Cybertrucks design controversial but profitable lol . Bought in 2023 rode the rollercoaster like it was a SpaceX launch—barely flinched when the stock went 💎🙌 mode . Now Lets just say my gains are giving main character energy . Elon might send rockets to Mars but my bank accounts already on the moon Proof that sometimes the best move is to do absolutely nothing_and let the chaos work its magic . P.S . If Elon and Trump actually tied the knot my shares would probably moon so hard wed need a new emoji . 🚀🌕"

I am 5-10 years from retirement and still interested in growth (not interested in moving to bonds etc). I need to move about 200K into other investments within my 401K, not all at once obviously. When I buy a stock or an ETF, I know the price at that moment. With a mutual fund I have no idea until the close and then it is too late to get that days price. I am not trying to time but it would annoy me to lose money based on trading today instead of tomorrow or the next day and it will add up. How can I guesstimate the price of a mutual fund at 2:30PM during the trading day (investment directives have to be in before 3PM).",

Its crazy. In 2025 (Q2) was a peak of 48$ per share, and during that time of Q2 were some massive sales of shares. Of course they sold at a very good price and took their profits. When your company's stock real value is around a few dollars, and it grows to 40-50$ in a short period of time based on good marketing and hype, and also you have tons of that stock as a insider of course that you're gonna take that big opportunity! They did TIME IN the market. They made millions. Good for them. The insider purchases of shares are a joke, which speaks volumes about how much they believe in their company.

When your companys stock real value is around a few dollars and it grows to 4050 $ in a short period of time based on good marketing and hype and also you have tons of that stock as a insider of course that youre gon na take that big opportunity They did TIME IN the market . They made millions . Good for them . The insider purchases of shares are a joke which speaks volumes about how much they believe in their company . Keep pumping the hopium ..."

      "selftext": "People’s fear of tech ETFs today feels overblown. Many avoid them because of talk about an “AI bubble” or because tech makes up a big part of the S&P 500. They often compare it to the dot-com crash, but that’s not the same in my opinion and there is why: Back then, companies were small, investors had little information, and rules were weak. Today, tech giants are global, highly regulated, and have multiple revenue streams. Microsoft earns from Azure and Windows, Amazon from cloud and logistics and these are not U.S-only businesses, they operate worldwide. So why the fear? These companies are transparent and strong. If something big happens, tariffs or pandemics, it affects all sectors, not just tech. And now, every business uses technology. Microsoft today is nothing like [Pets.com]( in 2000. So why all of this fear on Tech ETFs? What else can be the leading theme next decades if every invention requires tech? War needs tech, Health needs tech.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to get your opinions on my current PEA (French equity savings plan) allocation and my long-term investment strategy. For context: I'm 22 years old, still a student, and I invest with a very long-term perspective (15-20 years minimum). I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) on a monthly basis. Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan (PEA): * AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF (DCAM): **38%** * AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF (PAASI): **14%** * BNP Paribas S&P 500 ETF (ESD): **30%** * BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF (ETZ): **18%** So I only hold ETFs, no individual stocks at the moment. I would like your feedback on several points: * What do you think of this overall allocation? * Do you think any ETFs are over- or underweighted? * Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region? * Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation? I'm considering adding a more sector-specific ETF, for example, one focused on armaments/defense, but I'm not sure if it's a good long-term strategy or if it would provide real diversification. Another point: Do you think it's better to remain 100% invested in ETFs, or to add some direct stock investments in the future? Finally, an important point: This post is intended for an international subreddit, and my French equity savings plan (PEA) limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs, such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold. Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Id like to get your opinions on my current PEA French equity savings plan allocation and my longterm investment strategy . For context Im 22 years old still a student and I invest with a very longterm perspective 1520 years minimum . I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollarcost averaging DCA on a monthly basis . Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan PEA AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF DCAM 38 % AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF PAASI 14 % BNP Paribas SP 500 ETF ESD 30 % BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF ETZ 18 % So I only hold ETFs no_individual stocks at the moment . I would like your feedback on several points What do you think of this overall allocation Do you think any ETFs are over or underweighted Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation Im considering adding a more sectorspecific ETF for example one focused on armamentsdefense but Im not_sure if its a good longterm strategy or if it would provide real diversification . Another point Do you think its better to remain 100 % invested in ETFs or to add some direct stock investments in the future Finally an important point This post is intended for an international subreddit and my French equity savings plan PEA limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs such as the SP 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold . Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism ."

Novo already has the lead with its oral Wegovy and that has been a big part of why their stock has stayed so strong lately. Lilly clearly does not want to be left behind and is pushing hard into pill based options too. If Nimbus and Lilly manage to bring something effective to market, it could start shifting attention and money between these companies. Curious to see how this plays out for Novo long term since they have had such a big head start.",

Novo already has the lead with its oral Wegovy and that has been a big part of why their stock has stayed so strong lately . Lilly clearly does not_want to be left behind and is pushing hard into pill based options too . If Nimbus and Lilly manage to bring something effective to market it could start shifting attention and money between these companies . Curious to see how this plays out for Novo long term since they have had such a big head start ."

      "selftext": "Background: I’m 29 years old and currently have about $125k invested across TSP, Roth IRA, and a brokerage. About 20k in debt that I’m paying off (credit card with locked low rate due to SCRA)Very stable job making about 100k p/y My current approach is long-term investing with a heavy focus on growth, and I’m comfortable riding out market ups and downs. I’ve been looking at VOO vs VOOG and trying to think through the tradeoffs. I like the idea of focusing more on growth, but I also understand the benefit of just sticking with a broad S&P 500 fund and keeping expense ratios low. I guess what I’m really asking is: What are the pros/cons of investing in VOO vs VOOG when you have the time to ride the ups and downs? With VOOG being more tech-heavy, does the current AI money being concentrated in a handful of companies make it more unstable looking forward? Are there any big differences tax-wise between holding one vs the other in tax-advantaged accounts (Roth/TSP) vs a taxable brokerage? Does it make more sense to just pick one, or run some mix of the two? Curious what others think, especially anyone who’s held VOOG through different market cycles.",

Gemini shows up where questions already live inside Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace so new AI usage does not require a new habit, a new app or a new URL but it simply shows up.\" \\----- But I wonder the real reason behind this rise in traffic could be something else. Gemini has offered 1 year of free\\* subscription to Pro for Indian users. And it's one of the largest markets. So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that. So, it may not be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace. It's simply due to free subscriptions. In that case, there's a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends, given how price sensitive Indians are.",

We make around $10,000-$11,000 a month and have $30,000 sitting in our savings account from selling our first house rn. I receive a 2% raise every year and a few major bumps here and there to account for the market in my career, while her business is steadily growing more and more (she makes almost double what I do). We plan on doubling our mortgage every month towards the principal with an extra $1,821, then use an extra $2,000 a month to invest, and use the rest on wants like renovating our house, traveling, ect and throwing whatever is left for the month in a HYSA. The goal is the hopefully retire within the next 20 years and living off of our investments and my wife’s business while she takes a back seat and lets her employees bring us income (she co-owns a dog grooming and boarding business but just hired 2 more groomers) and slowly move a percentage of our investments into bonds as we get closer to retirement. I’m still in the beginning stages of my research on investing but basically my question is, would just investing the $2,000 into VOO and VTI right now be good for our situation and goals?",

We make around $ 10000 $ 11000 a month and have $ 30000 sitting in our savings account from selling our first house rn . I receive a 2 % raise every year and a few major bumps here and there to account for the market in my career while her business is steadily growing more and more she makes almost double what I do . We plan on doubling our mortgage every month towards the principal with an extra $ 1821 then use an extra $ 2000 a month to invest and use the rest on wants like renovating our house traveling ect and throwing whatever is left for the month in a HYSA . The goal is the hopefully retire within the next 20 years and living off of our investments and my wife ’ s business while she takes a back seat and lets her employees bring us income she coowns a dog grooming and boarding business but just hired 2 more groomers and slowly move a percentage of our investments into bonds as we get closer to retirement . I ’ m still in the beginning stages of my research on investing but basically my question is would just investing the $ 2000 into VOO and VTI right now be good for our situation and goals"

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and I'm shorting the fucking Naira",
      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections . If he wins the protections are gone the Naira tumbles . If he wins but Tinubu steals it from him again markets send the naira tumbling anyway ."

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

On its own thats nothing_magical but they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information . For example 1 most searched movie on Google 8 cents 100 cents Gemini Flash not_released by December 15 23 cents 100 cents 1 most searched athlete 35 cents to 100 cents 2 most searched person 21 cents to 100 cents There ’ s only one explanation they are a Google employee making bank off insider information . And it just so happens a few days ago the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting at least a 50 % score on FrontierMath ’ s Benchmark . So… that ’ s all cool and shit but how do I profit Well let me explain it for you simpletons Im loading up on GOOG calls at open AI is the market cap driver right now and with the Gemini 3.0 release everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But if Gemini can score 70 % on FrontierMath Thats a whole other ball game . That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers . his is a huge deal if this insider is right . They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents . Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something . Even if theyre wrong Google is mopping the floor with everyone else its not_even a competition . Ill have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they dont hit in the next month . Long live Google death to NVDA and thank you Google insider for the free loot .

Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28% Tuesday, their best performance since February, after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference. >The stock is on a tear, leaping more than 47% in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1,080% since hitting a low on April 22. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index Tuesday, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, both of which posted double-digit percentage gains. >“For storage, that is a completely unserved market today,” Huang said at CES Monday. “This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world’s AIs.” >Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jake Silverman. Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said. >Memory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60% to 70% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year. >Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “key beneficiaries” of the push for “AI inferencing and AI at the edge” in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4. Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage “skyrocketing in tandem.” In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology. >“The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending,” Mohan wrote. “As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate.”",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28 % Tuesday their best performance since February after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference . The stock is on a tear leaping more than 47 % in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1080 % since hitting a low on April 22 . It was the best performer in the SP 500 Index Tuesday followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc both of which posted doubledigit percentage gains . “ For storage that is a completely unserved market today ” Huang said at CES Monday . “ This is a market that never_existed and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world basically holding the working memory of the world ’ s AIs. ” Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks according to Bloomberg Intelligence ’ s Jake Silverman . Huang ’ s comments at CES “ suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems ” he said . Memory prices have been steadily climbing . Earlier this week Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60 % to 70 % in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year . Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “ key beneficiaries ” of the push for “ AI inferencing and AI at the edge ” in 2026 Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4 . Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training analytics and compliance purposes with demand for storage “ skyrocketing in tandem. ” In particular he cited growing use in drones surveillance vehicles and sports technology . “ The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models that has created the next wave in hardware spending ” Mohan wrote . “ As we look at 2026 and beyond we expect AI Inference to dominate . ”"

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening despite decades of consistent subscriptiondriven growth and high customer retention . The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations . The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI but it will remain durable . Background FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors asset managers wealth firms and corporates . Its product is embedded in client workflows which makes switching painful and churn low . For this reason retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure cutting headcount or seeing AUM decline . FactSet ’ s revenue doesn ’ t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity . Most revenue is subscriptionbased which gives the business strong visibility and predictability . That model has worked for a long time . FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades . Recent Earnings In its most recent fiscal year ended August 31 2025 FactSet reported • Revenue of $ 2.32B up about 5 % year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value ASV growth of 5.7 % • Net income of $ 597M up 11 % • GAAP EPS of $ 15.55 up nearly 12 % • Continued strong free cash flow alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6 % organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $ 2.42–2.45B . Why Stock is Low Margins have come under pressure mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment . FactSet however isn ’ t spending defensively — it ’ s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data . Why that Doesn ’ t Matter A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data . That matters in an AIdriven environment . Many competitors rely more heavily on thirdparty data which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top . FactSet ’ s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for . Position"

      "title": "Nvidia launches Vera Rubin AI platform at CES 2026, claims 4x fewer GPUs needed vs Blackwell and 10x lower inference token costs",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >AI powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA) announced the launch of its next-generation Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas. One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."
