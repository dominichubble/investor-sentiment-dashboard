This opening of potash would depreciate the price which would impact Nutrien's bottomline. However, Belarus is a landlocked country so just because the US lifted the sanctions, the European sanctions are still there which means they still can't get to international markets. So here's two conflicting forces at play for the potash market. What is everyone's thoughts on Nutrien going into 2026?",

This opening of potash would depreciate the price which would impact Nutriens bottomline . However Belarus is a landlocked country so just because the US lifted the sanctions the European sanctions are still there which means they still cant get to international markets . So heres two conflicting forces at play for the potash market . What is everyones thoughts on Nutrien going into 2026"

I’ve been holding VOO, VTI, and SPY for several years now as they were my initial investments. They make up roughly 20% of my current portfolio. I’ve been debating trimming them every time I make an investment in an attempt to better balance my portfolio and pursue more aggressive investments after building a solid foundation. My question: is this an inherently good or bad decision? I know it’s more theoretical since the future market is all speculative, but I’ve read that at my age (27), the growth potential of the “base” stocks I’m pursuing significantly outweights ETFs & the time to recover from a significant drawdown (40% - 50%) would actually be quicker by relocating funds.",

      "title": "Why the market has been going down lately",
      "selftext": "1. Forced Sellers vs. Optional Buyers This is the main issue * The Carry Trader: When the Yen spikes (because the BoJ hiked), these guys are underwater immediately. They aren’t selling U.S. stocks because they *want* to; they are selling because they are getting margin called. They are forced sellers. They need cash T-minus now. They hit the bid, regardless of the price. * The Domestic Buyer: Sure, U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks. But if you're a domestic investor, you aren't forced to buy *today*. You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think, \"I'll wait for the bottom.\" So you have a flood of \"sell at any price\" orders and a total lack of \"buy right now\" orders. That creates an air pocket, and prices freefall. 2. The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never 1:1 with cash. They are highly leveraged, often 5x or 10x. If a fund unwinds a $1B carry trade, they might have to dump $5B to $10B worth of assets (like U.S. Tech stocks) to pay back the loan. A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25% rate cut is likely buying with cash (1:1). Math: It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up. The volume mismatch is insane. 3. Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play. It only exists because there is a massive gap (divergence) between U.S. and JP rates. * Wide Gap: Free money. Everyone piles in. * Gap Closing (Convergence): The free money is gone. The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader. It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side. It’s not a \"meeting in the middle,\" it’s a pincer movement. TL;DR: Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains. Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire. One group is much faster and more violent than the other.",

They aren ’ t selling U.S. stocks because they want to they are selling because they are getting margin called . They are forced sellers . They need cash Tminus now . They hit the bid regardless of the price . The Domestic Buyer Sure U.S. rate cuts look good for stocks . But if youre a domestic investor you arent forced to buy today . You see the market tanking from the carry unwind and you think Ill wait for the bottom . So you have a flood of sell at any price orders and a total lack of buy right now orders . That creates an air pocket and prices freefall . 2 . The 10x Multiplier Carry trades are almost never_11 with cash . They are highly leveraged often 5x or 10x . If a fund unwinds a $ 1B carry trade they might have to dump $ 5B to $ 10B worth of assets like U.S. Tech stocks to pay back the loan . A domestic buyer entering the market because of a 0.25 % rate cut is likely buying with cash 11 . Math It takes 10 domestic buyers to absorb the damage of 1 carry trader blowing up . The volume mismatch is insane . 3 . Convergence kills the trade You have to remember that the Carry Trade is purely an arbitrage play . It only exists because there is a massive gap divergence between U.S. and JP rates . Wide Gap Free money . Everyone piles in . Gap Closing Convergence The free money is gone . The U.S. cutting rates actually accelerates the pain for the carry trader . It shrinks their profit margin from the U.S. side while the BoJ crushes them on the cost side . It ’ s not_a meeting in the middle it ’ s a pincer movement . TLDR Domestic buyers are walking into the store looking for bargains . Carry traders are running out of the store because the building is on fire . One group is much faster and more violent than the other ."

      "title": "The November ADP Jobs report is worse than you think, and a sign of what's to come",
      "selftext": "Plenty of articles have came out reporting on the 32,000 reduction in US private employment that ADP reported. This seems bad, but the reality is far worse. If you look at the employment changes by employer size, employers with less than 50 workers employ 120,000 less in November, whereas employers with >=50 workers 90,000 more, nearly cancelling out the losses from smaller employers. The reason this is notable is because smaller employers are faster to respond to changes in business conditions than larger ones, for a number of reasons: - Large businesses are generally more bureaucratic and involve annual budgets, so it can take time for layoffs to occur in response to slowing demand, whereas a small business with <50 employees don't have a long chain of management that makes layoffs a long process. - Large businesses are required to issue advance notice of mass layoffs via WARN. Businesses with <100 employees are exempt. This further delays large businesses seeking to downsize even after they finalize a plan. - Small businesses have less access to capital and higher borrowing costs to be able to ride out short to mid term impacts to cash flow, making layoffs necessary to manage cash flows when revenue falls. Larger companies have access to revolving credit facilities at low interest rates which addresses short term cash flows challenges. As a result of all this, small businesses are actually a really strong leading indicator of where the labor market will go. Large businesses, while slower to react to business conditions, are historically even more cyclical than small businesses. So we are likely to see a reduction in employment at mid to large private sector firms in the near future. Position: Lots of VGLT to bet on rate cuts and QE pushing up bond prices/yields down. Might be premature(I have no idea what numbers will show tomorrow), but I think the labor market is going to slow further in the coming year.",

      "selftext_processed": "Plenty of articles have came out reporting on the 32000 reduction in US private employment that ADP reported . This seems bad but the reality is far worse . If you look at the employment changes by employer size employers with less than 50 workers employ 120000 less in November whereas employers with 50 workers 90000 more nearly cancelling out the losses from smaller employers . The reason this is notable is because smaller employers are faster to respond to changes in business conditions than larger ones for a number of reasons Large businesses are generally more bureaucratic and involve annual budgets so it can take time for layoffs to occur in response to slowing demand whereas a small business with 50 employees dont have a long chain of management that makes layoffs a long process . Large businesses are required to issue advance notice of mass layoffs via WARN . Businesses with 100 employees are exempt . This further delays large businesses seeking to downsize even after they finalize a plan . Small businesses have less access to capital and higher borrowing costs to be able to ride out short to mid term impacts to cash flow making layoffs necessary to manage cash flows when revenue falls . Larger companies have access to revolving credit facilities at low interest rates which addresses short term cash flows challenges . As a result of all this small businesses are actually a really strong leading indicator of where the labor market will go . Large businesses while slower to react to business conditions are historically even more cyclical than small businesses . So we are likely to see a reduction in employment at mid to large private sector firms in the near future . Position Lots of VGLT to bet on rate cuts and QE pushing up bond pricesyields down . Might be prematureI have no_idea what numbers will show tomorrow but I think the labor market is going to slow further in the coming year ."

      "selftext": "TLDR: Altria is a deep value buy. The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood. The market doesn't see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers (largely young, non smokers) from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result. If On!’s growth follows historical and grows near 60% CAGR it will account for more than 75% of the company's oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20% of Altria’s total revenue in 2029 (versus a negligible 3% total total volume in 2024). Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. The market has overlooked on! as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altria's earning reports, guidance, and financials, but it doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altria's portfolio the market is going to **re-rate** the stock. [DCF]( Altria Group (MO) has a significant moat in the US cig market (45.8% of US Cigarette Market, 59.3% of US Premium Cigarette Market, 37.5% of US Smokeless Tobacco Market), but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever. And Altria's revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent. Cigs' share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60% in 2024 down from 90% in 2000. Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets (Altria operates only in the US in which \\~19% of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs \\~25% of Europeans 15 or olders). Altria's US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver (they sold IQOS system to PMI -> IQOS is the future of vapes) is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers. But Altria does have a growth driver, on! Altria bought Helix, which makes on!, for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on! did around 500M in revenue. US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50% 2020-2024. on! currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70%. Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28%-50% through 2034 ($250B+ Market). on! trails behind Zyn but still controls 30% market share in a near duopolistic environment. The market (and even Altria itself) is completely ignoring on! because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altria's portfolio. on!’s numbers are buried in Altria’s financials and earnings reports, combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “pouches” segment; on! doesn't behave like an oral segment product -> its not chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not cigs. In 2024 on! was only 20% of Altria’s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4% of revenue. If on!’s historical growth rate of 60% continues through 2029 on! will be 75% of Altria’s oral volume and 25% of total revenue. on!’s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not yet rated by the market. The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock, hoping all the while that the bleeding stops. Except not really. You're more than compensated for your time here. Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy (78.6% Payout). The company has committed up to $2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026, $1.3 billion remaining authorized. So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities. And despite falling revenues, margins continue to grow with no sight of slowing down. Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model, and as pouches scale, margins will widen there as well. In fact, the more we look at revenues broadly, the more it looks over played. Not only do they grow margins at every mark, if we excise tax is taken out from COGS, it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner. + if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood. The market sees this well observed declining trend (declining consumption of tobacco products) and views it as baked in and linear. They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed. But this is not the case. It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow. The bottom of the sentiment is in. Joe rogan says cigs are good for you. Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you. Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life. The evil tobacco barons of old couldn't have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke. The product is being authentically re-marketed to younger generations. & pouches growth is a manifestation of this. Pouches are not eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend, instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential. This implies significant customer acquisition to newer, non smoking, younger consumers. The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new, but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs. Some % (like 1 in 5) of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers, and in the US Altria controls 50% of the cig market, so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability, will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years. Regardless, the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US, indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced. I did a DCF which I've linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $78 with a MOS of 35%. I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions (bull v bear, see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on!). The DCF only affirmed the thesis. The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria’s product lines except on! fck it i just posted one of the DCFs (base case) cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go. Basically the DD shows **BUY** & hold Altria (MO) for 5 Years or until market re-rates the stock as on! becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria’s US cigarette moat.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Altria is a deep value buy . The US cig ecosystem is fundamentally misunderstood . The market doesnt see pouches as a growth vector for companies other than PMI and discounts the future attrition of customers largely young non smokers from pouches to cigs that will inevitably result . If On ’ s growth follows historical and grows near 60 % CAGR it will account for more than 75 % of the companys oral volume and drive the segment to generate more than 20 % of Altria ’ s total revenue in 2029 versus a negligible 3 % total total volume in 2024 . Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . The market has overlooked on as a growth driver because its baked into the oral segment in Altrias earning reports guidance and financials but it doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . Once it grows to a point of financial significance in Altrias portfolio the market is going to rerate the stock . DCF Altria Group MO has a significant moat in the US cig market 45.8 % of US Cigarette Market 59.3 % of US Premium Cigarette Market 37.5 % of US Smokeless Tobacco Market but the problem is US cig sales have been declining YoY seemingly forever . And Altrias revenues reflect this to even more drastic extent . Cigs share of nicotine market fell to a low of 60 % in 2024 down from 90 % in 2000 . Broad industry growth is now driven exclusively by emerging markets Altria operates only in the US in which 19 % of Americans 15 or older currently use tobacco products vs 25 % of Europeans 15 or olders . Altrias US cig moat and lack of apparent growth driver they sold IQOS system to PMI IQOS is the future of vapes is starting to be viewed by the market as a liability and as a result its trading at an extreme discount to peers . But Altria does have a growth driver on Altria bought Helix which makes on for around 610M over two entries starting in 2019 and in 2024 the on did around 500M in revenue . US Pouch Market grew at an average annual rate of 50 % 20202024. on currently outpaces the growth of the US Pouches Market over the last 5 years growing at an average annual rate of 70 % . Industry estimates project a US Nicotine Pouches Market CAGR of 28 % 50 % through 2034 $ 250B Market . on trails behind Zyn but still controls 30 % market share in a near duopolistic environment . The market and even Altria itself is completely ignoring on because as its stands now it is a inconsequential revenue or growth driver in Altrias portfolio . on ’ s numbers are buried in Altria ’ s financials and earnings reports combined with chewing tobacco as the total oral segment instead of a standalone “ pouches ” segment on doesnt behave like an oral segment product its not_chewing tobacco the same way cigars are not_cigs . In 2024 on was only 20 % of Altria ’ s oral units sold and accounted for only 2.4 % of revenue . If on ’ s historical growth rate of 60 % continues through 2029 on will be 75 % of Altria ’ s oral volume and 25 % of total revenue . on ’ s trajectory positions it as a core earnings growth driver not_yet rated by the market . The problem is that this DD implies a buy and hold and then wait for the market to catch up and rerate the stock hoping all the while that the bleeding stops . Except not_really . Youre more than compensated for your time here . Altria maintains disciplined share repurchases and a stable dividend policy 78.6 % Payout . The company has committed up to $ 2 billion in share repurchasing by the end of 2026 $ 1.3 billion remaining authorized . So here we get both buybacks and divs in a consumer staple that trades at a discount to peers in a macro environment with fearful sensibilities . And despite falling revenues margins continue to grow with no_sight of slowing down . Altria is largely insulated from tariffs given their domestic business model and as pouches scale margins will widen there as well . In fact the more we look at revenues broadly the more it looks over played . Not_only do they grow margins at every mark if we excise tax is taken out from COGS it shows that Altria has cut cost at every corner . if we read revenues net of excise tax it actually shows revenue growth But the thing that is most compelling here is that the US tobacco market is just fundamentally misunderstood . The market sees this well observed declining trend declining consumption of tobacco products and views it as baked in and linear . They think the future generations wont smoke and that cig is a staple of a dying breed . But this is not_the case . It is a highly addictive drug that will continue to grow . The bottom of the sentiment is in . Joe rogan says cigs are good for you . Dr Huberman says cigs are good for you . Cigs are a nootropic that stimulate the mind and actually make you smarter and better looking and better at life . The evil tobacco barons of old couldnt have devised a better psyop to get people to smoke . The product is being authentically remarketed to younger generations . pouches growth is a manifestation of this . Pouches are not_eating into cig sales in adding more speed to a declining trend instead the decline is stable and the pouch growth is exponential . This implies significant customer acquisition to newer non smoking younger consumers . The research on this is highly contested as pouch research is new but as these customers are acquired there will be some natural attrition to cigs . Some % like 1 in 5 of non smoking pouch consumers will ultimately become cig consumers and in the US Altria controls 50 % of the cig market so that moat that the market views more and more as a liability will only prove to be more and more of an asset in the coming years . Regardless the cigs are good for you psyop at the very least signal a bottoming out in the declining tobacco sentiment in the US indicating the declining trend is a lot less sticky than the market has priced . I did a DCF which Ive linked above which gave an intrinsic value of $ 78 with a MOS of 35 % . I then did a sensitivity table under different conditions bull v bear see assumptions in the DCF but the primary are revenue broadly and revenue in on . The DCF only affirmed the thesis . The bull case was achieved with declining revenues in each of Altria ’ s product lines except on fck it i just posted one of the DCFs base case cuz idk if the links are gunna work so sorry about that but there you go . Basically the DD shows BUY hold Altria MO for 5 Years or until market rerates the stock as on becomes a noticeable earnings growth driver and pouch industry customer acquisition growth results in customer attrition back to Altria ’ s US cigarette moat .

      "title": "Ford Takes $19.5 Billion Hit in Detroit’s Biggest EV Bust - Automaker is shifting to hybrid gas-and-electric vehicles",
      "selftext": "Ford Motor said Monday it expected to take about $19.5 billion in charges, mainly tied to its electric-vehicle business, a massive hit as the automaker retrenches in the face of sinking EV demand. The sum is among the largest impairments taken by a company and marks the U.S. auto industry’s biggest reckoning to date that it can’t realize its electric-vehicle ambitions anytime soon. Ford, which has lost $13 billion on its EV business since 2023, said it would bolster its lineup of gas-powered vehicles while shifting to hybrid and so-called extended-range electric vehicles that include onboard gasoline engines. The goal is to pull back from loss-making assets and redeploy capital designated for EVs to models with higher profitability. “Instead of plowing billions into the future knowing these large EVs will never make money, we are pivoting,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in an interview. “We now know enough about the U.S. market where we have a lot more certainty in this second inning” of reduced-emissions powertrains, he said. Regulatory changes and lackluster demand from Americans are forcing U.S. automakers to abandon plans to quickly step to an electric-vehicle future. Ford, which had bet big on EVs, is now making one of the industry’s biggest changes to its business. The company said it remains on track to produce a $30,000 EV pickup for sale by 2027, which the company says will be the first in a new string of low-cost EVs. “Now this is the core of our EV strategy in America,” Farley said. “We’ve got to land the plane.” The company will stop making an EV version of its F-150 pickup truck, called the Lightning, and will instead make an extended-range version of the truck. Last month, The Wall Street Journal reported company executives were discussing scrapping the EV version. Ford said that by 2030 roughly half its global volume will consist of hybrids, extended-range vehicles and EVs, up from 17% this year. The shift to hybrids is accelerating around the world, as those vehicles are increasingly seen as more affordable and practical to consumers who are reluctant to commit to pure EVs. To boost revenue, Ford will turn its Kentucky EV-battery factory into a battery-storage business for customers such as utilities, wind- and solar-power developers, and massive data centers that train artificial intelligence.

      "title": "DD: McDonald's MCD - Burger Joint Is About to Print Money",
      "selftext": "**TLDR**: McDonald's isn't a fast-food company. It's a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers. With 185 million loyalty users, an AI-powered digital transformation, a plan to add 10,000 restaurants by 2027, and 82% operating margins on franchise income, this \"boring boomer stock\" is about to break out. Stock is trading at $316 near all-time highs and analysts have a $335 target. I think $400+ is in play by end of 2026. \"We Are Not in the Food Business\" Listen up, you degenerate casino patrons. I know what you're thinking - \"MCD? Really? My grandma owns that stock.\" Well guess what? Your grandma is smarter than you, and she's been collecting 2.24% dividends while you've been bag-holding whatever garbage stock some Discord \"guru\" told you to buy. But here's what most people don't understand about McDonald's. Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said: \"We are not technically in the food business. We are in the real estate business. The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent.\" That's right. McDonald's is essentially a $42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism. The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps. The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued: The Real Estate Empire McDonald's owns ~45% of the land and ~70% of the buildings where its 43,000+ restaurants operate $42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93% of restaurants are franchised - meaning McDonald's just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4% royalties PLUS 8-15% of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue: 82% (compared to ~16% on company-operated stores) Let that sink in. When you buy a Big Mac, most of that profit doesn't come from the beef patty - it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonald's. They've turned fast food into a landlord simulator. 2024-2025 Financials Q3 2025 revenue: $7.078 billion (+3% YoY) Global comparable sales: +3.6% Systemwide sales: $131 billion across 43,000+ locations in 115 markets Market cap: ~$226 billion P/E ratio: 27 Dividend yield: 2.24% (they just raised it 6% in Q3 2024) Free cash flow machine - they literally print money The Catalyst Nobody Is Talking About: \"Digitizing the Arches\" Here's where it gets spicy. McDonald's isn't just sitting on their laurels counting rent checks. They're in the middle of a \"once-in-a-generation\" digital transformation that is absolutely bonkers: AI and Technology Deployment McDonald's partnered with Google Cloud and is rolling out: Restaurant Platform Edge - Cloud computing inside restaurants enabling real-time AI and IoT. Already live in hundreds of U.S. locations. AI-Powered Accuracy Scales - Weighing outgoing orders and flagging missing items BEFORE they leave. Deployed in thousands of restaurants across 12 markets. Virtual AI Manager - Introduced January 2025. This thing schedules crews, audits food safety, handles predictive maintenance, and basically runs the restaurant. Drive-Thru AI - Early pilots show 27 seconds faster service time, 10% more car throughput, and $65,000 additional annual revenue per store. Do the math: If they roll this out to even 20,000 locations, that's $1.3 BILLION in additional annual revenue just from faster drive-thrus. The Loyalty Program is Insane 185 million 90-day active users (as of Q2 2025) Target: 250 million by 2027 U.S. members visit 26 times per year after joining vs. 10.5 times before That's a 147% increase in visits. They're not just selling burgers - they're building a consumer data platform that rivals tech companies. And they just started letting users redeem points for things like Snapchat+ subscriptions. This isn't your grandfather's fast food chain. The Expansion Play: 50,000 Restaurants by 2027 McDonald's is about to experience the fastest unit growth in company history: Opening ~2,200 new restaurants in 2025 Target: 50,000 total restaurants by end of 2027 (up from 43,000 today) 1,000 new stores in China alone in 2025 That's adding roughly the entire Chipotle footprint every 2 years Each new restaurant = more rent, more royalties, more data for the AI systems. Why \"Boring\" = Tendies MCD has a beta of 0.52. That means when the market crashes, this thing barely moves. When your options portfolio is down 80%, McDonald's will be sitting there like a rock, paying dividends. Institutional ownership sits around 70-75% of shares DCFmodeling.com",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR McDonalds isnt a fastfood company . Its a real estate juggernaut and tech company that happens to sell burgers . With 185 million loyalty users an AIpowered digital transformation a plan to add 10000 restaurants by 2027 and 82 % operating margins on franchise income this boring boomer stock is about to break out . Stock is trading at $ 316 near alltime highs and analysts have a $ 335 target . I think $ 400 is in play by end of 2026 . We Are Not_in the Food Business Listen up you degenerate casino patrons . I know what youre thinking MCD Really My grandma owns that stock . Well guess what Your grandma is smarter than you and shes been collecting 2.24 % dividends while youve been bagholding whatever garbage stock some Discord guru told you to buy . But heres what most people dont understand about McDonalds . Former CFO Harry Sonneborn literally said We are not_technically in the food business . We are in the real estate business . The only reason we sell fifteencent hamburgers is because they are the greatest producer of revenue from which our tenants can pay us rent . Thats right . McDonalds is essentially a $ 42 BILLION real estate company that uses hamburgers as a rent collection mechanism . The Golden Arches are basically a REIT with extra steps . The Numbers That Should Make You Hard Let me break down why this stock is criminally undervalued The Real Estate Empire McDonalds owns 45 % of the land and 70 % of the buildings where its 43000 restaurants operate $ 42 billion in real estate assets on the balance sheet 93 % of restaurants are franchised meaning McDonalds just collects rent and royalties Franchisees pay 4 % royalties PLUS 815 % of sales in rent Operating margin on franchise revenue 82 % compared to 16 % on companyoperated stores Let that sink in . When you buy a Big Mac most of that profit doesnt come from the beef patty it comes from the franchisee paying rent to corporate McDonalds .

      "title": "Demand on the Rise as Platinum hits $1800 for the First Time in 15 Years",
      "selftext": "On the morning of December 15 2025, the spot price of Platinum reached $1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011, as of now it doesn’t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day. With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market, coupled with a bright industrial future, investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin. The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected. As of writing this, Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals. It’s estimated to be 20-30x more rare than gold, and 140x more rare than silver. Despite that, it’s currently trading at a ratio of 27:1 with silver, and a ratio of 1:2.5 with gold. In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum, and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold. You can see, these numbers don’t really reflect the rarity. The reason for that; Supply and demand. People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not currently in high demand industrially, and fundamentally that is correct, but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists. Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it, why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen? Scarcity, because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC. Did you know that there’s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person? Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream, metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can, sparking an “altcoin season” in the undervalued precious metals. Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly. As of today, there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams, and there’s even less than that available to buy, due to industrial use and hoarding. Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person. We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram. If we can take anything away from this analysis, I hope it’s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie. This number doesn’t come from thin air. It’s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined. The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion. 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person. To put this into perspective, the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home. About 8-10 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually. But only 1.8-2.7 billion of that goes towards bullion. 40-45% of Platinum gets used in industrial production. 30-35% goes towards jewelry. 20-30% goes towards bullion. If 40% of all Platinum goes towards industrial use, out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million. That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment. But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion. Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names, I won’t be factoring them into this analysis. Doing the same math as before, 193 million divided by 8.3 billion, the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person. Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in. According to the World Platinum Investment Council, 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion. If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion, this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out. That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC. You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum. Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved. But it’s not just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum. South Africa is responsible for 70-80% of the world’s Platinum, Russia is 16% of the supply, and Zimbabwe is 8%. This is between 93-100% of the world’s total Platinum. There are other places that produce minor amounts, like Canada. But there’s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common, they are all facing major crisis. As far as what we are being told, Platinum production in Russia has not slowed down due to the war. If you aren’t in the know, South Africa and Zimbabwe are not doing so hot. From a volatile political climate, food and water shortages, and major power outages. Pick your poison. South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa. Zimbabwe is still in a bad way. Ultimately both countries have a long way to go. How do these crisis affect the Platinum price? With electricity being in short supply, it’s in high demand. High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum. Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance. This is the result; Platinum mines being shut down, delayed, and abandoned. All because the price of Platinum is too low. With recent rises in Platinum prices, the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned. But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them. I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses. As the supply problem persisted for many years, inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply. 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit, and 2025 saw a 700,000 ounce deficit. That, and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100% rise in Platinum this year. But it’s not the only precious metal doing good. Gold is up 65% this year, after a 40% rise in 2024, and silver is up 120% this year after a phenomenal 2024. There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors. They have begun to notice that the ratios don’t quite make sense. We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum. Not only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option, but so is the jewelry market. If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream, Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor’s price range. The reason for this is simple. The more rare something is, the quicker the total supply can be bought out, which leads to both faster and higher price hikes. This is most certainly a star aligning moment here. If enough retail investors join in this new trend, the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person. However it’s important to consider that in 2022-2023 China, India, and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum. I think it’s because of them that the Platinum market won’t collapse in 2026, after years of deficit, 2026 is projected to potentially break even. It certainly can’t be because of mining, it’s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100%. This is ultimately good for the retail investors though, as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply. With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells, AI semiconductors, cancer treatments, and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries; Future industrial investment is not only guaranteed, but it’s guaranteed to grow. But what happens when industry can no longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition? It gets priced out of retail. What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal. It wasn’t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties, and we still don’t fully understand these unique properties. This is why Platinum is changing the world, and it’s also why you can still afford it. Your kids might not be able to. There’s simply not enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand, and it’s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important. TLDR: Less than half a gram per person currently, a 700,000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023, an increase in bullion and jewelry demand, and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable. You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals, it’s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too.",

      "selftext_processed": "On the morning of December 15 2025 the spot price of Platinum reached $ 1800 per ounce for the first time since 2011 as of now it doesn ’ t seem to be slowing down as it has continued to rise throughout the day . With increased demand from both retail investors and the jewelry market coupled with a bright industrial future investors and Industry may soon be competing over inventory after years of extreme supply deficits and low prices have worn the physical supply thin . The amount of available physical Platinum is a lot less than expected . As of writing this Platinum is the most undervalued of the big 3 metals . It ’ s estimated to be 2030x more rare than gold and 140x more rare than silver . Despite that it ’ s currently trading at a ratio of 271 with silver and a ratio of 12.5 with gold . In other words it only takes 27 ounces of silver to get 1 ounce of platinum and it takes 2.5 ounces of platinum to get 1 ounce of gold . You can see these numbers don ’ t really reflect the rarity . The reason for that Supply and demand . People often say that Platinums lower price is because the metal is not_currently in high demand industrially and fundamentally that is correct but this is 2025 and Bitcoin exists . Why do BTC investors so vehemently believe in it why does it keep reaching new heights despite just being numbers on a screen Scarcity because there is and will only ever be 21 million BTC . Did you know that there ’ s less than 0.5 grams of physical Platinum available per person Once the knowledge of Platinums extreme rarity and supply complications becomes mainstream metal investors and industry giants could flock to obtain as much as they can sparking an “ altcoin season ” in the undervalued precious metals . Some of the more rare metals like Platinum could become hard to obtain very quickly . As of today there has only ever been enough Platinum mined for each person to have about 0.8 grams and there ’ s even less than that available to buy due to industrial use and hoarding . Less than half a gram of physical Platinum per person . We are well beyond having enough for each person to get half a gram . If we can take anything away from this analysis I hope it ’ s seeing the importance of physically owning your families slice of Platinum Pie . This number doesn ’ t come from thin air . It ’ s estimated that roughly 321 million ounces of Platinum has been mined . The current global population is roughly 8.3 billion . 321 million divided by 8.3 billion comes out to 0.8 grams per person . To put this into perspective the total amount of Platinum that has ever been mined can fit inside of an average American home . About 810 billion dollars worth of Platinum gets mined annually . But only 1.82.7 billion of that goes towards bullion . 4045 % of Platinum gets used in industrial production . 3035 % goes towards jewelry . 2030 % goes towards bullion . If 40 % of all Platinum goes towards industrial use out of 321 million ounces that would be 128 million . That leaves us with 193 million ounces that you can theoretically purchase for investment . But the number is still lower than that if you add jewelry and bullion . Due to variability in prices of jewelry and bullion from irrelevant things like brand names I won ’ t be factoring them into this analysis . Doing the same math as before 193 million divided by 8.3 billion the new number we get is 0.5 grams of available Platinum per person . Again the real number is even lower still if we were to factor jewelry and bullion in . According to the World Platinum Investment Council 1.25 billion dollars gets spent from retail investors buying Platinum bullion . If 1.8 billion is spent on producing bullion this means that the total supply for the year could be within mere hundreds of millions of dollars of being bought out . That much money gets liquidated on a normal day for BTC . You can see that a relatively small growth in investor interest could quickly have a huge impact on the price and availability of physical Platinum . Less than half a gram per person can very quickly disappear if whales get involved . But it ’ s not_just investors that are going to have trouble sourcing Platinum . South Africa is responsible for 7080 % of the world ’ s Platinum Russia is 16 % of the supply and Zimbabwe is 8 % . This is between 93100 % of the world ’ s total Platinum . There are other places that produce minor amounts like Canada . But there ’ s 1 thing that these 3 major producers have in common they are all facing major crisis . As far as what we are being told Platinum production in Russia has not_slowed down due to the war . If you aren ’ t in the know South Africa and Zimbabwe are not_doing so hot . From a volatile political climate food and water shortages and major power outages . Pick your poison . South Africa has made some moves towards creating a better power grid which is a positive for the people of South Africa . Zimbabwe is still in a bad way . Ultimately both countries have a long way to go . How do these crisis affect the Platinum price With electricity being in short supply it ’ s in high demand . High energy prices and low Platinum prices creates a situation where the miners are losing money by mining Platinum . Couple this with the fact that Platinum is unbelievably resource intensive to refine due to its extreme heat and corrosion resistance . This is the result Platinum mines being shut down delayed and abandoned . All because the price of Platinum is too low . With recent rises in Platinum prices the potential for monetary gain for the miners has returned . But years of selling at low prices still weighs heavy over them . I suspect they will want to play it slow to avoid injecting too much Platinum back into the Market and risk getting caught in another cycle of losses . As the supply problem persisted for many years inevitably the demand for Platinum has greatly outweighed the supply . 2023 and 2024 suffered a 1 million ounce deficit and 2025 saw a 700000 ounce deficit . That and increased investor demand has lead to a near 100 % rise in Platinum this year . But it ’ s not_the only precious metal doing good . Gold is up 65 % this year after a 40 % rise in 2024 and silver is up 120 % this year after a phenomenal 2024 . There has been an observable shift in the silver and gold investors . They have begun to notice that the ratios don ’ t quite make sense . We are beginning to see a trend of people trading in their silver and gold for Platinum . Not_only are the retail investors now looking at Platinum as a cheaper investment option but so is the jewelry market . If this trend breaks out and becomes mainstream Platinum will quickly skyrocket in price and even a gram could become out of the average retail investor ’ s price range . The reason for this is simple . The more rare something is the quicker the total supply can be bought out which leads to both faster and higher price hikes . This is most certainly a star aligning moment here . If enough retail investors join in this new trend the whales will take notice and Platinum could genuinely become unobtainable for the average person . However it ’ s important to consider that in 20222023 China India and other nations were all massively investing in Platinum . I think it ’ s because of them that the Platinum market won ’ t collapse in 2026 after years of deficit 2026 is projected to potentially break even . It certainly can ’ t be because of mining it ’ s likely these nations are selling their Platinum after profiting almost 100 % . This is ultimately good for the retail investors though as it helps get rid of the maximum available supply . With world changing emerging technologies that use Platinum like hydrogen fuel cells AI semiconductors cancer treatments and the creation of new alloys that can greatly extend the lifespan of things like lithium batteries Future industrial investment is not_only guaranteed but it ’ s guaranteed to grow . But what happens when industry can no_longer obtain Platinum because of retail competition It gets priced out of retail . What the retail investor needs to understand about Platinums industrial use is that it is very much a new precious metal . It wasn ’ t globally refined and considered an element until 1750 because of its unique properties and we still don ’ t fully understand these unique properties . This is why Platinum is changing the world and it ’ s also why you can still afford it . Your kids might not_be able to . There ’ s simply not_enough Platinum to supply an increasing retail and industrial demand and it ’ s likely that the industrial demand will be deemed more important . TLDR Less than half a gram per person currently a 700000 oz supply deficit in 2025 after a 1 million oz deficit in 2024 and 2023 an increase in bullion and jewelry demand and a bright future with industrial demand could make Platinum become damn near unobtainable . You can see why some have begun to consider it the Bitcoin of Precious Metals it ’ s a hell of a lot more useful than Bitcoin is too ."

      "selftext": "I recently interacted with a financial advisor who is a strong advocate of dividend stock investing for a long-term buy & hold with automatic reinvestment. His thesis was that he could put together a portfolio of 30 stocks that would consistent yield an average of 6% in dividends alone so that his total return was never reliant upon any price appreciation assumptions. He presented some compelling back testing (nobody ever presents lackluster back testing) but generally, the thesis is an interesting one and not something I frequently encounter when working with advisors. I am in wealthtech so I interact with a wide variety of advisors, almost all of whom have their purported secret sauce. I didn't try to see into his black box for screening his 30 stocks, but I posed the question to GPT 5.1 Thinking to see what it yielded. It's a long response, so I've copied it into the pastebin link below. Obviously this would be most attractive in a tax-deferred registration, though I told it to ensure that dividends were qualified so they receive LTCG treatment vs. ordinary income which would make it more tolerable in a taxable account. There is a lot of color in the GPT response, but the example portfolio it provided is included. Other than concentration risk, what could be the potential stumbling blocks of a strategy like this? Cap gains from liquidating and replacing a position that has started failing the screen? (Not relevant in tax-deferred or Roth accounts) I'm not advocating for or against this, just curious.",

      "selftext": "Last Friday’s AI sector drop wasn’t just a fluke. It was a mix of earnings guidance and market noise pushing emotions. Oracle’s cloud business is growing, but with backlog conversion to profit becoming less certain, investors need more evidence that high leverage won’t hurt future cash flow and profits. Then there’s Broadcom, whose cautious outlook triggered some profit-taking. On top of that, rumors are circulating that due to materials and power shortages, some Oracle data center deliveries (used for OpenAI) have been pushed from 2027 to 2028. While Oracle denied it, this kind of news hits the AI supply chain hard. Investors are now wondering if growth is slowing, which means future revenue forecasts might need to be recalibrated. With how things are going right now, I’d love to hear what everyone thinks. Is this the perfect time to buy the dip, or is this just the beginning of the next bear market?",

Oracle ’ s cloud business is growing but with backlog conversion to profit becoming less certain investors need more evidence that high leverage won ’ t hurt future cash flow and profits . Then there ’ s Broadcom whose cautious outlook triggered some profittaking . On top of that rumors are circulating that due to materials and power shortages some Oracle data center deliveries used for OpenAI have been pushed from 2027 to 2028 . While Oracle denied it this kind of news hits the AI supply chain hard . Investors are now wondering if growth is slowing which means future revenue forecasts might need to be recalibrated . With how things are going right now I ’ d love to hear what everyone thinks . Is this the perfect time to buy the dip or is this just the beginning of the next bear market"

      "selftext": "There’s been a lot of renewed chatter around SpaceX finally going public, and if the reported timelines and valuations are even close to accurate, this wouldn’t just be another high-profile IPO it would be a market-defining event. According to recent reports, SpaceX is preparing for a public listing as soon as next year, with a valuation being floated around $1.5 trillion. That would put it well ahead of Saudi Aramco’s 2019 IPO, which currently holds the title for the largest public offering in history. Even a significantly discounted IPO valuation would still land SpaceX among the most valuable companies on the planet from day one. What’s interesting is how wide the ripple effects could be. SpaceX isn’t just a rocket company anymore it’s launch services, Starlink, defense contracts, satellite infrastructure, and potentially a backbone for global connectivity. An IPO at that scale would immediately force investors to rethink valuations across the broader aerospace and defense sector, especially for publicly traded peers that currently trade at a fraction of SpaceX’s implied multiples. The early winners are already obvious. Private investors who got in years ago at far lower valuations stand to see massive gains. Investment banks are likely lining up aggressively for underwriting roles, since a deal of this size would be a rare blockbuster in an IPO market that’s been relatively cautious. Public-market investors, meanwhile, may face a very different question: how much of SpaceX’s future growth is already priced in at a trillion-plus valuation? There’s also the question of timing. Markets are increasingly concentrated in mega-cap names, and a SpaceX IPO would instantly become one of the most influential stocks in major indices if included. That could pull capital from other growth names or even reshape index construction and fund allocations. At the same time, risks shouldn’t be ignored. SpaceX operates in a capital-intensive, regulation-heavy industry, with a CEO who is both a visionary and a source of controversy. Public shareholders would need to get comfortable with volatility, political risk, and long-term execution rather than near-term profitability. Whether or not SpaceX actually comes to market next year, the fact that a $1+ trillion aerospace IPO is even being discussed says a lot about how much the space economy and investor appetite for it has evolved. If it happens, it’s hard to overstate how significant it would be for Wall Street, the space industry, and public markets as a whole. Source",

According to recent reports SpaceX is preparing for a public listing as soon as next year with a valuation being floated around $ 1.5 trillion . That would put it well ahead of Saudi Aramco ’ s 2019 IPO which currently holds the title for the largest public offering in history . Even a significantly discounted IPO valuation would still land SpaceX among the most valuable companies on the planet from day one . What ’ s interesting is how wide the ripple effects could be . SpaceX isn ’ t just a rocket company anymore it ’ s launch services Starlink defense contracts satellite infrastructure and potentially a backbone for global connectivity . An IPO at that scale would immediately force investors to rethink valuations across the broader aerospace and defense sector especially for publicly traded peers that currently trade at a fraction of SpaceX ’ s implied multiples . The early winners are already obvious . Private investors who got in years ago at far lower valuations stand to see massive gains . Investment banks are likely lining up aggressively for underwriting roles since a deal of this size would be a rare blockbuster in an IPO market that ’ s been relatively cautious . Publicmarket investors meanwhile may face a very different question how much of SpaceX ’ s future growth is already priced in at a trillionplus valuation There ’ s also the question of timing . Markets are increasingly concentrated in megacap names and a SpaceX IPO would instantly become one of the most influential stocks in major indices if included . That could pull capital from other growth names or even reshape index construction and fund allocations . At the same time risks shouldn ’ t be ignored . SpaceX operates in a capitalintensive regulationheavy industry with a CEO who is both a visionary and a source of controversy . Public shareholders would need to get comfortable with volatility political risk and longterm execution rather than nearterm profitability . Whether or not_SpaceX actually comes to market next year the fact that a $ 1 trillion aerospace IPO is even being discussed says a lot about how much the space economy and investor appetite for it has evolved . If it happens it ’ s hard to overstate how significant it would be for Wall Street the space industry and public markets as a whole . Source"

Sunshine Biopharma’s Canadian arm, Nora Pharma, just received Health Canada approval for Domperidone, a widely prescribed gastrointestinal drug. This is not a trial-stage asset or a future filing. It is an approved prescription product entering a regulated market where Sunshine already operates. The company already has more than 60 generic drugs approved in Canada, which means the sales, distribution, and compliance infrastructure is in place. That context matters. Regulatory wins only have value when a company can monetize them. Domperidone adds another revenue-producing SKU to an existing portfolio, not a standalone bet. On top of that, Sunshine has recently launched generic doxycycline 100 mg tablets nationwide in Canada, followed by Pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug with steady long-term demand. Financially, the market is still treating these approvals like abstract progress.

      "selftext": "Iretired earlier this year and am beginning the \"transition\". I am looking at ways to: 1) Lower my exposure to tax-deferred assets. 2) Use my tax-free assets to generate monthly income. 3)Allow my tax-deferred assets to continue to grow in quality stock/bond funds. With respect to 1) above, I have started doing Roth conversions and plan to continue to age 75. If I do nothing, my estimate is that RMDs will push me into the 24% tax bracket at age 75. I also want to avoid leaving my heirs with a hefty tax bill to pay on their inheritance. The focus of this post is #2 above. I am looking at ways to start an tax-free income stream from our Roth IRAs. Advosors recommend that I consider an annuity, something that will tie up the funds ... and I do not want to do. I am considering investing this money (about $500K into an ETF that pays monthly dividends ... something like PBDC, SPYI, QQQI, or VGI. I calculate that some of these funds will pay about $2,500 per month in distributions if I invest the nearly $500K. Is there any other way (other than an annuity) to generate this level of income? Your thoughts? Thank you ...",

      "selftext": "Bank of America Securities published its US Rates Watch report on December 12, with a key takeaway that has drawn a lot of attention: the Federal Reserve’s newly launched Reserve Management Purchases (RMPs), while not QE in name, could generate QE-like market effects when combined with Treasury issuance strategy potentially compressing the 10-year Treasury yield by 20–30 basis points. Mechanically, the Fed is expected to purchase approximately $378 billion of Treasury bills via RMPs in calendar year 2026, alongside $181 billion of MBS reinvestments, absorbing roughly $560 billion in bills in total. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury is projected to increase short-term bill issuance by about $500 billion in 2026, while reducing longer dated coupon issuance by roughly $600 billion. As BofA strategist Meghan Swiber puts it, “This parallel offset between the Fed balance sheet and UST issuance has a flavor of financial repression.” Scenario analysis suggests that if the Treasury continues to delay coupon issuance, the cumulative reduction in 10-year duration-equivalent supply over FY26–FY27 could reach $700 billion to $1 trillion, effectively injecting 20–30 bps of net easing into the market. Based on this framework, BofA favors long positions in 2-year swap spreads and 5-year real yields, while remaining bearish on near-term rate volatility. Taken together, the implication is that financial conditions may already be easing even without an explicit shift in the policy rate itself.",

      "selftext": "The economy will likely perform well at the asset-price level in 2026 after some volatility at the beginning of the year, even as the real economy continues to lag, inflation remains sticky and small business continues to struggle with higher borrowing costs. I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI data-center CapEx binge. Oracle, in particular, is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers. This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue. If they keep spending without near-term revenue to match, the market will continue to reprice the stock downward, emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load. They won’t be allowed to fail however. Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts, a de facto bailout is the base case. Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit. The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them, while the real economy continues to absorb the losses, with this wealth effect supporting prices. Markets are likely to re-inflate mid-year, as Q2 earnings, CapEx spending milestones, and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported. Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle, and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well. We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer, but only by masking the slowdown beneath. That’s how I anticipate the next year playing out.",

I could see one of the hyperscalers or Oracle stumbling under the weight of the AI datacenter CapEx binge . Oracle in particular is levered to heavy infrastructure spending in a cloud market where it lacks the scale advantages of its peers . This growth scare will be triggered by another bad earnings call showing a gap between soaring CapEx and the conversion of its backlog into billable cloud revenue . If they keep spending without nearterm revenue to match the market will continue to reprice the stock downward emphasizing its negative free cash flow and debt load . They won ’ t be allowed to fail however . Between regulatory forbearance and government contracts a de facto bailout is the base case . Ellison being tight with Trump just makes that protection more explicit . The priority will be preserving asset values and the rent streams tied to them while the real economy continues to absorb the losses with this wealth effect supporting prices . Markets are likely to reinflate midyear as Q2 earnings CapEx spending milestones and government contract renewals confirm that the hyperscalers and Oracle remain systemically supported . Data center buildouts likely mark the peak of the CapEx cycle and those positioned closest to these capital flows will do well . We may also see a genuine breakthrough in chip efficiency or processing speed that will extend asset valuations a bit longer but only by masking the slowdown beneath . That ’ s how I anticipate the next year playing out ."

      "selftext": "I closed my positions in QFIN and FINV last week. This isn’t a rage quit and it’s not because I think the companies are trash. I still think both are real businesses. But I don’t like the setup anymore, and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience. When I bought them the thesis was straightforward: • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper, that’s usually a good combo. What changed? Three things broke the setup. 1) Regulation is back in the driver’s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025. The legal interest cap didn’t change, but the economics did. Loan pricing is coming down in practice. Banks are taking more control of underwriting and post-loan management. Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work. That’s a margin squeeze, full stop. When your business model depends on spread and fees, this matters more than valuation. 2) Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3. Not a crisis, but enough to force tighter underwriting. That creates a bad loop: • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3) Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me. QFIN guided to a sharp year-over-year earnings drop in Q4. FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits. That tells you management is playing defense, not offense. Defensive mode + regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion. But aren’t they cheap? Yes. Very, under 4x earnings. And that’s the trap. Chinese fintech sentiment is awful. Investors don’t trust the regulatory backdrop, don’t trust the macro, and don’t trust that rules won’t change again. You can argue that’s irrational. You can also watch stocks go nowhere for two years while being “right.” These aren’t broken companies. They’re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box. I’d rather step aside, redeploy capital, and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer. You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no where.",

I still think both are real businesses . But I don ’ t like the setup anymore and cheap stocks can stay cheap longer than your patience . When I bought them the thesis was straightforward • Profitable fintech platforms • Real scale • Strong data and risk models • Trading at very low multiples On paper that ’ s usually a good combo . What changed Three things broke the setup . 1 Regulation is back in the driver ’ s seat China rolled out a new consumer finance framework in late 2025 . The legal interest cap didn ’ t change but the economics did . Loan pricing is coming down in practice . Banks are taking more control of underwriting and postloan management . Fintech platforms are getting paid lower fees for the same work . That ’ s a margin squeeze full stop . When your business model depends on spread and fees this matters more than valuation . 2 Credit risk ticked up Both QFIN and FINV saw early delinquency metrics worsen in Q3 . Not_a crisis but enough to force tighter underwriting . That creates a bad loop • Credit risk rises • Platforms tighten lending • Growth slows • Market loses patience 3 Guidance rolled over This was the final nail for me . QFIN guided to a sharp yearoveryear earnings drop in Q4 . FINV cut its growth outlook to low single digits . That tells you management is playing defense not_offense . Defensive mode regulatory pressure rarely leads to multiple expansion . But aren ’ t they cheap Yes . Very under 4x earnings . And that ’ s the trap . Chinese fintech sentiment is awful . Investors don ’ t trust the regulatory backdrop don ’ t trust the macro and don ’ t trust that rules won ’ t change again . You can argue that ’ s irrational . You can also watch stocks go nowhere_for two years while being “ right. ” These aren ’ t broken companies . They ’ re businesses caught in a tough regulatory and macro box . I ’ d rather step aside redeploy capital and focus on setups where the path forward is clearer . You can take the contrarian view but your capital will be stuck for a couple of years going no_where ."

      "selftext": "Investing.com -- Zillow Group Inc (NASDAQ:ZG) stock fell over 5.5% Monday as investors reacted to news that Google is testing a new real estate advertising format that could potentially compete with Zillow's services. The search giant has introduced a mobile-centric real estate ad format that provides comprehensive property details, options to request home tours, and displays similar listings directly within search results. This new format allows users to schedule home showings with \"top-rated\" local agents through a \"Request a tour\" button, with an expected response time of 15 minutes. Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng noted that while the immediate impact on Zillow may be limited, the development represents a potential long-term risk. \"While we don't expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow's business, given that most of Zillow's traffic is direct and Google's new product is currently limited to select markets and mobile browsers, we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,\" wrote Ng, who maintains a Neutral rating on the stock. Google's new ad product is a collaboration with real estate analytics and brokerage firm ComeHome, which sources listings reportedly from the Multiple Listing Service rather than directly from listing agents. The format directly competes with Zillow's Premier Agent program by facilitating lead generation for buy-side agents from prospective homebuyers. The new Google feature embeds capabilities typically found on real estate portals, including filters for bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, price, and new listing status, potentially challenging Zillow's position as a go-to destination for home searches. Key Points Google appears to be running tests on putting real estate sale listings into its search results. The listings allowed users to view the full details of a property’s page, request a tour and contact an agent — similar to the functions offered on Zillow.com’s online marketplace portal. “While we don’t expect a direct near-term impact on Zillow’s business ... we view this development as a long-term risk for real estate portals like Zillow,” Goldman Sachs’ Michael Ng said.",

Additionally, year end activities like window dressing, portfolio rebalancing, and tax loss harvesting enter their final window, with positioning for next year becoming the primary focus. Sector rotation is expected to continue. President Trump is poised to select his nominee for Federal Reserve Chair. Furthermore, a ruling on the constitutionality of reciprocal tariffs could be announced at any time. Weekend news flow was relatively quiet. The broader market failed to extend Friday's decline and rebounded moderately in premarket trading. SPY held its key support level on Friday, marking the 13th consecutive trading day of consolidation within a high-range. This signals a potential inflection point. Intraday, the lower support zone remains $679-$682, while resistance is tested at $688-$691 (this range slopes upward, with its boundaries shifting higher over time). Most stocks rose premarket, led by memory chips and equipment, copper and silver mining, and nuclear power. Tesla (TSLA) saw rumors over the weekend that its Robotaxi service has begun true driverless operations. Pre market, the stock again tested the upper boundary of its recent consolidation range around $470. A decisive break above this level could target new all time highs. NOW Technology's proposed $7 billion acquisition of Armis sent its shares down 5%. Today, continue monitoring the direction of leading AI related tech stocks, which need to stabilize quickly after Friday's sharp decline. This represents solely my personal view and strategy for reference only.",

      "selftext": "With many companies seemingly IPO’ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit, does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins? How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced? In cases like HOOD or Figma, many felt the valuation was too stretched, meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that’s what happened somewhat with HOOD. Do most of you focus on peer multiples, revenue growth, margins, and long-term TAM when deciding to participate? Given that, do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects -like Medline -offers a better risk-reward at entry? What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry? Taking examples of upcoming IPO’s like SpaceX - slightly overvalued, Stripe, data-bricks, Anduril (don’t know about them) but medline looks kinda good but don’t know if it would be multi-bagger. So, throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn’t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO’s. Let’s win together. Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together. TIA.",

      "selftext_processed": "With many companies seemingly IPO ’ ing at outrageous valuations to give VCs and angels an exit does it usually take time for prices to reset before a sustainable uptrend begins How do people here usually evaluate whether an IPO is overvalued or fairly priced In cases like HOOD or Figma many felt the valuation was too stretched meaning it could take years before the stock becomes a good entry despite strong businesses and that ’ s what happened somewhat with HOOD . Do most of you focus on peer multiples revenue growth margins and longterm TAM when deciding to participate Given that do you think a more reasonably valued IPO with solid future prospects like Medline offers a better riskreward at entry What overvalued IPOs ever make sense as an entry Taking examples of upcoming IPO ’ s like SpaceX slightly overvalued Stripe databricks Anduril don ’ t know about them but medline looks kinda good but don ’ t know if it would be multibagger . So throw your reasoning about what worked and what didn ’ t worked and how you will play 2026 IPO ’ s . Let ’ s win together . Make it a thread people come back and learn and we all win together .

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a massive uptick in ads and articles lately pitching Private Equity and Private Credit to everyday retail investors. The narrative is always the same: the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultra-wealthy have enjoyed for years. But I’ve been digging into the market data and I’m convinced this is fishy as fuck. It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players. Institutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently \"over-allocated\" to private markets. Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didn't mark down as fast, their portfolios are out of balance. They are effectively tapped out. They can't put more money in, and more importantly, they are screaming for cash distributions. They want their money back, but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and M&A is slow. This is where the retail investor comes in. Since the \"smart money\" is tapped out, Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running. They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell. You can see this clearly in the AI sector. We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality, often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no profit. Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains, but they having the problem, that if they would try to IPO these companies right now, the public markets might reject those valuations, forcing a \"down round\" that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money. The solution is to avoid the public market entirely. Instead, they move these assets into \"continuation funds\" or sell them on the secondary market. And who is financing this? It’s retail capital. They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in. The most dangerous part is how they structure it. They sell these as \"semi-liquid\" funds, but the liquidity is an illusion. These funds have \"gates,\" meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once, like in a recession, they simply lock the door. We saw this with Blackstone’s real estate fund recently. So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch. Just know that when you hear about the \"democratization of finance\" be very careful. “Democratization” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to, true to the motto: privatize earnings, socialize losses.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing a massive uptick in ads and articles lately pitching Private Equity and Private Credit to everyday retail investors . The narrative is always the same the brokers claim they want to give us access to the same high returns that endowments and the ultrawealthy have enjoyed for years . But I ’ ve been digging into the market data and I ’ m convinced this is fishy as fuck . It looks a lot less like an opportunity for us and a lot more like a desperate need for exit liquidity for the big players . Institutional investors like pension funds and endowments are currently overallocated to private markets . Because public stocks took a hit or stayed flat over the last couple of years while private valuations didnt mark down as fast their portfolios are out of balance . They are effectively tapped out . They cant put more money in and more importantly they are screaming for cash distributions . They want their money back but VCs and PE firms are struggling to give it to them because the IPO market is tepid and MA is slow . This is where the retail investor comes in . Since the smart money is tapped out Wall Street needs a new ocean of capital to keep the machine running . They need someone to buy the assets that the older funds need to sell . You can see this clearly in the AI sector . We all know valuations for AI startups like OpenAI are completely disconnected from reality often trading at over 100 times revenue with little to no_profit . Hedge funds and VCs who bought in during the 2021 hype or the recent AI boom are sitting on massive paper gains but they having the problem that if they would try to IPO these companies right now the public markets might reject those valuations forcing a down round that crushes their returns and makes them lose a shit ton of money . The solution is to avoid the public market entirely . Instead they move these assets into continuation funds or sell them on the secondary market . And who is financing this It ’ s retail capital . They are effectively moving assets from the pockets of savvy institutional investors who want out into the pockets of retail investors who are just getting in . The most dangerous part is how they structure it . They sell these as semiliquid funds but the liquidity is an illusion . These funds have gates meaning that if everyone panics and tries to sell at once like in a recession they simply lock the door . We saw this with Blackstone ’ s real estate fund recently . So you basically become the bag holder for assets that are too expensive for the public market to touch . Just know that when you hear about the democratization of finance be very careful . “ Democratization ” usually happens right at the end of a cycle when the insiders need someone to sell to true to the motto privatize earnings socialize losses ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a macro \"regime filter\" designed to detect high-probability crash environments with minimal lag. The goal wasn’t to build a high-frequency trading bot, but a robust asset allocation strategy that protects capital during deep corrections while participating in bull markets. I recently finished a realistic 20-year backtest (2005–Present) covering the GFC, 2018 Volmageddon, Covid-19, and the 2022 inflation bear market. **The Strategy Concept** The logic is simple: * **Risk-On:** When the market structure is healthy, go **100% SPY** (S&P 500). * **Risk-Off:** When the signal flags a \"Bear Regime,\" switch **100% to GLD** (Gold). **The \"Secret Sauce\" (Without giving it away)** Most indicators are lagging (like a simple 200 SMA). My signal combines trend following with **tail-risk pricing metrics** (measuring the market's perception of outlier events) to identify structural weakness before the floor falls out. **The Setup (Realistic Constraints)** I hate backtests that ignore costs or assume instant execution. To make this realistic: * **Rebalancing:** Weekly (Checked Friday close, Executed Monday open). * **Transaction Costs:** Included (7 bps per trade). * **Slippage/Lag:** Accounted for by executing the next trading day after the signal. **The Results (2005 - 2025)** Initial Capital: $10,000 |**Metric**|**Buy & Hold (SPY)**|**Risk-On/Off Strategy**|**Difference**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Final Value**|$83,297|**$181,817**|\\+$98,520| |**CAGR**|10.67%|**14.88%**|\\+4.21%| |**Max Drawdown**|\\-55.2%|**-32.9%**|Reduced Risk| |**Sharpe Ratio**|0.56|**0.88**|\\+0.32| |**Trades/Year**|0|**\\~7.7**|Low Frequency| |**Worst Year**|\\-36.8%|**-8.5%**|Crisis Alpha| **Why Weekly Rebalancing?** I tested Daily, Weekly, and Monthly frequencies. * **Daily:** Too much noise. Whipsaws destroyed returns via transaction costs. * **Monthly:** Too slow. By the time you switch to Gold, the crash has already happened (e.g., Covid 2020). * **Weekly:** The sweet spot. It filters out noise but reacts fast enough to catch major regime shifts. **Key Takeaway** The outperformance didn't come from leverage or picking penny stocks. It came from **avoiding the math of big losses.** * In 2008, SPY drew down over 50%. This strategy pivoted to Gold, preserving capital. * By capping the downside, the compounding base remained high for the recovery.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been working on a macro regime filter designed to detect highprobability crash environments with minimal lag . The goal wasn ’ t to build a highfrequency trading bot but a robust asset allocation strategy that protects capital during deep corrections while participating in bull markets . I recently finished a realistic 20year backtest 2005–Present covering the GFC 2018 Volmageddon Covid19 and the 2022 inflation bear market . The Strategy Concept The logic is simple RiskOn When the market structure is healthy go 100 % SPY SP 500 . RiskOff When the signal flags a Bear Regime switch 100 % to GLD Gold . The Secret Sauce Without giving it away Most indicators are lagging like a simple 200 SMA . My signal combines trend following with tailrisk pricing metrics measuring the markets perception of outlier events to identify structural weakness before the floor falls out . The Setup Realistic Constraints I hate backtests that ignore costs or assume instant execution . To make this realistic Rebalancing Weekly Checked Friday close Executed Monday open . Transaction Costs Included 7 bps per trade . SlippageLag Accounted for by executing the next trading day after the signal . The Results 2005 2025 Initial Capital $ 10000 MetricBuy Hold SPYRiskOnOff StrategyDifference Final Value $ 83297 $ 181817 $ 98520 CAGR10.67 % 14.88 % 4.21 % Max Drawdown55.2 % 32.9 % Reduced Risk Sharpe Ratio0.560.880.32 TradesYear07.7Low Frequency Worst Year36.8 % 8.5 % Crisis Alpha Why Weekly Rebalancing I tested Daily Weekly and Monthly frequencies . Daily Too much noise . Whipsaws destroyed returns via transaction costs . Monthly Too slow . By the time you switch to Gold the crash has already happened e.g . Covid 2020 . Weekly The sweet spot . It filters out noise but reacts fast enough to catch major regime shifts . Key Takeaway The outperformance didnt come from leverage or picking penny stocks . It came from avoiding the math of big losses . In 2008 SPY drew down over 50 % . This strategy pivoted to Gold preserving capital . By capping the downside the compounding base remained high for the recovery ."

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** **My take: MSTR doesn’t survive more than \\~3 years in most realistic scenarios.** BTC down → MSTR dies fast. BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends + interest. BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working. Different paths, same ending. Longer version for anyone who still has attention span: I’ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don’t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane, volatile bull runs forever *and* the market keeps clapping while getting diluted. At this point MSTR isn’t a software company. It’s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on. The stock trades like BTC on steroids. That’s great when BTC is ripping. It’s terrible when time passes. Here’s the part people gloss over: MSTR has real cash bills. Preferred dividends. Interest. Normal company expenses. Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash. The software business doesn’t cover it. So the whole strategy boils down to two options: * keep issuing stock * or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns. That premium is the entire engine. Once it shrinks, dilution stops being “genius capital markets strategy” and starts being “why am I getting wrecked every quarter.” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value. That’s the model coughing. Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk. I think boring Bitcoin is worse. If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two, volatility dries up, hype fades, and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash. Cash reserves buy time, not survival. And here’s the ironic part: if Bitcoin actually *wins* and becomes mainstream, I still don’t think MSTR wins. In that world, people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly. No dilution. No debt. No CEO risk. MSTR goes from “unique BTC proxy” to “why would I own this instead of IBIT?” So take your pick: * BTC crashes → MSTR blows up * BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out * BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering face-ripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely. That’s not a business model, that’s a belief system. Not saying it won’t pump again. It probably will. This thing feeds on volatility and vibes. But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown. That’s my take. Flame away. **Some actual math:** * **Bitcoin held:** \\~**650,000 BTC** (varies slightly with recent buys; order of magnitude matters) * **BTC value (at $90k):** 650,000 × 90,000 ≈ **$58.5B** * **Cash on hand / reserve:** \\~**$1.3–1.5B** (company explicitly set this aside for dividends + debt service) * **Annual preferred dividends:** ≈ **$85–90M per year** (cash, not optional long term) * **Annual interest expense:** Roughly **$200–250M per year** across converts + senior notes * **Total fixed cash burn:** ≈ **$300–340M per year** (before software ops, which are roughly breakeven at best) * **Runway math (flat BTC, no new dilution):** $1.4B ÷ $320M ≈ **4.3 years** * **More realistic runway (assuming some continued buying / volatility):** **\\~2.5–3.5 years** * **Important detail:** * Interest on debt → **cannot be skipped** without default * Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily, but **they accumulate** and make refinancing harder * Software business → does **not** cover these obligations * **Key structural issue:** The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV, issuing stock becomes value-destructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock. * **What forces BTC selling:** Flat BTC + compressed premium + fixed cash burn = **selling BTC becomes rational**, not ideological. Position: Small position, adding slowly. No options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ. Yes, decay sucks — but it’s still the cleanest way for me to play this. ￼​(DD assisted by AI)",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR My take MSTR doesn ’ t survive more than 3 years in most realistic scenarios . BTC down → MSTR dies fast . BTC flat → MSTR bleeds out paying dividends interest . BTC goes mainstream → ETFs kill the premium and dilution stops working . Different paths same ending . Longer version for anyone who still has attention span I ’ ve been looking at MSTR for a while and I honestly don ’ t see a future where this thing works long term unless Bitcoin keeps doing insane volatile bull runs forever and the market keeps clapping while getting diluted . At this point MSTR isn ’ t a software company . It ’ s a leveraged Bitcoin balance sheet with a legacy business taped on . The stock trades like BTC on steroids . That ’ s great when BTC is ripping . It ’ s terrible when time passes . Here ’ s the part people gloss over MSTR has real cash bills . Preferred dividends . Interest . Normal company expenses . Roughly a few hundred million a year that has to be paid in cash . The software business doesn ’ t cover it . So the whole strategy boils down to two options keep issuing stock or eventually sell Bitcoin Issuing stock only works if MSTR trades at a premium to the Bitcoin it already owns . That premium is the entire engine . Once it shrinks dilution stops being “ genius capital markets strategy ” and starts being “ why am I getting wrecked every quarter. ” We already saw MSTR trade close to its BTC value . That ’ s the model coughing . Everyone thinks a BTC crash is the risk . I think boring Bitcoin is worse . If BTC just chops sideways for a year or two volatility dries up hype fades and the premium slowly leaks away while dividends and interest keep draining cash . Cash reserves buy time not_survival . And here ’ s the ironic part if Bitcoin actually wins and becomes mainstream I still don ’ t think MSTR wins . In that world people buy ETFs or hold BTC directly . No_dilution . No_debt . No_CEO risk . MSTR goes from “ unique BTC proxy ” to “ why would I own this instead of IBIT ” So take your pick BTC crashes → MSTR blows up BTC goes sideways → MSTR bleeds out BTC becomes fully adopted → MSTR becomes irrelevant The only universe where this works long term is one where Bitcoin keeps delivering faceripping bull runs forever and investors keep accepting dilution indefinitely . That ’ s not_a business model that ’ s a belief system . Not_saying it won ’ t pump again . It probably will . This thing feeds on volatility and vibes . But zoom out and it feels less like a company and more like a countdown . That ’ s my take . Flame away . Some actual math Bitcoin held 650000 BTC varies slightly with recent buys order of magnitude matters BTC value at $ 90k 650000 × 90000 ≈ $ 58.5B Cash on hand reserve $ 1.3–1.5B company explicitly set this aside for dividends debt service Annual preferred dividends ≈ $ 85–90M per year cash not_optional long term Annual interest expense Roughly $ 200–250M per year across converts senior notes Total fixed cash burn ≈ $ 300–340M per year before software ops which are roughly breakeven at best Runway math flat BTC no_new dilution $ 1.4B ÷ $ 320M ≈ 4.3 years More realistic runway assuming some continued buying volatility 2.5–3.5 years Important detail Interest on debt → can not be skipped without default Preferred dividends → can be deferred temporarily but they accumulate and make refinancing harder Software business → does not cover these obligations Key structural issue The moment MSTR trades near or below BTC NAV issuing stock becomes valuedestructive → dilution stops working → cash runway becomes the only clock . What forces BTC selling Flat BTC compressed premium fixed cash burn selling BTC becomes rational not_ideological . Position Small position adding slowly . No_options access as a foreign investor so adding MSTZ . Yes decay sucks — but it ’ s still the cleanest way for me to play this . ￼​DD assisted by AI"

But I’m curious, at what point do you actually take some profit or rotate into something else? Maybe when the growth slows? Or valuation stretches too far? Or if competition heats up in the AI space and margins start to compress? I’m not planning to sell right now, and I’m definitely bullish long term. But I’m also trying to be a little more thoughtful about my positions and not just say “I’ll hold forever” without having some kind of plan. Do you have a specific metric or condition that would make you reduce your position? Or are you just holding for the long haul and planning to reassess down the road?",

      "selftext": "Fast casual has taken a dump and Sweetgreen’s been hit the hardest. But the reality is: \\- fast casual continues to gain market share, winner over casual dining ($15 salad made to your liking still beats a $15 salad at a sit down where it’s probably all Sysco with a 20% tip) \\- Sweetgreen just hired an old exec from Chipotle as their DAO to help with margins \\- $230m cash on hand, enough to get through 2+ years at current burn rates, ignoring the fact they’re slowing down new restaurant openings to help with capital spend, and their 10% layoffs this year and sale of Spyce which took 38 engineers off their payroll \\- valuation is way off compared to peers, about 1x sales vs 4x for Cava and Chipotle \\- they now have a 1.2% stake in Wonder, which owns Grubhub and the ghost kitchen space and is going to scale their Infinite Kitchen technology, where sweetgreen retains the license and right to purchase at cost + 5% \\- ask any AI to rank the top 20 fast casual restaurants and which one has the most premium branding, SG is always on top By the way: \\- 25% short interest \\- 95% held by institutions and insiders \\- it’s called “sweetgreen” \\- there’s an invite-only membership called “goat status” where you get various perks and when you pick up you get a black bag instead of a green one \\- every Becky I know loves sweetgreen. If you bought lululemon 10 years ago when they were all wearing it you’d be rich now \\- if you can’t afford an $15 salad then this isn’t for you. Go buy your $12 value meal \\- no one has ever complained about “sweetgreen shits” like they do with chipotle. Also all the others still use seed oils and make compromises with quality. High rollers can absolutely tell DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH! NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE.",

      "selftext": "Hear me out because I think many people do not consider this. 1. Many people will withdraw their investments when they *have to*, not when the market is particularly suitable for withdrawal. 2. This means that the market's average annual returns over the past 50 years don't mean that much if it just so happens that you have to withdraw during a market downturn. 3. This means the \"average return\" you are likely interested in is not \"average return till now\" - it's the average of \"return till X period, return till 2X period, return till 3X period, ... return till now\". This is a relatively different number from the \"average return till now\" number - depending on how you pick the \"X period\". This \"X period\" dictates your actual risk appetite IMO. For someone who feels they might have to withdraw on a day's notice (X = 1 day), the actual average return is a lot lower. Even with 1 month's notice it comes to around 7% per my calculations, not the standard 12% annual returns people assume. Now I understand there is also a large number of people investing for whom this is not strictly relevant because they have a decent emergency corpus. But nowadays many people are investing without that cover in place. The closest industry term I can find is \"AHPR\" (average holding period return) but it's not quite the same it seems? And also not that widely discussed. IMO it's unfair to the normal middle class investors that this is not clearly communicated to them. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Hey all, I’m looking to start building a Section 8 portfolio and wanted to get some feedback from those of you who’ve already gone down this path. Full disclosure: I’m not here for the “don’t do it” horror stories, I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants, just like any other type of tenant, and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening. A little about my situation: I’m based in Florida, but I’m considering investing out of state. Florida’s a tough market for single-family homes, especially with high insurance costs and the ever-present risk of hurricanes. I’m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere, but I need some advice on where exactly to focus. A few specific questions: * Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio? * How did you determine the market you’re investing in is solid for Section 8? * I’ve heard mixed things about Detroit, the houses are dirt cheap, but what’s the catch? Is it really a bad spot for Section 8? * Is a 5% ROI (after property management, mortgage, etc.) considered too low? I know ROI can vary, but what do you typically look for as a “sweet spot” for a sustainable portfolio? * Do you focus on 2-bed, 3-bed, or 4-bed units? Why? I’d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it. Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow, suggestions would be helpful, especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties, would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!",

Full disclosure I ’ m not_here for the “ don ’ t do it ” horror stories I know there are risks with Section 8 tenants just like any other type of tenant and I firmly believe it all comes down to proper screening . A little about my situation I ’ m based in Florida but I ’ m considering investing out of state . Florida ’ s a tough market for singlefamily homes especially with high insurance costs and the everpresent risk of hurricanes . I ’ m thinking I can find better stability elsewhere but I need some advice on where exactly to focus . A few specific questions Where are you currently investing to expand your Section 8 portfolio How did you determine the market you ’ re investing in is solid for Section 8 I ’ ve heard mixed things about Detroit the houses are dirt cheap but what ’ s the catch Is it really a bad spot for Section 8 Is a 5 % ROI after property management mortgage etc . considered too low I know ROI can vary but what do you typically look for as a “ sweet spot ” for a sustainable portfolio Do you focus on 2bed 3bed or 4bed units Why I ’ d love to hear your reasoning on what works best for Section 8 tenants and the numbers behind it . Any other tips you think or anyone do I need to follow suggestions would be helpful especially in terms of market selection or best practices for managing Section 8 properties would be greatly appreciated Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "The current S&P 500 bull market turned three years old in October 2025. Ryan Detrick, the chief market strategist of financial services firm Carson Group, points out that once a bull market hits three years, it has a much better chance of stretching to an average of eight years, based on analysis of data going back to 1950. Detrick's confidence in this market stems from the healthy earnings growth that tech companies have been clocking. Additionally, HSBC analysts expect the S&P 500 index to hit 7,500 levels, driven by the sustained spending on artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. Technology stocks in particular have clocked impressive returns in 2025, as is evident from the 22% gains registered by the tech-heavy **Nasdaq Composite** index. The good news for tech investors is that the Nasdaq is likely to head higher in 2026 as well, driven by a broader market rally. With gains of 81% so far in 2025, **Advanced Micro Devices** (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has outperformed the broader **PHLX Semiconductor Sector** index's 46% gains by a wide margin. This solid performance is a result of AMD's growing stature in the artificial intelligence data center market, where its graphics processing units (GPUs) and server processors are experiencing healthy demand. **Alphabet** (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is another Nasdaq stock that has done pretty well on the market in 2025, registering 67% gains as of this writing.

      "title": "Connecting the Dots on Tower Semiconductor",
      "selftext": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor ($TSEM). They keep looking at it as if it’s just another foundry. The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits, and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations. Here’s what I mean. This week, Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know: co-packaged optics (CPO) are taking longer to develop than expected, and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer. Copper reaches its limits, then pluggables will lead the next phase, and only later will we move deeper into CPO. That’s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled. Tower doesn’t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers. Instead, they are the \"boring but essential\" layer beneath it. They make the specialty silicon (silicon photonics and analog/power components) that much of the optics ecosystem relies on. And it’s not a small ecosystem. Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers, including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers. These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers, forming a chain that looks like this: $TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $AMZN (AWS), $GOOGL, $MSFT, $META. A clear example is InnoLight, a key player in optics/transceivers, which has partnered with Tower to build high-speed transceivers on Tower’s PH18 silicon photonics platform. InnoLight sells to hyperscalers. That shows the real connection in practice. Now, what makes this more than just \"another AI stock\" is the physics. Tower’s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultra-low-loss silicon nitride waveguides. This kind of \"on-chip optics\" performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics, like photonic gyros. Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work, and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers. Then there’s third-party validation: - Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers. - Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier. This isn’t just marketing; these organizations don’t give out awards lightly. Tower is also not limited to one small fabrication plant. They have significant geographic reach, including a majority stake (51%) in their operation in Japan (TPSCo). This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability. Meanwhile, competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital: - $GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics. - $INTC attempted to buy Tower outright. This indicates that the narrative of \"Tower is special\" isn't just a retail story. So the takeaway is straightforward: If pluggables are the near-term reality, and Broadcom has just reinforced that, then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on. Tower appears less like a \"foundry stock\" and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem, with actual traction, solid customers, and an edge in physics. That’s why the demand appears \"sensational.\" It’s not random; it’s structural. $TSEM $AMZN $GOOGL $MSFT $META $AVGO $INTC $GFS",

      "selftext_processed": "I think many people misunderstand Tower Semiconductor $ TSEM . They keep looking at it as if it ’ s just another foundry . The real story is that AI data centers are hitting physics limits and Tower is in a unique position in the supply chain that addresses these limitations . Here ’ s what I mean . This week Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed what many engineers already know copackaged optics CPO are taking longer to develop than expected and pluggable optics will be the standard for a while longer . Copper reaches its limits then pluggables will lead the next phase and only later will we move deeper into CPO . That ’ s significant because Tower is where pluggables are enabled . Tower doesn ’ t sell the pluggable modules found in data centers . Instead they are the boring but essential layer beneath it . They make the specialty silicon silicon photonics and analogpower components that much of the optics ecosystem relies on . And it ’ s not_a small ecosystem . Industry analysts report that Tower has over 50 silicon photonics customers including 7 of the top 11 datacom transceiver makers . These transceiver companies sell into hyperscalers forming a chain that looks like this $ TSEM → transceiver makers → hyperscalers like $ AMZN AWS $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META . A clear example is InnoLight a key player in opticstransceivers which has partnered with Tower to build highspeed transceivers on Tower ’ s PH18 silicon photonics platform . InnoLight sells to hyperscalers . That shows the real connection in practice . Now what makes this more than just another AI stock is the physics . Tower ’ s partnership with Anello Photonics demonstrates their capabilities with ultralowloss silicon nitride waveguides . This kind of onchip optics performance is hard to replicate and is crucial for precise photonics like photonic gyros . Anello has received U.S. Navy SBIR awards for their work and Tower has noted that this process can also be used for other customers . Then there ’ s thirdparty validation Coherent recognized Tower as an innovation and technology supplier related to silicon photonics transceivers . Northrop Grumman has consistently acknowledged Tower as a top supplier . This isn ’ t just marketing these organizations don ’ t give out awards lightly . Tower is also not_limited to one small fabrication plant . They have significant geographic reach including a majority stake 51 % in their operation in Japan TPSCo . This matters when customers are concerned about capacity and reliability . Meanwhile competitors are responding as expected when a niche becomes strategically vital $ GFS is investing deeper into silicon photonics . $ INTC attempted to buy Tower outright . This indicates that the narrative of Tower is special isnt just a retail story . So the takeaway is straightforward If pluggables are the nearterm reality and Broadcom has just reinforced that then the companies enabling pluggables at scale are the ones to focus on . Tower appears less like a foundry stock and more like a key supplier in the AI optics ecosystem with actual traction solid customers and an edge in physics . That ’ s why the demand appears sensational . It ’ s not_random it ’ s structural . $ TSEM $ AMZN $ GOOGL $ MSFT $ META $ AVGO $ INTC $ GFS"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m starting a long-term investment plan using a DCA approach and I’d like your opinion. I’m investing 150 euros per month, split between: * 60 euros into VWCE (FTSE All-World ETF) * 90 euros into CSPX (S&P 500 ETF) This means about 40% in VWCE and 60% in CSPX. From what I understand: * VWCE gives me global exposure, including US, Europe, Japan, and emerging markets. * CSPX is 100% US, focused on large-cap growth companies. Based on this allocation, roughly: * \\~84% of my portfolio is US stocks * \\~16% is the rest of the world * \\~28% of the portfolio is technology * Top 10 companies represent about 22–24% My goal is a long-term plan (\\~20 years), aiming for solid returns while maintaining decent diversification. I’m aware this is quite US-heavy and tech-focused. Do you think this is a reasonable plan, or would you adjust the allocation to improve diversification and reduce potential long-term risks?

      "selftext": "Wall Street sentiment is starting to shift more positively heading into 2026, especially after the S&P 500 and Dow both hit record highs in the same week the Federal Reserve delivered a rate cut. The timing mattered markets were already on solid footing, and the policy move helped reinforce the idea that financial conditions may stay supportive for longer. What really stood out to investors were Jerome Powell’s comments after the Fed meeting. Instead of pushing back hard against easing expectations, Powell sounded noticeably less hawkish than many feared. That tone gave markets room to breathe, especially after months of uncertainty around inflation, growth, and the labor market. It doesn’t mean risks are gone valuations are still stretched in parts of the market, and economic data remains mixed but the combination of rate relief and calmer Fed messaging has clearly improved confidence. Right now, it feels like investors are less focused on short-term scares and more willing to look ahead into 2026 with a bit more optimism. Curious how others see it: is this the start of a steadier phase for markets, or just another relief rally before the next macro test? Source: [",

      "selftext": "I’ve always been of the mindset that having some physical gold is important. I know there are many that might disagree, that’s okay, I have my own reasons. But I’ve recently been considering just going all in on gold. Currently, I have a decent emergency fund and a little extra. Then most of my money is in an all world fund (S&S ISA) and a little bit in gold. I don’t have any plans for any big purchases on the horizon. I’m not sure I’ll ever buy a house or start a business. I don’t need access to my funds for the foreseeable future. It seems that gold is pretty solid and will sometimes spike and dip occasionally. Should I just invest purely in gold? I’ll probably just hold onto it and maybe sell some when the market spikes every now and then. I’ll keep a little bit in the all world fund and I’ll buy more of that when it dips (with the money from gold when it spikes). I’ll continue to pay normally into my pension which is in an all world fund also. What do you think?",

But I ’ ve recently been considering just going all in on gold . Currently I have a decent emergency fund and a little extra . Then most of my money is in an all world fund SS ISA and a little bit in gold . I don ’ t have any plans for any big purchases on the horizon . I ’ m not_sure I ’ ll ever buy a house or start a business . I don ’ t need access to my funds for the foreseeable future . It seems that gold is pretty solid and will sometimes spike and dip occasionally . Should I just invest purely in gold I ’ ll probably just hold onto it and maybe sell some when the market spikes every now and then . I ’ ll keep a little bit in the all world fund and I ’ ll buy more of that when it dips with the money from gold when it spikes . I ’ ll continue to pay normally into my pension which is in an all world fund also . What do you think"

      "selftext": "Hello, as a non US and non EU resident, I would love to get an opinion on this dilemma that I have. Right now, I’m holding accumulating Ireland domiciled ETFs as a way to prevent US estate tax and US withholding tax. The tax officials of my country of residence still told me to report its notional distribution using the UK tax reporting documents provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis. What I’m worried about is that by relying on another country for tax treatment, a possible change in how UK treat accumulating ETF will result in me having to sell my investment due to not being able to report the dividends generated anymore. For example: as of now, a tax reporting document will be provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis on their website and can be accessed by everyone but what if this law is removed or the tax reporting information is moved to the UK tax reporting platform? I would have no way to access this at all. What do you think about this? Do you think I should keep my S&P500 + Developed Markets Ex. US ETFs or move completely to Gold or Silver since it doesn’t distribute dividends anyways so regardless of changes, there is nothing for me to report? I’m also down to changing to VT or VTI + VXUS and just realize the gains later when I’m close to retirement but of course, death is always around the corner (I may be overthinking, I’m still 21).",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello as a non US and non EU resident I would love to get an opinion on this dilemma that I have . Right now I ’ m holding accumulating Ireland domiciled ETFs as a way to prevent US estate tax and US withholding tax . The tax officials of my country of residence still told me to report its notional distribution using the UK tax reporting documents provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis . What I ’ m worried about is that by relying on another country for tax treatment a possible change in how UK treat accumulating ETF will result in me having to sell my investment due to not_being able to report the dividends generated anymore . For example as of now a tax reporting document will be provided by the fund manager on a reporting period basis on their website and can be accessed by everyone but what if this law is removed or the tax reporting information is moved to the UK tax reporting platform I would have no_way to access this at all . What do you think about this Do you think I should keep my SP500 Developed Markets Ex . US ETFs or move completely to Gold or Silver since it doesn ’ t distribute dividends anyways so regardless of changes there is nothing_for me to report I ’ m also down to changing to VT or VTI VXUS and just realize the gains later when I ’ m close to retirement but of course death is always around the corner I may be overthinking I ’ m still 21 ."

A bunch of outlook reports are out, including Vanguard’s latest (VEMO 2026): Vanguard VEMO 2026 Report: Dummary from report: Global diversification remains key, US large-cap growth is expected to have lower long-term returns, and they favor Fixed Income, US Value, and Non-US Developed Markets over the next 5–10 years. My Take & Plan:- I’m all about diversification and the “VT and Chill” approachit fits nicely with most long-term outlooks and I sleep well at night with it. My investments is and keeps being: Core: VT (Vanguard Total World Stock ETF) – sticking with it as my main holding. Small Tilt: A bit into growth/tech through the nasdaq and BTC, but VT remains the core. I reduced both tilts considerably and increased the VT base. Discussion Points Is Vanguard’s latest outlook/other major inestment firms' outlooks changing how you’re thinking about 2026? Would love to hear your thoughts!",

      "selftext": "Not financial advice - just a fascinating valuation case I’ve been digging into. A small-cap called **Acorn Energy (ACFN)** recently had one of the strangest disconnects I’ve seen in a while. # Quick background Acorn makes remote monitoring systems for things like: * backup generators * industrial equipment * energy systems * telecom and data center power setups Basically, once their device is installed, the customer pays **recurring monitoring fees** every year. So the business is part hardware, part subscription. In September, the stock traded a little above **$30**. After Q3 numbers came out, it fell all the way down to **$12.81**. It wasn’t a bankruptcy scare. It wasn’t a huge loss. It wasn’t a customer collapse. It was mostly **timing** \\- a large contract didn’t ship hardware during the quarter, so revenue looked soft even though the orders are still there. Today the stock is hovering around **$15.79**. Meanwhile, the company’s free cash flow is the strongest it’s ever been This is the part that caught my attention. Here’s FCF per share over the past few years: 2021: $0.05, 2022: $0.01, 2023: $0.03, 2024: $0.36, TTM: $0.75 That’s not normal growth. That’s breakout-level improvement. And it’s happening while the price is going the opposite direction. # Even more strange: the stock “looks cheap” with a P/E of ~6… but that number is fake They had a big one-time tax benefit in 2024, which artificially boosted earnings. The **real** way to value this business is through **free cash flow**, because monitoring revenue is recurring and shows up in cash long before it shows up in accounting earnings. For years the company barely generated cash, so P/FCF was ridiculous (180×, 200×, even 400×+). Now that real cash is coming in? **P/FCF is \\~20×** \\- the lowest it has ever been **by a mile**. Not super cheap, not expensive - just finally priced like a real business. Yet the stock is still down 50% from its peak. (keep in min that it still has ZERO debt) **Management says their long-term goal is mid-teens to 20% growth** This year might not hit that, but the industries they serve (data centers, telecom power systems, industrial backup power) are all growing long-term. # So did the market overreact? One lumpy quarter caused a 60% crash… at the same time the company is generating its strongest cash flow ever. My base-case fair value lands around **$18–20**, but curious what others think about the mismatch. Again - not advice, just a pretty interesting example of sentiment vs fundamentals.",

Since then the spinoff went up 3% but Honeywell went down 6%. The big catalyst is coming in 2026 when they seperate Aerospace. Should trade at a higher multiple as a standalone company. Also nobody talks about the quantum stake. They own 54% of Quantinuum. Based on the last valutation their stake is worth like $5B which is basically a free option embedded in the price. Quantum computing might be the next AI play? Maybe? Quantinuum might IPO in 2027. Price targets 230-260 USD. Now at 191. The fundementals seem fair here. Trading around 20x PE with a 2.5% dividend. Cash flow is strong but top line growth is slow. Is this a value trap or a smart sum of parts play. Anyone else buying?",

      "selftext": "I was born in the 90s, but learned that people were getting 10% APY on CDs in the 80s. That sounds like an absolute dream. An older coworker mentioned that interest rates were in the double digits as well but it would be worth it for me as someone not trying to buy a house. I guess I’m just wondering if folks here think it’s possible for rates to get to that level again. Even 5-6% APY would be amazing. Mainly because I’d love a risk free way to save. Right now, everything except my emergency fund is in the stock market, which has treated me well but I know that that money is not super liquid and the market can drop at any time. In 2023/4, I had a 5.1% CD and just wish we had that option (or better) all the time. It’s stressful having to invest in the stock market just to keep up with inflation since HYSA rates are not very HY. EDIT: I didn’t know inflation was 12% during the same time period. It did sound too good to be true…",

I guess I ’ m just wondering if folks here think it ’ s possible for rates to get to that level again . Even 56 % APY would be amazing . Mainly because I ’ d love a risk free way to save . Right now everything except my emergency fund is in the stock market which has treated me well but I know that that money is not_super liquid and the market can drop at any time . In 20234 I had a 5.1 % CD and just wish we had that option or better all the time .

      "title": "Sweetgreen Bagholder soon to become Bagholder of that Sweet, Sweet Green",
      "selftext": "I’ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen ($SG) for a while now, and if you listen to the headlines, you’d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy. The current sentiment is that we are in a \"slop bowl recession\", but I thought the market was missing something huge, so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations (Rebecca Nounou) and went deep down the rabbit hole. After looking at the tech, the macro setup, and the insane float structure, I think this is one of the most asymmetric risk/reward plays in the market right now. Here is the full breakdown. # The \"Slop\" Narrative vs. Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced \"slop\" that consumers are abandoning. I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping. I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist (someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera) to analyze the bowls. We concluded that it's probably not slop, given the ingredients, verified local sourcing, exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil, and complex recipes. While the internet calls it slop, the actual product is \"premium casual.\" IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too, citing the specific family farms they support. The point here is that the product moat is real; nobody else is doing farm-to-table supply chains at this scale. They aren't just reheating Sysco bags. # Scale & Fixing Operations (The \"Infinite Kitchen\") This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on. The number one complaint about $SG is portion inconsistency; the dreaded \"skimp.\" Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the **Infinite Kitchen**. These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight. They can crank out 500 meals an hour. I asked Rebecca about this, and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error. But it’s not just about happier customers; it’s about \"Economic Complexity.\" Think about Nokia. Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees, then pivoted to rubber, then to tech. They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology. Sweetgreen is doing the same thing. The market values them like a lemonade stand, but they are building a proprietary robotics platform. They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms, and if it works, their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry. Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen, Spyce Technology, to Wonder. Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founder/CEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space. SG got a $100m lifeline and about a 1.2% in Wonder. They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost + 5%. So as Wonder scales the tech, SG will disproportionately benefit. # The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025. Consumer sentiment is trash, tariffs are flying, and the K-shaped economy is squeezing the middle class. IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 25-35-year-old cohort trade down. They are losing the \"entry-level white collar\" lunch crowd in coastal cities. However, I think this is temporary. There's a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front. The price of real assets is rising, like gold, and stocks, and the fed is cutting rates, stimulating the economy. You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward \"Longevity.\" We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson, Oura Rings, and seed-oil disrespect. Health is the primary status symbol right now. People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food. There is a massive \"Trade Up\" happening where people are leaving generic fast food for \"clean eating.\" Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment, not just calories. The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear. # Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out. First, the margins. Last year they achieve 20% restaurant-level margins, so they can get back there. Also, the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least, according to performance of existing IK-fitted stores. They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs, which lowers occupancy costs. If they execute, they can get to mid-20% restaurant-level margins (Chipotle territory). Second, the cash. They ended Q3 with about $130M, but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $100M plus equity. That puts their liquidity around $230M. Based on their current burn, they have runway through 2027. They aren't going insolvent. They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 15-20 next year to focus only on \"A+ real estate.\" Finally, the main thing they need to drive down is G&A, which is currently way higher than peers at 18%. The sale of Spyce does lower this 2-3% points right away, and there are other levers to pull. Sweetgreen also recently hired an ex-Chipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins. # Meme Potential (Seriously) There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards. I looked at the ownership structure. 95% of Sweetgreen’s shares are held by institutions and insiders. That means the actual \"float\" available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5% of the company. On top of that, 25% of the float is short. This is a powder keg. Because the tradable supply is so low, any spike in demand (from a good earnings beat or a macro shift) creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts. There just aren't enough shares available to buy back. We’ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted, low-float stocks. Finally, there's an invite-only membership tier called having \"Goat Status\". Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up, among other perks. Who in their right mind wouldn't want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT??? *(Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. Do your own due diligence. I am long $SG)*",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been tracking the narrative around Fast Casual and Sweetgreen $ SG for a while now and if you listen to the headlines you ’ d think this company is about five minutes away from bankruptcy . The current sentiment is that we are in a slop bowl recession but I thought the market was missing something huge so I spoke with their Head of Investor Relations Rebecca Nounou and went deep down the rabbit hole . After looking at the tech the macro setup and the insane float structure I think this is one of the most asymmetric riskreward plays in the market right now . Here is the full breakdown . The Slop Narrative vs . Reality The biggest bear case right now is that Sweetgreen is just overpriced slop that consumers are abandoning . I wanted to verify if the product quality was actually slipping . I sat down with a legit NYC food stylist someone who gets paid to make food look good on camera to analyze the bowls . We concluded that its probably not_slop given the ingredients verified local sourcing exclusive use of EVOO and avocado oil and complex recipes . While the internet calls it slop the actual product is premium casual . IR pushed back hard on the slop narrative too citing the specific family farms they support . The point here is that the product moat is real nobody_else is doing farmtotable supply chains at this scale . They arent just reheating Sysco bags . Scale Fixing Operations The Infinite Kitchen This is the most critical part of the thesis that people are sleeping on . The number one complaint about $ SG is portion inconsistency the dreaded skimp . Sweetgreen is currently rolling out the Infinite Kitchen . These are automated assembly units that dispense ingredients by precise weight . They can crank out 500 meals an hour . I asked Rebecca about this and she confirmed that customer complaints drop significantly in stores with these machines because it removes human error . But it ’ s not_just about happier customers it ’ s about Economic Complexity . Think about Nokia . Nokia started as a paper mill chopping down trees then pivoted to rubber then to tech . They moved from raw resource extraction to complex technology . Sweetgreen is doing the same thing . The market values them like a lemonade stand but they are building a proprietary robotics platform . They are betting the house on automation and digital platforms and if it works their margins are going to decouple from the rest of the restaurant industry . Another interesting thing is that they sold the subsidiary behind Infinite Kitchen Spyce Technology to Wonder . Wonder owns Grubhub and has a legendary founderCEO trying to blow up the ghost kitchen space . SG got a $ 100m lifeline and about a 1.2 % in Wonder . They also retain licensing rights to the automated machines and get the right to purchase it at Cost 5 % . So as Wonder scales the tech SG will disproportionately benefit . The Social and Economic Macro We are sitting in late 2025 . Consumer sentiment is trash tariffs are flying and the Kshaped economy is squeezing the middle class . IR was honest with me and mentioned they are seeing the 2535yearold cohort trade down . They are losing the entrylevel white collar lunch crowd in coastal cities . However I think this is temporary . Theres a shift underway on both the fiscal and monetary front . The price of real assets is rising like gold and stocks and the fed is cutting rates stimulating the economy . You also have to look at the massive cultural shift toward Longevity . We are living in the age of Bryan Johnson Oura Rings and seedoil disrespect . Health is the primary status symbol right now . People are tired of paying restaurant prices for garbage food . There is a massive Trade Up happening where people are leaving generic fast food for clean eating . Sweetgreen is perfectly positioned to capture the demographic that views lunch as a health investment not_just calories . The analogy I like here is the trade people went from Nike when I was a kid to Lululemon and premium athleisurewear . Financial Analysis I dug into the balance sheet to see if they can actually survive long enough for this thesis to play out . First the margins . Last year they achieve 20 % restaurantlevel margins so they can get back there . Also the Infinite Kitchen can cut labor costs by 7 points at least according to performance of existing IKfitted stores . They are also shifting real estate strategy to the suburbs which lowers occupancy costs . If they execute they can get to mid20 % restaurantlevel margins Chipotle territory . Second the cash . They ended Q3 with about $ 130M but they just sold their Spyce technology to Wonder for $ 100M plus equity . That puts their liquidity around $ 230M . Based on their current burn they have runway through 2027 . They arent going insolvent . They are also being disciplined with capital via cutting net new store openings to 1520 next year to focus only on A real estate . Finally the main thing they need to drive down is GA which is currently way higher than peers at 18 % . The sale of Spyce does lower this 23 % points right away and there are other levers to pull . Sweetgreen also recently hired an exChipotle exec as their DAO to help with margins . Meme Potential Seriously There are some parts about the stock that make me think it has huge meme potential going forwards . I looked at the ownership structure . 95 % of Sweetgreen ’ s shares are held by institutions and insiders . That means the actual float available for retail traders to buy and sell is tiny ... only about 5 % of the company . On top of that 25 % of the float is short . This is a powder keg . Because the tradable supply is so low any spike in demand from a good earnings beat or a macro shift creates a liquidity crisis for the shorts . There just arent enough shares available to buy back . We ’ ve seen this setup before with other highly shorted lowfloat stocks . Finally theres an inviteonly membership tier called having Goat Status . Those with Goat Status get a black bag when they pick up among other perks . Who in their right mind wouldnt want to be a Sweetgreen GOAT Disclaimer This is not_financial advice . Do your own due diligence . I am long $ SG"

It could be new ipos like spcx - SpaceX, databricks, Anduril, midline etc or some new companies off the radar but can make a comeback or some undervalued companies which until 2025 haven’t achieved much but will have lots of updates in 2026 - still RKLB and ASTS and NBIS will have lots of opportunities this year to rise even further. So, let’s have a thread for 2026 uolooooing. Also, are there new industries popping up which one is aware of. Thanks in advance.",

It could be new ipos like spcx SpaceX databricks Anduril midline etc or some new companies off the radar but can make a comeback or some undervalued companies which until 2025 haven ’ t achieved much but will have lots of updates in 2026 still RKLB and ASTS and NBIS will have lots of opportunities this year to rise even further . So let ’ s have a thread for 2026 uolooooing . Also are there new industries popping up which one is aware of . Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "Goldman Sachs Asset Management is making a pretty clear statement about where it thinks demand is heading in the ETF world. The firm just agreed to buy Innovator Capital Management for $2 billion, a company best known for its defined outcome (buffer) ETFs. These products use options to cap both downside risk and upside returns, making them especially popular with investors who want some protection without fully exiting equities. The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year, and Goldman executives are already calling buffer ETFs a major growth area for the industry. Given how volatile markets have been and how nervous a lot of investors feel about valuations going into 2026 it’s not hard to see why. Feels like another sign that big asset managers are positioning for a world where investors care less about max returns and more about risk management. Curious if anyone here actually uses buffer ETFs, or if most still prefer simple index funds and bonds for protection. Source:",

      "selftext_processed": "Goldman Sachs Asset Management is making a pretty clear statement about where it thinks demand is heading in the ETF world . The firm just agreed to buy Innovator Capital Management for $ 2 billion a company best known for its defined outcome buffer ETFs . These products use options to cap both downside risk and upside returns making them especially popular with investors who want some protection without fully exiting equities . The deal is expected to close in the first half of next year and Goldman executives are already calling buffer ETFs a major growth area for the industry . Given how volatile markets have been and how nervous a lot of investors feel about valuations going into 2026 it ’ s not_hard to see why . Feels like another sign that big asset managers are positioning for a world where investors care less about max returns and more about risk management . Curious if anyone here actually uses buffer ETFs or if most still prefer simple index funds and bonds for protection . Source"

      "selftext": "We've been living with social media for close to 20 years now, and have willingly given the companies our data in exchange for interaction and entertainment. Generally, we accept that they profit by selling our data for targeted ads. I used to buy dark ads though META's Ad Manager in 2019. It started out very effective, but over time I watched the (non-bot) engagement go down while the price per click continued to go up. I haven't bought ads in over a year, but a quick search says the average cost per click is now around $.50. I was paying less than $.10 for a while there. As more and more ads were sold, it made greater competition for ad space and the rate went up - Easy to see how META makes a ton of money with this model. But doesn't it seem like FB/IG has begun to run its course as far as people wanting to use it? How and why do you see it maintaining and growing the Ad revenue in the long term? What's META platform gonna look like in 3 years? I think unless its something completely different, a lot of people will continue to check out. Lately there's a lot of resentment/backlash/reluctance (at least by non-boomers) to reduce our exposure to social media; as we now know the companies intentionally fuel societal/political division, contribute to emotional damage in kids. It seems that less people are posting personal content on a regular basis, sharing less. This makes the 'digital creators' who think the world needs to hear from them every day a larger part of the feed alongside all the paid Ad content. FB/IG are just less engaging than they once were. Unless you're watching reels - which, like tiktok just sucks people into an addictive and mindless loop of 10 second videos leading to 'brain-rot' - People are finally recognizing the harm of social media. Have a look at Australia's new social media ban for kids - coming soon to US. What impact will this have on META ad sales? I just don't see how it continues to grow with so many forces against it. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. TLDR \\~ I don't think META will continue to increase revenue. They might even be the company that doesn't make it through the AI bubble.",

      "selftext_processed": "Weve been living with social media for close to 20 years now and have willingly given the companies our data in exchange for interaction and entertainment . Generally we accept that they profit by selling our data for targeted ads . I used to buy dark ads though METAs Ad Manager in 2019 . It started out very effective but over time I watched the nonbot engagement go down while the price per click continued to go up . I havent bought ads in over a year but a quick search says the average cost per click is now around $ .50 . I was paying less than $ .10 for a while there . As more and more ads were sold it made greater competition for ad space and the rate went up Easy to see how META makes a ton of money with this model . But doesnt it seem like FBIG has begun to run its course as far as people wanting to use it How and why do you see it maintaining and growing the Ad revenue in the long term Whats META platform gon na look like in 3 years I think unless its something completely different a lot of people will continue to check out . Lately theres a lot of resentmentbacklashreluctance at least by nonboomers to reduce our exposure to social media as we now know the companies intentionally fuel societalpolitical division contribute to emotional damage in kids . It seems that less people are posting personal content on a regular basis sharing less . This makes the digital creators who think the world needs to hear from them every day a larger part of the feed alongside all the paid Ad content . FBIG are just less engaging than they once were . Unless youre watching reels which like tiktok just sucks people into an addictive and mindless loop of 10 second videos leading to brainrot People are finally recognizing the harm of social media . Have a look at Australias new social media ban for kids coming soon to US . What impact will this have on META ad sales I just dont see how it continues to grow with so many forces against it . Thanks for coming to my TED talk . TLDR I dont think META will continue to increase revenue . They might even be the company that doesnt make it through the AI bubble ."

      "selftext": "Most of the headlines this week focused on Todd Combs leaving Berkshire Hathaway, but the broader message in the announcement matters just as much. The company is clearly transitioning toward a more traditional corporate structure as Warren Buffett prepares to hand over the CEO role to Greg Abel in a matter of weeks. Combs, who joined Berkshire in 2010 and later became CEO of GEICO, is heading to JPMorgan Chase to run a new $10 billion Strategic Investment Group tied to its massive $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative. It’s a big vote of confidence from JPM, and even Buffett acknowledged the move, saying JPMorgan “made a good decision.” Beyond Combs, the personnel changes suggest Berkshire is tightening roles and formalizing leadership in a way that feels very different from the loose, Buffett-centric setup of the past. That doesn’t mean the culture is gone but it does mean the era of Berkshire running purely on Buffett’s instincts is ending. Feels less like a sudden shift and more like a careful, deliberate handoff. Curious how others see it: smooth evolution, or the beginning of a very different Berkshire? Source:",

      "title": "1-800-FLOWERS: The Liquidity Math - 18.8x imbalance - Another 100K shares borrowed overnight Saturday; 500K left",
      "selftext": "# FLWS: The Liquidity Math - What Actually Moves This Stock **TL;DR:** FLWS has a mechanical squeeze setup with verifiable numbers. 9.4M shares short vs only 500K available to borrow = **18.8x imbalance**. Shorts used 84% of their ammo and someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday. But this isn't just a squeeze play - it's a **$1.7B revenue company trading at 0.17x sales** ($285M market cap). That's priced for bankruptcy, but they're generating $93M EBITDA with new leadership (first non-family CEO + AI-focused CIO). The squeeze is the catalyst. The valuation is the floor. # SECTION 1: THE SETUP (VERIFIED DATA) Let me start with what we actually know: |Metric|Value|Source| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |Short Interest|9.4M shares|FINRA (Nov 28)| |Available to Borrow|**500K**|Fintel (Dec 13)| |Imbalance Ratio|**18.8x**|Math| |Average Daily Volume|560K-700K|Yahoo Finance| |Dec 9 Catalyst Volume|6.3M shares|Yahoo Finance| |Dec 12 Short Attack|2.5M borrowed|iBorrowDesk| **Sources:** * Fintel: [ * iBorrowDesk: [ * FINRA: [ # SECTION 2: WHAT MOVED THE PRICE LAST WEEK Here's actual price action data from the past 5 trading days: |Date|Volume|Price Move|Direction| |:-|:-|:-|:-| || ||||| ||||| |Dec 6 (Fri)|487K|\\+$0.03 (+0.8%)|Flat| |Dec 9 (Mon)|6.3M|\\+$1.24 (+33%)|Catalyst spike| |Dec 10 (Tue)|2.1M|\\-$0.17 (-3.4%)|Pullback| |Dec 11 (Wed)|1.1M|\\-$0.33 (-7.0%)|Continued pullback| |Dec 12 (Thu)|2.8M|\\-$0.49 (-9.8%)|Short attack| **Key observations:** 1. **Dec 9:** 6.3M volume (11x average) = +33% move 2. **Dec 12:** 2.5M shares borrowed for concentrated selling = only -9.8% move, held $3.90 support # SECTION 3: THE ASYMMETRY This is the important part. **Buying pressure and selling pressure don't have equal impact right now.** **Why selling is becoming less effective:** |Factor|Status| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Borrow inventory remaining|**500K** (down from 3.2M)| |% of ammo used|**84% depleted**| |Support level|$3.90 defended twice| |Natural sellers|None visible (insiders accumulating)| **Why buying is becoming more effective:** |Factor|Status| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Shares available to absorb buying|Limited (thin float)| |Gamma ramp|Max concentration at $5 strike| |Options expiration|Dec 19 (6 days)| |T+35 settlement window|Dec 16-18| # SECTION 4: THE VOLUME MATH Let's look at what different volume levels have historically done: **Normal conditions (no squeeze setup):** |Net Buying Volume|Typical Impact| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |100K shares|\\+0.5-1.0%| |250K shares|\\+1.0-2.0%| |500K shares|\\+2.0-4.0%| |1M shares|\\+4.0-7.0%| **Current conditions (squeeze setup active):** |Net Buying Volume|Estimated Impact|Why Different| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |100K shares|\\+1.0-2.0%|Limited short ammo to counter| |250K shares|\\+2.5-5.0%|Delta hedging kicks in| |500K shares|\\+5.0-10.0%|Approaches $5 gamma zone| |1M shares|\\+10-20%+|Potential cascade trigger| **The multiplier effect:** Once price approaches $5, market makers holding short calls must hedge by buying shares. This creates a feedback loop: Price rises → MM buys to hedge → Price rises more → MM buys more → Repeat At the $5 strike, there are **3,476 interest calls** with **0.36 gamma**. That's significant hedging pressure waiting to activate. # SECTION 5: THE SUPPLY SIDE **Who's NOT selling:** |Holder|Shares|Why They Won't Sell| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |McCann Family (Class B)|\\~27M|Family business, never sell| |Insiders|133K just granted|Accumulating, not dumping| |Fund 1 Investments|\\~5.4M|Buying back after Oct sale| |Long institutions|\\~20M+|Passive holders| **Estimated real tradeable float:** 10-15M shares **Current short interest as % of tradeable float:** 63-94% # SECTION 6: THE BORROW SITUATION This is real-time data from Fintel and iBorrowDesk: |Date/Time|Available|Fee|Change| |:-|:-|:-|:-| || ||||| ||||| |Dec 11 AM|3,000,000|2.94%|\\-| |Dec 11 PM|3,100,000|2.94%|\\+100K| |Dec 12 8 AM|3,200,000|2.94%|\\+100K| |Dec 12 12 PM|600,000|2.96%|**-2,600,000**| |Dec 12 4 PM|650,000|2.96%|\\+50K| |Dec 12 7 PM|600,000|2.96%|\\-50K| |**Dec 13 2 AM**|**500,000**|**2.96%**|**-100K**| **What this means:** Shorts borrowed 2.6M shares on Thursday and couldn't push price below $3.90. Then **someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday** \\- on a weekend, ahead of Monday. That's not normal hedging. That's someone loading up for Monday. For context, **500K shares is less than one day's average volume.** If buying pressure exceeds their remaining ammo, they have no way to suppress the price. # SECTION 7: WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK **Converging factors Dec 16-19:** |Date|Event|Implication| |:-|:-|:-| || |||| |||| |Dec 16-18|T+35 settlement window|FTDs from Nov must settle| |Dec 19|Options expiration|Max gamma at $5, all Dec calls expire| |All week|Low borrow inventory|Limited short suppression ability| **The math on T+35:** High volume days in early November (Nov 11-13) hit their T+35 settlement deadline Dec 16-18. Any failures to deliver from those days must be resolved, which means forced buying. # SECTION 8: PUTTING IT TOGETHER **Current state:** * 9.4M shares short * **500K available to borrow** * **18.8x imbalance** * $3.90 support held * Gamma ramp at $5 * 6 days to expiration **The squeeze trigger math:** To push from current price (\\~$3.90) to the $5 gamma zone requires \\~28% move. Based on last week's data: * Dec 9 saw +33% on 6.3M volume * But most of that was spread throughout the day **Concentrated buying is more effective than dispersed buying.** Dec 12 showed us shorts can throw 2.5M shares at it in a concentrated attack and only move it 9%. The inverse should also be true - concentrated buying into limited supply creates outsized moves. # SECTION 9: WHAT THIS POST ISN'T I'm not telling anyone to buy anything. I'm not coordinating anything. I'm presenting publicly available data and doing basic math. **What you do with this information is your own decision.** I hold a position (400 shares + calls) because I believe the math favors longs. You might look at the same data and disagree. That's fine. # SECTION 10: THE RISKS **Squeeze-specific risks:** |Risk|How It Affects The Squeeze| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |New borrow inventory appears|Shorts get more ammo| |Large holder dumps|Creates supply for shorts| |Price breaks $3.80 on volume|Support failure| |No buying materializes|Time decay kills options| |Shorts cover slowly in dark pools|Pressure release valve| **Fundamental risks:** FLWS does have real challenges: * $262M debt * Declining revenue (-11% YoY) * Recent quarterly losses **BUT here's why I'm also long-term bullish:** |Factor|Why It Matters| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |$1.7B revenue|Real business, real customers| |0.17x P/S ratio|Priced for bankruptcy (they're not bankrupt)| |$93M Adj. EBITDA (FY24)|Generating real cash from operations| |New leadership|First non-family CEO + new CMO + new CIO (AI focus)| |10M+ customers|Retention engine (74% repeat revenue)| |Insider accumulation|SVP just granted 133K shares| **The way I see it:** |Scenario|Outcome| |:-|:-| || ||| ||| |Squeeze works|Big win| |Squeeze doesn't work|I own a $2B revenue company at all-time lows with new leadership executing a turnaround| |Bankruptcy|I lose (but they're generating EBITDA, so unlikely)| **Two out of three outcomes are favorable.** The squeeze is the catalyst, but the valuation is the margin of safety. This isn't just a trade - it's asymmetric risk/reward with a long-term floor. # SECTION 11: SOURCES All data is publicly verifiable: 1. **Short Interest:** [ 2. **Borrow Availability:** [ 3. **Borrow Availability (alternate):** [ 4. **Options Chain:** [ 5. **Price/Volume:** [ 6. **Insider Filings:** SEC EDGAR # MY POSITION Full transparency: 400 shares + 174 calls (Dec 19 expiry) Total cost basis: \\~$4,900 **My plan:** The calls are my squeeze lottery ticket. The shares are my long-term position. If the squeeze doesn't materialize, I'll be adding to shares and holding for the turnaround. At 0.17x sales with new leadership, I believe the floor is well above current prices. I'm biased. Do your own research. **DISCLAIMER:** This is not financial advice. I am not a financial advisor. Options can expire worthless. You can lose 100% of your investment. Past price action does not guarantee future results. Do your own due diligence.",

      "selftext_processed": "FLWS The Liquidity Math What Actually Moves This Stock TLDR FLWS has a mechanical squeeze setup with verifiable numbers . 9.4M shares short vs only 500K available to borrow 18.8x imbalance . Shorts used 84 % of their ammo and someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday . But this isnt just a squeeze play its a $ 1.7B revenue company trading at 0.17x sales $ 285M market cap . Thats priced for bankruptcy but theyre generating $ 93M EBITDA with new leadership first nonfamily CEO AIfocused CIO . The squeeze is the catalyst . The valuation is the floor .

Dec 9 6.3M volume 11x average 33 % move 2 . Dec 12 2.5M shares borrowed for concentrated selling only 9.8 % move held $ 3.90 support SECTION 3 THE ASYMMETRY This is the important part . Buying pressure and selling pressure dont have equal impact right now . Why selling is becoming less effective FactorStatus Borrow inventory remaining500K down from 3.2M % of ammo used84 % depleted Support level $ 3.90 defended twice Natural sellersNone visible insiders accumulating Why buying is becoming more effective FactorStatus Shares available to absorb buyingLimited thin float Gamma rampMax concentration at $ 5 strike Options expirationDec 19 6 days T35 settlement windowDec 1618 SECTION 4 THE VOLUME MATH Lets look at what different volume levels have historically done Normal conditions no squeeze setup Net Buying VolumeTypical Impact 100K shares0.51.0 % 250K shares1.02.0 % 500K shares2.04.0 % 1M shares4.07.0 % Current conditions squeeze setup active Net Buying VolumeEstimated ImpactWhy Different 100K shares1.02.0 % Limited short ammo to counter 250K shares2.55.0 % Delta hedging kicks in 500K shares5.010.0 % Approaches $ 5 gamma zone 1M shares1020 % Potential cascade trigger The multiplier effect Once price approaches $ 5 market makers holding short calls must hedge by buying shares . This creates a feedback loop Price rises → MM buys to hedge → Price rises more → MM buys more → Repeat At the $ 5 strike there are 3476 interest calls with 0.36 gamma . Thats significant hedging pressure waiting to activate .

Then someone borrowed another 100K shares overnight Saturday on a weekend ahead of Monday . Thats not_normal hedging . Thats someone loading up for Monday . For context 500K shares is less than one days average volume . If buying pressure exceeds their remaining ammo they have no_way to suppress the price . SECTION 7 WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WEEK Converging factors Dec 1619 DateEventImplication Dec 1618T35 settlement windowFTDs from Nov must settle Dec 19Options expirationMax gamma at $ 5 all Dec calls expire All weekLow borrow inventoryLimited short suppression ability The math on T35 High volume days in early November Nov 1113 hit their T35 settlement deadline Dec 1618 . Any failures to deliver from those days must be resolved which means forced buying . SECTION 8 PUTTING IT TOGETHER Current state 9.4M shares short 500K available to borrow 18.8x imbalance $ 3.90 support held Gamma ramp at $ 5 6 days to expiration The squeeze trigger math To push from current price $ 3.90 to the $ 5 gamma zone requires 28 % move . Based on last weeks data Dec 9 saw 33 % on 6.3M volume But most of that was spread throughout the day Concentrated buying is more effective than dispersed buying . Dec 12 showed us shorts can throw 2.5M shares at it in a concentrated attack and only move it 9 % . The inverse should also be true concentrated buying into limited supply creates outsized moves .

Oracle has made several attempts to issue new bonds, but has failed in each attempt at $31 billion and $25 billion, grinding its data center projects to a complete halt. Edit: Bloomberg corrected the article to say several not seven failed attempts. They had 3 offerings in early November that quietly went nowhere…. [ [ \"Recently issued investment-grade bonds from Oracle are trading more like high-yield (junk) debt. For example, a note maturing in 2035 had a yield of around 5.9%, higher than the 5.69% average for bonds in the highest tier of junk territory (BB grade). Oracle’s credit risk is rising fast as its $300 billion AI contracts and massive cloud build-out push debt above $100 billion and toward 4x EBITDA. Free cash flow is still negative. Moody’s rates Oracle at Baa2 with a negative outlook, citing leverage and counterparty risk tied to OpenAI. S&P holds BBB with a negative outlook and warns spending could drag ratings near BBB-. Barclays cut Oracle to underweight, expecting pressure toward junk territory. Bond yields are climbing.\"",

      "selftext": "I guess the question is when to dip in. With price targets for 2026, averaging $458, that is a ton of gain potential with the after hours close Friday of $357.20. My belief is the constant chatter by low brows of an “AI bubble,” on a few platforms, is changing market psychology. It’s anyone’s guess as to when that might turn the corner from fear to greed again. The last time AVGO dipped substantially was tariff week. I picked up 1,200 shares for about $155. I’ve stayed long since and make a steady income selling calls. Another buying opportunity?: This Friday, I used the dip to boost up a position in Vertiv Holdings. The last lot I got for $160.20. If that were to continue Monday, I would buy more. With a peg ratio of 1.3, and a 5 year growth rate projected to be 30+%, I can’t understand how Wolfe Research reduced VRT to peer perform.",

My belief is the constant chatter by low brows of an “ AI bubble ” on a few platforms is changing market psychology . It ’ s anyone ’ s guess as to when that might turn the corner from fear to greed again . The last time AVGO dipped substantially was tariff week . I picked up 1200 shares for about $ 155 . I ’ ve stayed long since and make a steady income selling calls . Another buying opportunity This Friday I used the dip to boost up a position in Vertiv Holdings . The last lot I got for $ 160.20 . If that were to continue Monday I would buy more . With a peg ratio of 1.3 and a 5 year growth rate projected to be 30 % I can ’ t understand how Wolfe Research reduced VRT to peer perform ."

      "selftext": "TMUS, probably the most oversold large cap stock in the market. It consistently bounces off its 150 SMA - shown on a weekly chart here - where it finds itself once again. The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here: Sustained, above-consensus subscriber growth (volume engine): T-Mobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 (millions of net adds across postpaid phone, other and prepaid from acquisitions), with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press. Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue, ARPU stability/upside, and superior churn economics vs. peers. This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows. ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains: T-Mobile built a broad mid-band 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger; that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage + performance, especially for price-sensitive consumers and suburban/rural areas. Faster, cheaper 5G motivates upgrades (premium plans, 5G broadband) and supports new services (fixed 5G broadband, enterprise customers). Company commentary and analysts emphasize its network-driven wins. Diversifying revenue: broadband & fiber tuck-ins T-Mobile is not just phones — they’ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers (e.g., Metronet acquisitions) to scale fixed connectivity offerings. Owning both wireless and fiber/fixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value. ￼ Material free-cash-flow (FCF) tailwinds + aggressive capital returns: Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF; the company just authorized a large $14.6B shareholder return program (through 2026) and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors, supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion. Buybacks + dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return. ￼ Room for margin expansion (profit curve + operating leverage): As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex (once major 5G build is complete) and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers, EBITDA margins can improve. Market commentary and management’s guidance point to steady service revenue growth (high-margin) and improving profitability. ￼ Valuation gap + analyst upside: Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings / price targets in the $275–$280 range, suggesting \\~35–45% upside from current levels, supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns. If the market re-rates T-Mobile nearer to those comps, upside is substantial. ￼ Numbers that matter (evidence-backed): Record net adds / scale: company reported multi-million postpaid adds in Q3 2025 (e.g., 3,287,000 postpaid phone & other adds referenced in the release / press). These are eye-popping numbers that materially grow revenue base. ￼ Service revenue growth: management reported double-digit growth in postpaid service revenue and mid/high single-digit on overall service revenue in recent quarters. That’s a high-quality revenue stream. ￼ Shareholder returns: $14.6B authorized program through 2026 + dividend increase to $1.02 per quarter (recently declared), both compress available shares and increase yield/total return. ￼ Valuation framework & target: Base case (multiple expansion + FCF growth): If TMUS grows EBITDA modestly and continues buybacks that reduce share count \\~3–5% annually, the market could re-apply a telecom / growth multiple lift (say from mid-teens to low-20s on EV/EBITDA) as growth proves durable. That supports a move into the $250–$300 range over 12–24 months. (Analyst targets cluster near $275–$280.) ￼ Conservative case: Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → low-double-digit total return from current price (dividend + modest multiple expansion) — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow. Bull case: Continued share gains, ARPU stability, strong fiber/wireless bundling, and aggressive buybacks drive EPS substantially higher — stock re-rates to premium growth multiple → $300+ possible over 18–36 months.",

The fundamental case of why TMUS can meaningfully appreciate from here Sustained aboveconsensus subscriber growth volume engine TMobile reported record postpaid customer additions in 2025 millions of net adds across postpaid phone other and prepaid from acquisitions with large quarterly adds cited by the company and industry press . Strong net adds drive recurring service revenue ARPU stabilityupside and superior churn economics vs. peers . This growth is the primary revenue engine that will compound cash flows . ￼ 5G leadership and network scale that converts into share gains TMobile built a broad midband 5G footprint faster than peers after the Sprint merger that scale is translating to competitive advantage for coverage performance especially for pricesensitive consumers and suburbanrural areas . Faster cheaper 5G motivates upgrades premium plans 5G broadband and supports new services fixed 5G broadband enterprise customers . Company commentary and analysts emphasize its networkdriven wins . Diversifying revenue broadband fiber tuckins TMobile is not_just phones — they ’ ve added 5G broadband customers and have acquired fiber customers e.g . Metronet acquisitions to scale fixed connectivity offerings . Owning both wireless and fiberfixed broadband increases wallet share per household and improves lifetime value . ￼ Material freecashflow FCF tailwinds aggressive capital returns Management has increased guidance for EBITDA and FCF the company just authorized a large $ 14.6B shareholder return program through 2026 and raised its quarterly dividend — this both reduces share count and returns cash to investors supporting EPS growth and multiple expansion . Buybacks dividend increase are direct catalysts for total return . ￼ Room for margin expansion profit curve operating leverage As service revenue scales faster than incremental capex once major 5G build is complete and as fixed costs are spread over more subscribers EBITDA margins can improve . Market commentary and management ’ s guidance point to steady service revenue growth highmargin and improving profitability . ￼ Valuation gap analyst upside Recent analyst coverage still implies meaningful upside — examples include buy ratings price targets in the $ 275– $ 280 range suggesting 35–45 % upside from current levels supported by the fundamentals above and cash returns .

These are eyepopping numbers that materially grow revenue base . ￼ Service revenue growth management reported doubledigit growth in postpaid service revenue and midhigh singledigit on overall service revenue in recent quarters .

That supports a move into the $ 250– $ 300 range over 12–24 months . Analyst targets cluster near $ 275– $ 280 . ￼ Conservative case Execution slows but FCF and buybacks persist → lowdoubledigit total return from current price dividend modest multiple expansion — downside limited by cash returns and resilient wireless cash flow .

      "selftext": "So I’ve been investing on margin on Robinhood and my account is up like 70% all time (around $49k now). I honestly don’t know if I actually did something smart or if I just got lucky and the market carried me. I make around $10k a month so in theory I can handle drops and put more money in if things go bad, but I’m also pretty much fully using my margin right now so I know that could bite me if the market dips hard. I’m just trying to figure out a couple things: 1. Is it smart to keep using margin since I can afford to deal with dips, or should I back off before I get wrecked? 2. If I sell stuff I bought on margin, do I still get taxed on the gains the same way? (I think yes but not 100% sure.) 3. Anyone here actually use margin long term? How do you know when you’re using too much? Not trying to blow myself up but I also don’t wanna pull back too early if using some leverage is fine. Just curious what people who’ve been through this think.",

      "selftext": "There is a strong consensus right now for a \"Soft Landing.\" I wanted to stress-test this, so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections (Median Rate) and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies. I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced. **1. The \"Volcker\" Tail Risk (The Bear Case)** Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data, my model flagged a **\"Stagflation Shock\" scenario** with a **12% probability** (based on >2-sigma moves). * **The Trigger:** Core PCE re-accelerating to 4.5%+. * **The Historical Analog:** The **1979-1980 Volcker Pivot**. * **The Transmission Logic:** Usually, high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads. We see this happening in the \"Credit and housing transmission\" channel (mortgage rates cooling demand). **2. The \"Nominal\" Trap (The Bull Case)** However, Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal. It triggered a **\"Red Flag\" for Nominal vs. Real Divergence.** * **The Issue:** We are seeing a surge in nominal spend, but historically (2000-2020), hardware prices *fall* due to hedonic adjustments. The \"Real\" capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests. * **Concentration Risk:** The top 10 firms now account for **\\~40%** of this entire category. This isn't a broad recovery; it's a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates. **The Conclusion** We have a \"Two-Speed Economy.\" The Fed is hitting the brakes (Housing/Credit), but the \"Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration\" loop in Tech is hitting the gas. If that 12% Stagflation scenario plays out, the Fed can't cut. If they can't cut, the Tech valuation multiple (which assumes falling discount rates) is at risk. **Visuals:** I've attached the \"Shock Scenario\" and \"Red Flag\" cards below so you can see the risk breakdown. [* **Discussion:** Is anyone hedging for a 1979-style pivot? Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure?",

      "selftext_processed": "There is a strong consensus right now for a Soft Landing . I wanted to stresstest this so I pulled the latest Fed Economic Projections Median Rate and Tech Investment data to look for statistical anomalies . I found two massive divergences that suggest the risk is much higher than priced . 1 . The Volcker Tail Risk The Bear Case Looking at the tail risks in the Fed Funds Rate data my model flagged a Stagflation Shock scenario with a 12 % probability based on 2sigma moves . The Trigger Core PCE reaccelerating to 4.5 % . The Historical Analog The 19791980 Volcker Pivot . The Transmission Logic Usually high rates tighten financial conditions via housing and credit spreads . We see this happening in the Credit and housing transmission channel mortgage rates cooling demand . 2 . The Nominal Trap The Bull Case However Tech Hardware Investment is completely ignoring this signal . It triggered a Red Flag for Nominal vs. Real Divergence . The Issue We are seeing a surge in nominal spend but historically 20002020 hardware prices fall due to hedonic adjustments . The Real capacity addition might be lower than the dollar amount suggests . Concentration Risk The top 10 firms now account for 40 % of this entire category . This isnt a broad recovery its a concentrated bet by hyperscalers that is insensitive to interest rates . The Conclusion We have a TwoSpeed Economy . The Fed is hitting the brakes HousingCredit but the Corporate profit margins → capex acceleration loop in Tech is hitting the gas . If that 12 % Stagflation scenario plays out the Fed cant cut . If they cant cut the Tech valuation multiple which assumes falling discount rates is at risk . Visuals Ive attached the Shock Scenario and Red Flag cards below so you can see the risk breakdown . Discussion Is anyone hedging for a 1979style pivot Or is the productivity gain from this capex enough to kill the inflation pressure"

      "selftext": "Currently SGOV has a 3.82% 30 day SEC yield. Since we just had a rate cut I expect that number to go down slightly over the next month. Looking into 2026, the consensus is that there is going to be at least 1 fed rate cut. High Yield Savings Accounts usually drop in the same way that the Fed funds rate drops. With one cut, that would bring top HYSAs to 3.25% APY. But, according to AI: Forecast for 91-day (3-month) Treasury yields shows: ~3.64% in Jan 2026 ~3.11% by Mar 2026 ~2.69% by Apr ~2.16% by Jun ~1.95% by Jul Does this mean we will be seeing SGOV yielding 2% by July even though the fed funds rate is stable with likely only one more cut? With typical savings accounts, they usually fall by the same percentage as the fed funds rate, but it appears that SGOV would fall by more than a percent more. Is that because unlike savings accounts, treasuries are tied to the yield curve?",

      "selftext": "I came across this today and saw that JPMorgan has increased its stake in PRS REIT up to 7.58% and it made me think of how it went from roughly 7.01% to 7.58%, and the filing is said to have came out because they crossed a reporting line, seeing at how Tradfi players adding to a housing focused REIT in this kind of market, made me think seriously on what actually they are seeing that the rest of us might not be seeing, Is it just the appeal of steady rental income or are they still seeing strength in the uk housing demand even with everything going on. And what really got my attention is the pace of the accumulation, because to me it doesnt look like speculative grab at all, it feels more like a slow and confident additions from a traditional institution that is sticking to what they know it works, looking like just the kind of those moves that usually reflects a deeper conviction even if it does not come out in the filing. On a side note, i realized alot of talks about how tradfi and crypto are trying to blend over time, now that bitget is trying to expand more into TradFi, so it made me curious what people here can say regarding that, because to me if exchanges start bringing more traditional financial options into their platforms i have these few questions that i would like to know, is that going to be useful for more tokenized assets? Better market data? Or is there something completely different? And I am genuinely interested to know what would make a TradFi meeting crypto setup worth using.",

And what really got my attention is the pace of the accumulation because to me it doesnt look like speculative grab at all it feels more like a slow and confident additions from a traditional institution that is sticking to what they know it works looking like just the kind of those moves that usually reflects a deeper conviction even if it does not_come out in the filing . On a side note i realized alot of talks about how tradfi and crypto are trying to blend over time now that bitget is trying to expand more into TradFi so it made me curious what people here can say regarding that because to me if exchanges start bringing more traditional financial options into their platforms i have these few questions that i would like to know is that going to be useful for more tokenized assets Better market data Or is there something completely different And I am genuinely interested to know what would make a TradFi meeting crypto setup worth using ."

      "title": "What if we redesigned the stock market from scratch to limit market maker power without killing liquidity? (Long read)",
      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “patch” today’s system. The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity. That power comes from continuous trading, speed advantages, spread control, and real-time visibility into order flow. If you remove any one of those, they adapt. So the question isn’t “how do we punish MMs,” it’s “how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they’re supposed to do.” Here’s what a cleaner, fairer market would actually look like mechanically. First, get rid of continuous time. Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds. All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price. This instantly kills latency arbitrage, quote stuffing, and microsecond front-running. Speed stops being a weapon. Price competition replaces reaction time. Second, make order intake blind during each batch. No visible book, no stop inference, no cancel-replace signaling. Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears. This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price. Third, crowd sets the price first. Market makers do not quote prices. They do not step ahead. The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent. Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in, and only at the already-determined clearing price. They act as buffers, not drivers. Fourth, change how MMs get paid. No spread capture. No pinning incentives. Instead, they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed, plus a volatility-adjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large. They are compensated for absorbing risk, not for slowing price discovery or farming chop. Fifth, hard caps on inventory and leverage. Market makers cannot accumulate directional exposure. They must neutralize inventory within defined windows. This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed. Sixth, separate and slow the options market structurally. Options clear in longer batches. Hedging references prior clears, not instant ticks. This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “max pain” dynamics that distort the underlying. Seventh, retail execution becomes predictable. Everyone in the batch gets the same price. Worst-case slippage is known in advance. Orders either fill cleanly or don’t fill at all. You still take risk, but you’re not punished for being slower than an algorithm. Finally, stress is handled honestly. When volatility spikes, batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen. Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes. Compared to today, the difference is stark. Right now, markets reward speed, opacity, leverage, and time-based exploitation. In this design, markets reward conviction, patience, and real supply-demand alignment. Market makers still exist, but their power is capped by architecture, not by trust or regulation. You don’t eliminate intermediaries. You remove their ability to dominate price. Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been thinking about this from first principles instead of trying to “ patch ” today ’ s system . The current market gives market makers far more influence than just providing liquidity . That power comes from continuous trading speed advantages spread control and realtime visibility into order flow . If you remove any one of those they adapt . So the question isn ’ t “ how do we punish MMs ” it ’ s “ how do we architect a market where they can only do the job they ’ re supposed to do. ” Here ’ s what a cleaner fairer market would actually look like mechanically . First get rid of continuous time . Replace it with short batch auctions every few seconds . All orders submitted during the interval clear at a single price . This instantly kills latency arbitrage quote stuffing and microsecond frontrunning . Speed stops being a weapon . Price competition replaces reaction time . Second make order intake blind during each batch . No_visible book no_stop inference no_cancelreplace signaling . Only aggregate imbalance exists internally until the batch clears . This removes psychological and informational exploitation while still allowing real supply and demand to determine price . Third crowd sets the price first . Market makers do not_quote prices . They do not_step ahead . The clearing price comes purely from matching public buy and sell intent . Only if there is leftover imbalance do MMs step in and only at the alreadydetermined clearing price . They act as buffers not_drivers . Fourth change how MMs get paid . No_spread capture . No_pinning incentives . Instead they receive a fixed liquidity fee per share absorbed plus a volatilityadjusted risk stipend when imbalances are large . They are compensated for absorbing risk not_for slowing price discovery or farming chop . Fifth hard caps on inventory and leverage . Market makers can not accumulate directional exposure . They must neutralize inventory within defined windows . This prevents them from quietly becoming hedge funds while still letting them stabilize the market when needed . Sixth separate and slow the options market structurally . Options clear in longer batches . Hedging references prior clears not_instant ticks . This dramatically reduces gamma pinning and “ max pain ” dynamics that distort the underlying . Seventh retail execution becomes predictable . Everyone in the batch gets the same price . Worstcase slippage is known in advance . Orders either fill cleanly or don ’ t fill at all . You still take risk but you ’ re not_punished for being slower than an algorithm . Finally stress is handled honestly . When volatility spikes batch intervals automatically widen and MM obligations loosen . Liquidity is allowed to thin in a controlled way instead of vanishing suddenly and causing flash crashes . Compared to today the difference is stark . Right now markets reward speed opacity leverage and timebased exploitation . In this design markets reward conviction patience and real supplydemand alignment . Market makers still exist but their power is capped by architecture not_by trust or regulation . You don ’ t eliminate intermediaries . You remove their ability to dominate price . Curious how people here would poke holes in this or improve it ."

We are conditioned to believe US equities always bounce back and keep compounding. But history shows that long flat or negative decades do happen even in major developed markets. Japan is the clearest example. From 1990 to 2010 the Nikkei 225 delivered an annualized return of about minus 4.5 percent. That was not a short downturn. It was two full decades where buy and hold did not work the way people expected. Apollo’s argument is largely valuation driven. When forward price to earnings ratios are elevated future returns tend to compress. The data shows a strong relationship between starting valuation and ten year outcomes and at current levels that math points toward very low returns. Thoughts??",

      "selftext": "Oracle (ORCL) has declined roughly 15% over the past two sessions despite reporting continued strength in cloud infrastructure growth. The market reaction appears less related to demand and more to capital intensity and timing. Oracle is investing heavily in AI-focused data center capacity to support customers such as OpenAI, Meta, and Nvidia. While backlog and bookings are strong, near-term free cash flow has turned negative as capital expenditures accelerate, and management has guided that meaningful returns may take several years to materialize. This raises a broader question about AI-related equities, particularly within the NASDAQ: * Is the market beginning to reprice AI investments based on cash flow timing rather than long-term demand? * Does Oracle represent a long-term opportunity once spending normalizes, or is the stock likely to remain range-bound until free cash flow improves? * More broadly, could this signal increased scrutiny across AI-heavy companies with elevated capital requirements? For those interested, here are two perspectives I found useful for context: * Barron’s discussion of Oracle’s balance sheet and credit risk - [Oracle Stock Slumps. Why Its ‘CDS’ Are Spooking Investors. - Barron's]( * Baptista Research's analysis outlining both the bullish and bearish cases for Oracle’s AI strategy - [ I am interested in how others here are thinking about AI exposure within the NASDAQ given recent price action and valuation levels.",

Leading Chinese tech companies including Alibaba (BABA) and ByteDance (BDNCE) have approached NVDA to discuss chip purchases and are expected to place large orders. However, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, that the Chinese government has yet to decide whether to allow these chips to be shipped to China. NVDA currently produces limited quantities of H200 chips, as it has prioritized developing its new Blackwell and Rubin chips. The Trump administration earlier this week approved sales of H200 chips to China, ending an export ban imposed over national security concerns. In return, NVDA is expected to provide the U.S. government with 25% of the chip sales revenue. Coinbase (COIN) plans to launch prediction markets and tokenized stock products, with the company set to release these offerings on December 17. Its tokenized stocks will be issued internally rather than through partners.",

Leading Chinese tech companies including Alibaba BABA and ByteDance BDNCE have approached NVDA to discuss chip purchases and are expected to place large orders . However Reuters reported citing sources familiar with the matter that the Chinese government has yet to decide whether to allow these chips to be shipped to China . NVDA currently produces limited quantities of H200 chips as it has prioritized developing its new Blackwell and Rubin chips . The Trump administration earlier this week approved sales of H200 chips to China ending an export ban imposed over national security concerns . In return NVDA is expected to provide the U.S. government with 25 % of the chip sales revenue . Coinbase COIN plans to launch prediction markets and tokenized stock products with the company set to release these offerings on December 17 . Its tokenized stocks will be issued internally rather than through partners ."

The stock still sold off, moving lower alongside other AI-linked names like Oracle and CoreWeave. The common theme seems to be AI infrastructure fatigue. Investors are starting to question how much near-term pain companies will absorb to build out massive AI capacity. In Broadcom’s case, analysts are pointing to margin pressure in the short term, driven by heavy spending on networking and infrastructure tied to AI demand. This wasn’t about Broadcom missing numbers it’s more about expectations resetting across the AI supply chain. After a long stretch where “AI exposure” was enough to support valuations, the market now wants to see clearer profitability timelines. Feels like we’re entering a phase where AI stocks still need to execute perfectly, not just promise growth. Curious if this is a temporary digestion phase or the start of a broader re-rating across AI infrastructure plays. Source:",

Revenue slightly missed expectations, and while the AI contract appears substantial, negative free cash flow and a sharp rise in CapEx prompted the market to vote with their feet. Both sides of the argument hold water now: Bullish view: Massive long term AI contract volume and stable commercial clients mean fundamentals remain intact. Bearish: Cash flow pressures are real, and short term valuations may continue to be suppressed. I'm now hesitating whether this dip warrants a small position. Do you see ORCL's pullback as an opportunity, or is this just the beginning of trouble?",

      "title": "AVGO's earnings exceeded expectations, so why did its stock price plummet? The hidden concerns behind the AI ​​boom.",
      "selftext": "AVGO's earnings report is out, showing revenue of $18 billion, a 28% increase, and net profit of $9.7 billion, a 39% increase. Both figures represent all-time highs, with AI chips being the absolute growth engine. EPS was a high $1.95, a 37% increase, and the gross profit margin was 68%. All the data significantly exceeded market expectations. However, the stock price performance was interesting, rising initially and then falling. It dropped 5% after hours yesterday. The reason is simple: the strong earnings report had already been priced into the market. AVGO's stock has already risen 80% this year, so today's earnings report was a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" situation. While there's a logic of buying expectations, that logic isn't working here. In other words, the future performance guidance is weak. Specifically, Broadcom currently has $73 billion in backlogged orders to be delivered over the next six quarters. The company's top five customers are Google, Anthropic, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Anthropic accounts for $21 billion of the unfulfilled orders, while OpenAI only accounts for $1 billion. The remaining orders, approximately $51 billion, come from Google and other major customers, averaging only $8.5 billion per quarter. However, the company's guidance for the next quarter is already $8.2 billion, meaning there will be almost no growth in the next five quarters. The market will certainly think that the next five quarters will be mediocre, and more importantly, what happens after these orders are fulfilled? It's rumored that Google, their largest customer, has already partnered with MediaTek, and their collaboration with Marvell is also continuing. In other words, Broadcom's ASIC moat is not very high, unlike Nvidia, which makes general-purpose chips. Another problem is that Broadcom warned that the gross profit margin in Q1 of fiscal year 2026 will shrink by 1% due to AI products. Although the AI ​​business is growing rapidly, the cost of investment is high. This focus on scale rather than profit has become a key concern for the market, and it also raises concerns about whether the $73 billion in orders can be delivered on time, given the significant challenges in AI chip production and supply chain management, and the high concentration of major customers, with Anthropic alone contributing $21 billion in orders. The dependence is too high. The market demands both better-than-expected growth and guaranteed profits, but Broadcom only delivered on half of that, with the other half being completely uncertain. During the conference call, it was revealed that Google will become a key customer, while Broadcom stated that it doesn't expect significant revenue from OpenAI, a key player in the AI ​​technology chain. Following the earnings report, the stock price has already fallen by over 10%. Broadcom's AI business undoubtedly has explosive potential, but the key question the market is asking is whether they have the capacity to deliver on this surge in demand. What are your thoughts?

Both figures represent alltime highs with AI chips being the absolute growth engine . EPS was a high $ 1.95 a 37 % increase and the gross profit margin was 68 % . All the data significantly exceeded market expectations . However the stock price performance was interesting rising initially and then falling . It dropped 5 % after hours yesterday . The reason is simple the strong earnings report had already been priced into the market . AVGOs stock has already risen 80 % this year so todays earnings report was a buy the rumor sell the news situation . While theres a logic of buying expectations that logic isnt working here . In other words the future performance guidance is weak . Specifically Broadcom currently has $ 73 billion in backlogged orders to be delivered over the next six quarters . The companys top five customers are Google Anthropic Meta Microsoft and OpenAI . Anthropic accounts for $ 21 billion of the unfulfilled orders while OpenAI only accounts for $ 1 billion . The remaining orders approximately $ 51 billion come from Google and other major customers averaging only $ 8.5 billion per quarter . However the companys guidance for the next quarter is already $ 8.2 billion meaning there will be almost no_growth in the next five quarters . The market will certainly think that the next five quarters will be mediocre and more importantly what happens after these orders are fulfilled Its rumored that Google their largest customer has already partnered with MediaTek and their collaboration with Marvell is also continuing . In other words Broadcoms ASIC moat is not_very high unlike Nvidia which makes generalpurpose chips . Another problem is that Broadcom warned that the gross profit margin in Q1 of fiscal year 2026 will shrink by 1 % due to AI products . Although the AI ​​business is growing rapidly the cost of investment is high . This focus on scale rather than profit has become a key concern for the market and it also raises concerns about whether the $ 73 billion in orders can be delivered on time given the significant challenges in AI chip production and supply chain management and the high concentration of major customers with Anthropic alone contributing $ 21 billion in orders . The dependence is too high . The market demands both betterthanexpected growth and guaranteed profits but Broadcom only delivered on half of that with the other half being completely uncertain . During the conference call it was revealed that Google will become a key customer while Broadcom stated that it doesnt expect significant revenue from OpenAI a key player in the AI ​​technology chain . Following the earnings report the stock price has already fallen by over 10 % . Broadcoms AI business undoubtedly has explosive potential but the key question the market is asking is whether they have the capacity to deliver on this surge in demand . What are your thoughts Discuss in the comments section ."

      "selftext": "Rivian grabbed attention this week after hosting its first Autonomy and AI Day in Palo Alto. The company outlined an aggressive push into in-house tech: a custom chip, a redesigned software stack, new autonomy features, and even an AI assistant planned for future vehicles. Analysts liked the vision especially Rivian’s attempt to reduce reliance on third-party suppliers and control more of its hardware and software pipeline. But they also pointed to the same issues that have dogged the company all year: demand is still uneven, the path to profitability is long, and Rivian will need far more capital to fund both autonomy development and its next-generation vehicles.The broader takeaway from Wall Street is that Rivian’s technology roadmap looks promising, but real execution pressure is building. AI features may help differentiate the brand, but they don’t solve the company’s core challenges involving sales, cash burn, and production scale. For now, Rivian’s message is clear it wants to be seen not just as an EV maker but as a full-stack tech company. Whether the market rewards that ambition in 2026 is still an open question. Sourve:",

      "selftext": "Global capital is already beginning to shift the US cut interest rates as expected by 25 basis points so one shoe has already dropped now we wait for the other one and the other shoe is Japan According to the information released so far next week around the 18th to 19th the Bank of Japan will very likely announce a rate hike after 30 years they may finally raise rates above 0 point 5 percent to around 0 point 75 once Japan raises rates global capital flows will start to change and global assets will go through a new round of reallocation Why is that Japan has kept ultra low interest rates for decades so investors borrowed yen and moved the money into higher yielding US assets to earn the spread the yen carry trade at its peak reached around 5 trillion dollars but now the two countries are moving in opposite directions one cutting rates one raising them so the interest rate spread will quickly shrink or even disappear to avoid losses carry traders will rush to unwind selling US stocks US bonds and other dollar assets converting to yen and sending funds back to Japan We cannot predict long term trends but in the short term exchange rates will definitely swing sharply the dollar will weaken the yen will continue to strengthen and the US will almost certainly keep cutting rates next year according to their own statements current rates are still at the upper end of the neutral range meaning still a bit too high and very likely to be cut again in Q1 next year Morgan Stanley even predicts that by Q1 of 2026 USD JPY could fall to 140 a big move from the current level above 150 these currency swings will directly affect exports a weaker dollar boosts the competitiveness of US goods while a stronger yen makes Japanese goods more expensive increasing pressure on Japan’s export sector History may sound familiar in the 1980s this is how the US weakened Japans once dominant Made in Japan manufacturing of course that is a bit of a joke but the next asset likely to be hit hard is US Treasuries foreign investors hold about 35 percent of all outstanding Treasuries if carry trade funds exit the US there will be large scale selling prices will fall yields will rise and since Treasuries are the anchor of global asset pricing higher yields mean global risk free benchmark rates will rise pushing financing and debt issuance costs higher around the world Capital always seeks opportunity if it cannot earn carry here it will look elsewhere so investors will search for new safe haven or arbitrage opportunities leading to another round of major global asset reallocation That is the situation if you currently hold US dollars US Treasuries or yen denominated assets you can adjust accordingly but remember to hedge your risks and allocate in stages",

      "selftext": "Jerome Powell, the current Chairman of the Federal Reserve, has overseen a de facto restart of quantitative easing (QE) through the implementation of \"Reserve Management Purchases\" (RMPs) as of December 12, 2025. While the Fed has officially ceased quantitative tightening (QT) and avoids the term \"QE,\" these purchases of short-term Treasury bills have the effect of expanding the balance sheet and injecting liquidity into the financial system to address recent market strains. How QE Benefits Stocks: Lower Interest Rates: The central bank buys government bonds, increasing demand and pushing yields down; this makes fixed-income investments less attractive compared to stocks. Portfolio Rebalancing: Investors sell their bonds to the central bank and reinvest that money into stocks, increasing demand and prices. Economic Stimulus: QE aims to stimulate growth, leading companies to expand, borrow more cheaply, and potentially increase profits, which boosts stock valuations. Increased Liquidity: More money in the financial system encourages risk-taking, driving capital into equity markets.",

While the Fed has officially ceased quantitative tightening QT and avoids the term QE these purchases of shortterm Treasury bills have the effect of expanding the balance sheet and injecting liquidity into the financial system to address recent market strains . How QE Benefits Stocks Lower Interest Rates The central bank buys government bonds increasing demand and pushing yields down this makes fixedincome investments less attractive compared to stocks . Portfolio Rebalancing Investors sell their bonds to the central bank and reinvest that money into stocks increasing demand and prices . Economic Stimulus QE aims to stimulate growth leading companies to expand borrow more cheaply and potentially increase profits which boosts stock valuations . Increased Liquidity More money in the financial system encourages risktaking driving capital into equity markets ."

      "selftext": "The U.S. stock market is heading into 2026 with one major red flag: concentration. The “Magnificent 7” now make up 35–40% of the entire S&P 500, an unusually heavy weight for such a small group of companies. That level of dominance means broader index performance is being driven by just a handful of names, increasing downside risk if any of them stumble. Nick Ruder, CIO at Kathmere Capital, says that investors who want to stay in U.S. equities may need to rethink their approach. He points to equal-weight S&P 500 ETFs as an easy way to diversify exposure instead of letting mega-caps dictate portfolio direction. Ruder also emphasized something many investors overlooked this year: value investing. While most attention stayed glued to big tech, a number of strong value opportunities especially overseas delivered sizeable returns that many U.S.-focused investors completely missed. Heading into 2026, the takeaway seems pretty clear: concentration risk is high, and spreading out exposure may matter more than ever. Source:",

      "selftext_processed": "The U.S. stock market is heading into 2026 with one major red flag concentration . The “ Magnificent 7 ” now make up 35–40 % of the entire SP 500 an unusually heavy weight for such a small group of companies . That level of dominance means broader index performance is being driven by just a handful of names increasing downside risk if any of them stumble . Nick Ruder CIO at Kathmere Capital says that investors who want to stay in U.S. equities may need to rethink their approach . He points to equalweight SP 500 ETFs as an easy way to diversify exposure instead of letting megacaps dictate portfolio direction . Ruder also emphasized something many investors overlooked this year value investing . While most attention stayed glued to big tech a number of strong value opportunities especially overseas delivered sizeable returns that many U.S.focused investors completely missed . Heading into 2026 the takeaway seems pretty clear concentration risk is high and spreading out exposure may matter more than ever . Source"

      "selftext": "Following Oracle's revenue miss and sharp decline, Broadcomm Technologies previously a strong chip leader failed to lift its stock despite positive earnings, projected next quarter revenue doubling to $19.1 billion, and a dividend increase. Shares fell 5% in premarket trading. The company's disclosure of $73 billion in unfulfilled orders over the next six quarters sparked market concerns. As year end approaches, sector rotation accelerates, with AI concepts and tech stocks under pressure while value and cyclical stocks attract sustained capital inflows. Banks continue hitting new highs, emerging as the most stable and robust sector. Credit card stocks V/MA/AXP saw rating upgrades and rebounded sharply yesterday. Previously weak chemicals staged an oversold rebound, while retail stocks began catching up. Metals like copper, aluminum, lithium, gold, and silver rose in succession, with some industrial leaders also performing well. The Dow and small cap indices hit new all time highs. The S&P approached previous highs pre market, while the Nasdaq lagged behind. SPY will test resistance at the previous historical high of $690-$691 upon opening. A swift breakout above this level could signal further gains. If it falls below $687 within the first half hour, bears will gain the upper hand, prolonging the recent two week range bound pattern. $682 becomes the key support level for a potential downside test. Today's focus remains on whether yesterday's oversold tech leaders can sustain their rebounds. Key stocks like MSFT, ORCL, META, NVDA, and AMD must swiftly reclaim critical mid term resistance levels; failure to do so signals ongoing medium to long term corrections. Yesterday's sharp gains in credit card and chemical sector leaders appear unsustainable in the short term, making them key observation targets today. This represents my personal view and strategy for reference only.",

Following the Ukraine/Russia conflict it seems to me that the big weapons, tanks, jets and such are not as used as small cheaper arms.

The first company I am looking at is Olin Corporation . For the first time ever I am asking reddit about companies they know of for suggestions . My plan will be to take suggestions and then do my homework and then call a clairvoyant to approve my choices s. I am specifically looking for small arms manufacturers . Following the UkraineRussia conflict it seems to me that the big weapons tanks jets and such are not_as used as small cheaper arms . I couldnt find an ETF that focuses on smaller arms manufacturers . I feel like best case scenario in this world is countries stock pile a lot of smaller cheaper weapons . Worst case scenario is they use them ."

      "selftext": "Oracle shares drifted lower on Friday, continuing the pressure that started after the company missed revenue expectations earlier this week. The move isn’t isolated either several AI-linked names like Nvidia, Micron and CoreWeave also extended their declines, suggesting some broader cooling toward the sector. Investors seem to be stepping back a bit from the high-growth tech trade, at least temporarily, as questions around AI spending, enterprise demand and the sustainability of recent valuations continue to surface. Oracle’s weaker-than-expected cloud numbers added another layer of uncertainty, and the market appears to be digesting that slowly rather than reacting in one sharp move. Nothing dramatic in today’s price action, but it does feel like part of a larger pause across AI and infrastructure names after months of nonstop optimism. Source:",

I know a lot of finance firms don't allow their employees to trade individual stocks without permission because of insider knowledge, so wouldn't it be better to get a high paying job in another field, and then use your income to invest in stocks on your own, rather than spend your day job making money for other people and not being allowed to invest your salary?",

      "selftext": "Apple has felt “boring” for a while, but the setup going into 2026 is quietly getting a lot more interesting. Revenue is ticking back up, margins are improving, and earnings are growing much faster than most people realize. Nearly 20% YoY net-income growth for a company this size is no small thing. The services side is doing a lot of the heavy lifting. As Apple shifts more toward software and recurring revenue, the business becomes steadier and less reliant on big hardware cycles. That’s showing up in the fundamentals. And on the AI front: no, Apple isn’t trying to compete with Nvidia. Nvidia remains the king of AI for the foreseeable future. Apple’s edge is seamless integration, bringing on-device AI to its ecosystem in a way that just works. If the 2025 lineup delivers, 2026 could be the year it actually shows up in the numbers. It’s not a cheap stock, but for the first time in a while, the growth story looks healthier than the sentiment around it. 2026 might be the year Apple quietly surprises again not with a new phone, but with fundamentals lining up.",

      "title": "Panic Selling Psychology?",
      "selftext": "What do you think is more common - people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just can't intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed, overleveraged, nearing retirement, i.e. have actual *reasoning* for needing the money? I understand the latter, that part makes sense to me. You may very well *need* this money and are not willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle (i.e. push the retirement goalposts) to accommodate the current situation. Understood. But if you're not in that latter bucket, let's assume you don't *need* the money that you're pulling out of the market. No upcoming large purchases, no retirement on the near horizon, etc. So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate? Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now \"safe\" from further paper losses, even though they just guaranteed losses by selling? This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting - without logical/just reasoning for actually *needing* the money (highly subjective of course) is it not just 100% human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale? I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as \"what if this time it's different?\" and \"what if we enter a 15-year recession?\" Are the people who panic sell not proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts? I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel, after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L. Collins. I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is. It seems like 95% of it is man vs. himself. It's truly fascinating. Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their 'investing mind' who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash, and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically.",

      "selftext_processed": "What do you think is more common people panic selling because they see their paper losses and their mind just cant intuitively process it ... or people panic selling because they are overexposed overleveraged nearing retirement i.e . have actual reasoning for needing the money I understand the latter that part makes sense to me . You may very well need this money and are not_willing to be flexible with your current lifestyle i.e . push the retirement goalposts to accommodate the current situation . Understood . But if youre not_in that latter bucket lets assume you dont need the money that youre pulling out of the market . No_upcoming large purchases no_retirement on the near horizon etc . So what exactly are these people doing once they liquidate Watching it sit in a savings account knowing it is now safe from further paper losses even though they just guaranteed losses by selling This is the part of investing that I find extremely interesting without logicaljust reasoning for actually needing the money highly subjective of course is it not_just 100 % human psychology and fear of the unknown at that point which drives the panic sale I realize there are probably speculatory fears such as what if this time its different and what if we enter a 15year recession Are the people who panic sell not_proactively mentally prepared for those thoughts I am currently reading The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel after having just read The Simple Path to Wealth by J.L . Collins . I was a college Psychology major and the more involved I become with investing the more I am realizing just how psychological the whole thing really is . It seems like 95 % of it is man vs. himself . Its truly fascinating . Would love to hear from someone who had major confidence in the strength of their investing mind who was then truly tested by something like the 2008 crash and how you personally reacted both mentally and physically ."

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

I mean I was alive during the dot com and housing market bubble but I was just a kid (I'm 27 now). So those that have been in the work force for a while and experienced or seen the last big bubbles, what do you think will happen? I'm curious but also preparing for a backup since I'm in tech right now (IBM consulting). I'm already looking for other software roles but having serious difficulty like everyone else. My current \"backup\" is to switch to IT/Cyber like a help desk job. I have a BS in Mechanical Engineering but don't think I can get a job in that since it's been 5 years since I graduated.

      "title": "KRMN: The Pick-and-Shovel Space Play",
      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase, if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit, then KRMN is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= What fueled **KRMN's 189% run** since its IPO on February 13? # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum, and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit (*get it?*) # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that **positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond**. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and **national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( []( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN. Have a nice day. ================================= Shares, cost basis $58.99 And a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** (these are cheap risk, high reward, though!) because they were dirt cheap, and I know KRMN can move $7-10 in two or three days. However, the play is long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies to keep expanding activity into orbit then KRMN is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a company that sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . What fueled KRMNs 189 % run since its IPO on February 13 The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum and momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit get it 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day . Shares cost basis $ 58.99 And a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls these are cheap risk high reward though because they were dirt cheap and I know KRMN can move $ 710 in two or three days . However the play is longterm ."

      "selftext": "This probably somewhat of a hot take, and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off, but I've been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples... I understand that different investors have different goals, time horizons, risk appetites, but still. Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times, no matter what the economy is doing. We've been told that these stocks have steady demand, predictable revenue, and the cherry on top is the big dividend. Now it doesn't really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds. Consumers are tightening up on spending, there's tons of competition, and inflation is killing them. Input costs keep rising, prices keep going up for the consumer, and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices. When that happens, you either have to cut price or have your margins cut. Either way, not great for the stock or the business... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks: \\- $CL down 14.69% YTD \\- $PG down 15.19% YTD \\- $KVUE down 18.61% YTD \\- $KMB down 20.81% YTD \\- $CLX down 36.46% YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows, and even with the higher dividend yields, I’m struggling to see where the “protection” is supposed to come from. Most people holding these stocks probably aren’t expecting a ton of growth, but if you’re not buying them for growth, what are you buying them for? Maybe you own it for the dividend, but then what do you do in a year like this? At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing? If you're really looking for protection, or a hedge, why not just own gold? It's something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment. Maybe this all sounds \"toppy\" for me to say with the S&P close to all time highs. Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely, be a contrarian, buy these stocks, and wait for the rebound. However, I just don't really see the point right now. Please take all of this with a grain of salt as I'm in my late 20's and could be completely wrong.",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably somewhat of a hot take and I know it might piss dividend or value investors off but Ive been wondering why anyone still bothers holding the old school defensive stocks like consumer staples ... I understand that different investors have different goals time horizons risk appetites but still . Conventional wisdom says you hold these kinds of stocks to protect your portfolio and stay diversified through tough times no_matter what the economy is doing . Weve been told that these stocks have steady demand predictable revenue and the cherry on top is the big dividend . Now it doesnt really feel that way with many of these companies facing multiple headwinds . Consumers are tightening up on spending theres tons of competition and inflation is killing them . Input costs keep rising prices keep going up for the consumer and at some point they will stop paying those higher prices . When that happens you either have to cut price or have your margins cut . Either way not_great for the stock or the business ... Look at the YTD performance for some of these stocks $ CL down 14.69 % YTD $ PG down 15.19 % YTD $ KVUE down 18.61 % YTD $ KMB down 20.81 % YTD $ CLX down 36.46 % YTD Most of these names are sitting near their 52 week lows and even with the higher dividend yields I ’ m struggling to see where the “ protection ” is supposed to come from . Most people holding these stocks probably aren ’ t expecting a ton of growth but if you ’ re not_buying them for growth what are you buying them for Maybe you own it for the dividend but then what do you do in a year like this At what point are you just chasing yield and ignoring how the stock is actually performing If youre really looking for protection or a hedge why not_just own gold Its something that is defensive and will protect you in any environment . Maybe this all sounds toppy for me to say with the SP close to all time highs . Maybe the smart thing to do is fade this post entirely be a contrarian buy these stocks and wait for the rebound . However I just dont really see the point right now . Please take all of this with a grain of salt as Im in my late 20s and could be completely wrong ."

      "selftext": "Edit: I offer this example to counter the frequent reddit investment advise to \"buy and hold forever\", especially surrounding the Mag 7 stocks. Even Buffet who is a big advocate of long term market exposure has sold and rebought Coca-Cola multiple times. If you bought and held the \"Mag 7\" of 1985 and held to today you would have nearly no gains. The top 7 companies in 1985 were. 1. GM which rode up to the 90s in the early 90s, went bankrupt in the 2000s and still isnt at its all time high 30 years later. (This would have been a 100% loss of investment) 2. Exxon did okay, but not a massive gain. 3. IBM the only winner of the lot. 4. ATandT which went through an antitrust breakup and trades well below its ATH. ( 5. Dupont which didnt make any significant gains. 6. Ford which trades in the same range as 30 years ago. 7. General Electric which swan dove off a cliff from 1999 to 2021. (Lost 80% of its value in those 20 years). Essentially if you bought and held these stocks since 1985 you would probably be holding at a loss when adjusted for inflation.",

Even Buffet who is a big advocate of long term market exposure has sold and rebought CocaCola multiple times . If you bought and held the Mag 7 of 1985 and held to today you would have nearly no_gains . The top 7 companies in 1985 were . 1 . GM which rode up to the 90s in the early 90s went bankrupt in the 2000s and still isnt at its all time high 30 years later . This would have been a 100 % loss of investment 2 . Exxon did okay but not_a massive gain . 3 . IBM the only winner of the lot . 4 . ATandT which went through an antitrust breakup and trades well below its ATH . 5 . Dupont which didnt make any significant gains . 6 . Ford which trades in the same range as 30 years ago . 7 . General Electric which swan dove off a cliff from 1999 to 2021 . Lost 80 % of its value in those 20 years . Essentially if you bought and held these stocks since 1985 you would probably be holding at a loss when adjusted for inflation ."

Looking at the performance of the top holdings, it doesn’t seem that any of then had THAT bad of a day; some losers, but nothing huge from what I could see. Same with GSPK to a lesser extent; down 5% on the day while the general indexes didn’t get walloped that badly ( maybe Oracle contributed, but it’s not a top ten holding). What am I missing here? Not looking for critiques of the funds themselves right now, but wondering how one can go down 30% in a day while the stocks themselves didnt shit the bed all that bad. TIA",

The AI bubble is the same, except the fishtank has a leak. The AI bubble is worse. The bottom line is money, and the momentum of the USA economy is less discretionary money for an expanding portion of consumers. Who will buy those sweet red roses? \"Business is flush with cash,\" you say? How long? Robots? Competition has caused robots to drop in price. One million robots sold for $1000 is $1 billion. Not $1 trillion. It would take over four billion robots sold at $1000 to equal NVDA market cap. Chips are a component of that $1000. \"NVidia valuation if for data centers,\" you say? To serve who? Businesses selling ads? To who? The 1%? Do you see the math problem? So, let's consider two challenges coming. 1. AI bubble bursts. I have NVDA and INTC as short targets. 2. Japan carry trade unwind. I have TM as a safety hedge. So, my plan is to use gains from price declines in NVDA and INTC using put options to buy call options and shares in TM. The further upside is that TM has growth potential in its core business and as a Japan company it has stock price growth potential from a hyperinflated dollar. Thoughts?",

The AI bubble is the same except the fishtank has a leak . The AI bubble is worse . The bottom line is money and the momentum of the USA economy is less discretionary money for an expanding portion of consumers . Who will buy those sweet red roses Business is flush with cash you say How long Robots Competition has caused robots to drop in price . One million robots sold for $ 1000 is $ 1 billion . Not_ $ 1 trillion . It would take over four billion robots sold at $ 1000 to equal NVDA market cap . Chips are a component of that $ 1000 . NVidia valuation if for data centers you say To serve who Businesses selling ads To who The 1 % Do you see the math problem So lets consider two challenges coming . 1 . AI bubble bursts . I have NVDA and INTC as short targets . 2 . Japan carry trade unwind . I have TM as a safety hedge . So my plan is to use gains from price declines in NVDA and INTC using put options to buy call options and shares in TM . The further upside is that TM has growth potential in its core business and as a Japan company it has stock price growth potential from a hyperinflated dollar . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "\\>The order would create one federal regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \\>President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry, a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology. \\>Mr. Trump, who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I., has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations. He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws, and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology. \\>“It’s got to be one source,” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office. “You can’t go to 50 different sources.” \\>The president has increasingly embraced the A.I. industry, signing executive orders to limit regulation, provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology. He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I., including this week, and publicly praised the companies’ leaders. And he has given David Sacks, his A.I. and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor, heavy influence over policy decisions. \\> The order on Thursday, which has sparked broad, bipartisan opposition, is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws, legal experts said. \\>If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws, he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I. regulations, said Wes Hodges, the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. \\>“Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carve-out for Big Tech,” Mr. Hodges said. \\>New generative A.I. technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off. But the technology can be misused to trick consumers, and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors, among other issues. \\> States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I. safety, requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used. This year, all 50 states and territories introduced A.I. legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I. models, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini, to test for safety and to disclose the results. South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes, which are realistic A.I.-generated videos, in political advertisements within months of an election. Utah, Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I. chatbots and mental health, requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection. \\>States have also passed a growing number of child-safety regulations targeting A.I. chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.-based technologies. \\>“Blocking state laws regulating A.I. is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online,” said Sarah Gardner, the chief executive of Heat Initiative, a child safety group. “States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I. harms.” \\> A.I. companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations. Earlier this year, some lawmakers attempted to include a decade-long moratorium on state A.I. laws in the domestic policy bill, but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition. \\>“A 50-state patchwork is a startup killer,” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month.",

      "selftext_processed": "The order would create one federal regulatory framework for artificial intelligence Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office . President Trump signed an executive order on Thursday that aims to neuter state laws that place limits on the artificial intelligence industry a win for tech companies that have lobbied against regulation of the booming technology . Mr. Trump who has said it is important for America to dominate A.I . has criticized the state laws for generating a confusing patchwork of regulations . He said his order would create one federal regulatory framework that would override the state laws and added that it was critical to keep the United States ahead of China in a battle for leadership on the technology . “ It ’ s got to be one source ” Mr. Trump said to reporters in the Oval Office . “ You can ’ t go to 50 different sources. ” The president has increasingly embraced the A.I . industry signing executive orders to limit regulation provide access to federal data and make it easier for companies to build infrastructure to power the technology . He has also knocked down barriers to exporting chips that drive A.I . including this week and publicly praised the companies ’ leaders . And he has given David Sacks his A.I . and crypto czar and a Silicon Valley investor heavy influence over policy decisions . The order on Thursday which has sparked broad bipartisan opposition is likely to be challenged in court by states and consumer groups on the grounds that only Congress has the authority to override state laws legal experts said . If Mr. Trump succeeds in neutering state laws he should instead offer a robust national standard on A.I . regulations said Wes Hodges the acting director of the Center for Technology and the Human Person at the rightleaning Heritage Foundation . “ Doing so before establishing commensurate national protections is a carveout for Big Tech ” Mr. Hodges said . New generative A.I . technology that can imitate human writing and voices and create realistic videos and images has taken off . But the technology can be misused to trick consumers and chatbots have been documented offering harmful advice to minors among other issues . States have rushed to fill a void of federal regulation with their own laws on A.I . safety requiring certain safety measures from companies and putting guardrails around the way the technology can be used . This year all 50 states and territories introduced A.I . legislation and 38 states adopted about 100 laws according to the National Conference of State Legislatures . California and Colorado have passed laws that require the biggest A.I . models including OpenAI ’ s ChatGPT and Google ’ s Gemini to test for safety and to disclose the results . South Dakota passed a law banning deepfakes which are realistic A.I.generated videos in political advertisements within months of an election . Utah Illinois and Nevada passed laws related to A.I . chatbots and mental health requiring disclosures that users are engaging with chatbots and adding restrictions on data collection . States have also passed a growing number of childsafety regulations targeting A.I . chatbots and social media companies that use A.I.based technologies . “ Blocking state laws regulating A.I . is an unacceptable nightmare for parents and anyone who cares about protecting children online ” said Sarah Gardner the chief executive of Heat Initiative a child safety group . “ States have been the only effective line of defense against A.I . harms. ” A.I . companies have waged a fierce lobbying campaign in Congress and the White House to get rid of the state regulations . Earlier this year some lawmakers attempted to include a decadelong moratorium on state A.I . laws in the domestic policy bill but dropped the measure after strong bipartisan opposition . “ A 50state patchwork is a startup killer ” Marc Andreessen of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz posted on social media last month ."

The situation: I bought SCHD since I heard it was a good dividend option; the problem is, I didn't buy it in a tax-advantaged account (like a 401K or Roth IRA) and instead bought it in a regular brokerage account. Not the end of the world since it only has about $1K USD dedicated to it, but I heard essentially you just end up paying a lot of taxes on it. I also heard that you really want to try to hold on to stocks for at least a year to avoid higher tax rates, but would it be fine to sell off + tank the short-term cost + reinvest in a better stock of my choice?

      "selftext": "NFLX currently (94 something) is at about 28% lower than its ATH (133$). There is also the hope tthat the Warner Bros deal goes ahead as expected. In the past, I have been burnt by Reddit adage about \"failing stock, nobody uses it\" which had been proclaimed for Meta etc but everyone and their mom is addicted to instagram reels, facebook posts etc. (except for the self proclaimed Reddit intellectual elite of course). I missed the rally from 2021 onwards when Meta and other were at all time low. It seems like a very simple equation. **The more a brand people like and use frequently or obsessively, the more there is the possibility of it being higher priced in future**. I have seen this movie again and again since a decade. * AAPL - Apple stores are still full of folks and it just keeps on climbing despite no improvements in AI. People love it no matter what. * GOOG - Everyone is hooked on youtube and everyone has discovered their favorite subgenre/niche. The average watchtime on youtube keeps on increasing while networks and other formats suffer. Furthermore, the Gemini success with tensor chips will make Google most likely the AI leader * MSFT - This is a curious case. The majority of consumers use and like it because it is available at multi price points. But Corporations overwhelmingly dont have any other choice except to integrate the whole windows ecosystem including docs, teams etc. The common folks don't have any idea how integral windows and its services is to like maybe 90% of companies. * AMZN - Keeps on breaking records every year with Amazon retail and AWS also keeps growing. It has been said time and again that while GCP and Azure are playing catch up, it is simply not possible for many companies to just replace their years old AWS stack with other alternatives. AWS is here to stay and grow (although maybe not at the pace as earlier) * NFLX - With hopefully the WB catalog, this seems poised to be dominating households for a long long time. There is something there for everyone and anecdotal but yes I don't know a single friend or acquaintance who doesn't subscribe to Netflix. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext_processed": "NFLX currently 94 something is at about 28 % lower than its ATH 133 $ . There is also the hope tthat the Warner Bros deal goes ahead as expected . In the past I have been burnt by Reddit adage about failing stock nobody_uses it which had been proclaimed for Meta etc but everyone and their mom is addicted to instagram reels facebook posts etc . except for the self proclaimed Reddit intellectual elite of course . I missed the rally from 2021 onwards when Meta and other were at all time low . It seems like a very simple equation . The more a brand people like and use frequently or obsessively the more there is the possibility of it being higher priced in future . I have seen this movie again and again since a decade . AAPL Apple stores are still full of folks and it just keeps on climbing despite no_improvements in AI . People love it no_matter what . GOOG Everyone is hooked on youtube and everyone has discovered their favorite subgenreniche . The average watchtime on youtube keeps on increasing while networks and other formats suffer . Furthermore the Gemini success with tensor chips will make Google most likely the AI leader MSFT This is a curious case . The majority of consumers use and like it because it is available at multi price points . But Corporations overwhelmingly dont have any other choice except to integrate the whole windows ecosystem including docs teams etc . The common folks dont have any idea how integral windows and its services is to like maybe 90 % of companies . AMZN Keeps on breaking records every year with Amazon retail and AWS also keeps growing . It has been said time and again that while GCP and Azure are playing catch up it is simply not_possible for many companies to just replace their years old AWS stack with other alternatives . AWS is here to stay and grow although maybe not_at the pace as earlier NFLX With hopefully the WB catalog this seems poised to be dominating households for a long long time . There is something there for everyone and anecdotal but yes I dont know a single friend or acquaintance who doesnt subscribe to Netflix . What do you guys think"

      "selftext": "Costco on Thursday surpassed Wall Street’s quarterly expectations as its sales rose 8.2% year over year. The warehouse club does not share a full-year outlook. The company is expected to share more details about the quarter during an earnings call, which starts at 5 p.m. ET. Here’s how Costco did in its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: Earnings per share: $4.50 vs. $4.27 expected Revenue: $67.31 billion vs. $67.14 billion expected Costco has attracted new members and higher sales at its clubs and online as U.S. consumers across incomes seek value while shopping for groceries, household essentials, holiday gifts and more. Along with its warehouse club competitors, Costco has gained traction with younger customers who are signing up for memberships. Costco has also benefitted from a membership fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which took effect in September 2024, and kicked in as new members signed up or as existing customers’ renewed their annual memberships when they lapsed. In the three-month period that ended Nov. 23, Costco’s net income rose to $2 billion, or $4.50 per share, from $1.80 billion, or $4.04 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue increased to $67.31 billion from $62.15 billion in the year-ago quarter. Comparable sales, an industry metric that takes out the impact of one-time factors like store openings and closures, increased 5.9% in the U.S. and 6.4% across the globe. Digital sales jumped by 20.5% year over year. Source:",

      "selftext": "The Fed's interest rate cut was expected, and Oracle's ORCL earnings report dragged down US AI and major tech stocks. ORCL's continued high debt, persistently negative free cash flow, and ever-increasing costs turned what was actually a good earnings report into a negative, causing a sharp drop in after-hours trading yesterday and dragging down major tech stocks today. I'm not optimistic about Oracle's AI path; it will ultimately not become a partner in OpenAI. After all, with a deep-pocketed company like Microsoft at the helm, it's clearly not the best choice for OpenAI. AI is expensive, requiring even more electricity than Bitcoin and is more delicate to maintain. This relates to what I wrote yesterday about Tesla's potential energy storage, something I said I'd discuss later, but I'll address it now. Let's start by simply explaining why AI needs electricity, and a lot of it at that. AI operation mainly consists of two parts, each consuming a large amount of electricity: The first part is model training, a very energy-intensive process. For example, training GPT5 once requires a huge amount of computation, necessitating tens of thousands of GPUs/TPUs running simultaneously for weeks or months. These GPUs continuously consume electricity and generate heat, requiring cooling. The second part is model inference. Every time a user asks a question, the model parameters are read, mathematical calculations are performed, and an answer is generated, all requiring electricity. Each user dialogue may involve tens to hundreds of watts of computation. The enormous electricity consumption has caused global concerns about electricity supply in the face of AI. Since electricity is the foundation of AI, major tech companies are investing in and exploring renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, and tidal energy. I know that Google and Microsoft have invested in small nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion companies, respectively. Jensen Huang mentioned in a speech that the US may be filled with small nuclear companies in the future. So the conclusion is this: AI needs electricity, and the more powerful the AI, the more electricity it consumes. In fact, the future development speed of AI may depend on the power supply, rather than the algorithm itself. Having said all that, what more needs to be said about Tesla's energy storage? You should already understand my outlook on Tesla/Tesla energy storage; this is a subtle, understated approach. I often receive private messages asking about Tesla's prospects. If you don't understand an industry, don't invest in its stock. Of course, you might say you don't need to look at the financial statements; you can use the technical indicators (TA) for swing trading, which is another matter.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Feds interest rate cut was expected and Oracles ORCL earnings report dragged down US AI and major tech stocks . ORCLs continued high debt persistently negative free cash flow and everincreasing costs turned what was actually a good earnings report into a negative causing a sharp drop in afterhours trading yesterday and dragging down major tech stocks today . Im not_optimistic about Oracles AI path it will ultimately not_become a partner in OpenAI . After all with a deeppocketed company like Microsoft at the helm its clearly not_the best choice for OpenAI . AI is expensive requiring even more electricity than Bitcoin and is more delicate to maintain . This relates to what I wrote yesterday about Teslas potential energy storage something I said Id discuss later but Ill address it now . Lets start by simply explaining why AI needs electricity and a lot of it at that . AI operation mainly consists of two parts each consuming a large amount of electricity The first part is model training a very energyintensive process . For example training GPT5 once requires a huge amount of computation necessitating tens of thousands of GPUsTPUs running simultaneously for weeks or months . These GPUs continuously consume electricity and generate heat requiring cooling . The second part is model inference . Every time a user asks a question the model parameters are read mathematical calculations are performed and an answer is generated all requiring electricity . Each user dialogue may involve tens to hundreds of watts of computation . The enormous electricity consumption has caused global concerns about electricity supply in the face of AI . Since electricity is the foundation of AI major tech companies are investing in and exploring renewable energy sources such as solar wind geothermal and tidal energy . I know that Google and Microsoft have invested in small nuclear reactors and nuclear fusion companies respectively . Jensen Huang mentioned in a speech that the US may be filled with small nuclear companies in the future . So the conclusion is this AI needs electricity and the more powerful the AI the more electricity it consumes . In fact the future development speed of AI may depend on the power supply rather than the algorithm itself . Having said all that what more needs to be said about Teslas energy storage You should already understand my outlook on TeslaTesla energy storage this is a subtle understated approach . I often receive private messages asking about Teslas prospects . If you dont understand an industry dont invest in its stock . Of course you might say you dont need to look at the financial statements you can use the technical indicators TA for swing trading which is another matter ."

      "selftext": "Broadcom reported fourth-quarter results that beat expectations for earnings and revenue, and issued a strong forecast for the current quarter, driven by artificial intelligence demand. The stock rose 3% in extended trading on Thursday. Here's how the company did, compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG: Earnings per share: $1.95 adjusted vs. $1.86 estimated Revenue: $18.02 billion vs. $17.49 billion estimated Broadcom said revenue in the fiscal first quarter will be about $19.1 billion, which would represent 28% year-over-year growth, and is higher than the $18.3 billion average analyst estimate, according to LSEG. CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $8.2 billion, both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking. Net income climbed 97% to $8.51 billion, or $1.74 per share, from $4.32 billion, or 90 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Along with Nvidia, Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom. The company's stock price is up 75% so far in 2025, after doubling last year, as its custom chips, such as Google's tensor processing units, are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidia's graphics processing units. In June, Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips. In September, it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $10 billion order for custom chips, and separately, announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips. Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are on-track to buy and deploy custom chips. Broadcom's overall revenue grew 28% during the quarter, which the company attributed largely to a 74% increase in AI chip sales, which would be equivalent to $8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter. AI chip sales are reported in the company's semiconductor solutions business, which reported $11.07 billion in sales, up 22% on an annual basis, and topping StreetAccount's $10.77 billion estimate. Broadcom's other major segment, infrastructure software, reported 26% growth to $6.94 billion in sales, topping Wall Street's expectations. The segment includes sales from the company's VMWare offerings. Broadcom said that it would issue a per-share dividend of 65 cents, payable later this month, up from 59 cents.",

CEO Hock Tan said in a statement that Broadcom expects AI chip sales this quarter to double from a year earlier to $ 8.2 billion both from custom AI chips as well as semiconductors for AI networking . Net income climbed 97 % to $ 8.51 billion or $ 1.74 per share from $ 4.32 billion or 90 cents per share in the yearago period . Along with Nvidia Broadcom has been the other major winner among U.S. semiconductor companies due to the AI boom . The companys stock price is up 75 % so far in 2025 after doubling last year as its custom chips such as Googles tensor processing units are gaining increasing traction in the market as a rival to Nvidias graphics processing units . In June Broadcom said it had three customers and four prospects for its custom AI chips . In September it said it had a fourth mystery customer who had placed a $ 10 billion order for custom chips and separately announced a partnership with OpenAI in October to develop custom chips . Investors are closely watching to see Broadcom confirm that those companies are continuing to engage and are ontrack to buy and deploy custom chips . Broadcoms overall revenue grew 28 % during the quarter which the company attributed largely to a 74 % increase in AI chip sales which would be equivalent to $ 8.2 billion in AI revenue during the fourth quarter . AI chip sales are reported in the companys semiconductor solutions business which reported $ 11.07 billion in sales up 22 % on an annual basis and topping StreetAccounts $ 10.77 billion estimate . Broadcoms other major segment infrastructure software reported 26 % growth to $ 6.94 billion in sales topping Wall Streets expectations . The segment includes sales from the companys VMWare offerings . Broadcom said that it would issue a pershare dividend of 65 cents payable later this month up from 59 cents ."

I’ve read the IMF paper (link at bottom) and quite a few other articles, and understand that SRTs have been around since the late 90s and are a legitimate tool for banks to manage risk/improve ROE (and also get around those pesky regulatory burdens) My question for you all: Who has it right?

      "selftext": "Ok helping a friend out deciding something - this is in the USA. They currently have 100% equity in a rental house. Their purchase price was $132,000 plus around $65,000 worth of upgrades before it turned rental. Call it $200,000 even as their investment in this house. Rental house generates $2500/mo on average as a vacation rental. This does require some effort from him, but not a lot. Say 2-3 hours a week max to maintain the place and keep it ready for guests. Insurance is around $2000 a year, taxes are low. Since there's no mortgage, the only real costs are utilities (electric is very cheap) and insurance ($2000 a year). Taxes are cheap. So they are netting somewhere around $27-28,000 a year. Here's the thing we're trying to figure out: The house has appreciated greatly, from what we can tell, since they bought it 5 years back. Houses that are comparable in the area now sell in the $400,000's. He thinks they can get at least $400k for it, maybe more. There are already several people asking and two offers. This person is a decently learned trader who is up 50% this year on his investments. Their plan would be to take 2/3 of the money and put it in \"safe\" spots, ETF's, bonds, even just keep some in a HYS for a safety net. The other 1/3 would go in a family brokerage account to be used as more active trading capital. I do realize that the market has done great this year but this guy is also showing himself to be a decent trader who has had a few nice wins and is ahead overall since he started getting educated about it all. We figure that even at a very modest return per year of say 7%, that $400,000 would generate $28,000/yr ... is that not better to have the money working that way instead of having it tied up in a property? This property is definitely subject to fire and water issues (western USA) ... nothing yet but it feels very much in the cards. Insurance premiums are also skyrocketing as of late in the area. Is it a smart move to sell?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares of financial services company Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) fell 9.1% in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025, showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes. >The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37% from the previous month, while options and crypto trading fell by 28% and 12%, respectively. The number of funded customers also decreased, partly due to the removal of about 280,000 low-balance accounts. Adding to the pressure, Connecticut's Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a cease-and-desist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations. In response to the developments, analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock. >What Is The Market Telling Us >Robinhood’s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5% over the last year. In that context, today’s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business. >The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8% on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader. >The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto. This move marked Robinhood's entry into Southeast Asia's largest market, which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders. The expansion was part of the company's broader international growth strategy throughout 2025. The deals were subject to approval by Indonesia's Financial Services Authority, with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026. Investor reaction was optimistic, seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fast-growing market for both stock and crypto trading. >Robinhood is up 215% since the beginning of the year, but at $124.09 per share, it is still trading 18.6% below its 52-week high of $152.46 from October 2025. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Robinhood’s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $3,564.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares of financial services company Robinhood NASDAQHOOD fell 9.1 % in the morning session after the company reported weak operating data for November 2025 showing declines in funded customers and trading volumes . The report revealed that trading volumes for equities dropped by 37 % from the previous month while options and crypto trading fell by 28 % and 12 % respectively . The number of funded customers also decreased partly due to the removal of about 280000 lowbalance accounts . Adding to the pressure Connecticuts Department of Consumer Protection recently issued a ceaseanddesist order to Robinhood for allegedly conducting unlicensed online gambling operations . In response to the developments analysts at Bank of America Securities and Cantor Fitzgerald lowered their price forecasts on the stock . What Is The Market Telling Us Robinhood ’ s shares are extremely volatile and have had 60 moves greater than 5 % over the last year . In that context today ’ s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not_something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business . The previous big move we wrote about was 3 days ago when the stock gained 2.8 % on the news that the company announced its entry into the Indonesian market as it agreed to acquire a local brokerage and a digital asset trader . The U.S. retail brokerage entered into agreements to purchase PT Buana Capital Sekuritas and PT Pedagang Aset Kripto . This move marked Robinhoods entry into Southeast Asias largest market which has over 19 million capital market investors and 17 million crypto traders . The expansion was part of the companys broader international growth strategy throughout 2025 . The deals were subject to approval by Indonesias Financial Services Authority with the company stating completion was expected in the first half of 2026 . Investor reaction was optimistic seeing the move as a significant step to tap into a fastgrowing market for both stock and crypto trading . Robinhood is up 215 % since the beginning of the year but at $ 124.09 per share it is still trading 18.6 % below its 52week high of $ 152.46 from October 2025 . Investors who bought $ 1000 worth of Robinhood ’ s shares at the IPO in July 2021 would now be looking at an investment worth $ 3564 ."

      "title": "A deep dive into RKLB's backlog and burn rate: Is this stock the next SpaceX or a value trap? My in-depth valuation model.",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I've been following Rocket Lab (RKLB) for over two years. The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me re-evaluate the company's fundamentals. I've noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about \"To the Moon\" or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck, with few people actually sitting down to do the math. To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable, I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) valuation model based on their latest earnings call, backlog conversion rates, and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket. I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model, hoping to spark some rational discussion: 1. Space Systems is the real moat, not the launch business. Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight, but my data shows that RKLB's Space Systems division (solar panels, reactor wheels, etc.) is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business. The market seems to see RKLB merely as a \"smaller SpaceX,\" ignoring its potential as a \"prime of space infrastructure.\" My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months, as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate, the downside potential for the stock price is locked in. 2. Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face. I simulated three scenarios: Optimistic Scenario: Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025. Neutral Scenario: Technical delays occur, requiring additional financing. Pessimistic Scenario: A collapse similar to Astra's. In my \"neutral\" model, RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $300-500 million before 2026. This implies potential equity dilution. However, if they can secure a few specific government contracts (I've listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model), this gap will disappear. 3. Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking, some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions. This is often a bottoming signal, but it could also mean a multi-year consolidation phase. Conclusion and Discussion: Based on current price fluctuations, I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient. It's either severely undervalued (if Neutron delivers on time) or overvalued (if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored). Regarding my model data: This Excel model is very large, containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts, sensitivity analysis charts, and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins. Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format. However, I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions (Bear Case). If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data; or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast; or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions; please feel free to point this out in the comments, and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth. I'm curious about everyone's views on the actual impact of Neutron's delays on cash flow. Am I being too pessimistic?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone Ive been following Rocket Lab RKLB for over two years . The recent dramatic stock price fluctuations have made me reevaluate the companys fundamentals . Ive noticed that most discussions about RKLB on Reddit focus on emotional outbursts about To the Moon or the cult of personality surrounding Peter Beck with few people actually sitting down to do the math . To verify whether the current valuation is reasonable I spent two weeks building a very detailed DCF Discounted Cash Flow valuation model based on their latest earnings call backlog conversion rates and the potential launch cadence of the Neutron rocket . I want to share a few counterintuitive conclusions from the model hoping to spark some rational discussion 1 . Space Systems is the real moat not_the launch business . Everyone is focused on when Neutron will make its maiden flight but my data shows that RKLBs Space Systems division solar panels reactor wheels etc . is actually growing faster than the potential ceiling of the launch business . The market seems to see RKLB merely as a smaller SpaceX ignoring its potential as a prime of space infrastructure . My model shows that even if Neutron is delayed by 12 months as long as the space system maintains its current growth rate the downside potential for the stock price is locked in . 2 . Burn Rate and Dilution Risk This is the issue bulls least want to face . I simulated three scenarios Optimistic Scenario Neutron successfully commercializes in 2025 . Neutral Scenario Technical delays occur requiring additional financing . Pessimistic Scenario A collapse similar to Astras . In my neutral model RKLB may face a funding gap of approximately $ 300500 million before 2026 . This implies potential equity dilution . However if they can secure a few specific government contracts Ive listed the contract codes and projected amounts in the model this gap will disappear . 3 . Institutional Investor Movements I analyzed 13F filings from the past two quarters and found that while retail investors are panicking some institutions focused on deep tech are actually quietly increasing their positions . This is often a bottoming signal but it could also mean a multiyear consolidation phase . Conclusion and Discussion Based on current price fluctuations I believe market pricing is extremely inefficient . Its either severely undervalued if Neutron delivers on time or overvalued if the bottomless pit of capital expenditures is ignored . Regarding my model data This Excel model is very large containing detailed quarterly revenue forecasts sensitivity analysis charts and specific formulas for my assumptions regarding Neutron launch margins . Simply pasting it directly into a Reddit post would result in a messy and unreadable format . However I strongly encourage knowledgeable individuals to challenge my assumptions Bear Case . If you are interested in specific backlog conversion rate data or want to see my projected 2026 EBITDA forecast or want to run my Excel model against your own assumptions please feel free to point this out in the comments and we can discuss these specific figures in more depth . Im curious about everyones views on the actual impact of Neutrons delays on cash flow . Am I being too pessimistic"

      "selftext": "The Fed’s latest move makes it pretty clear which side of the mandate is getting more attention right now. At his press conference, Powell repeated several times that recent job growth may actually be negative once revisions come in. That’s a pretty notable shift in tone and it suggests the committee is getting increasingly worried about the labor market softening more than expected. With inflation cooling but not fully settled, the Fed is trying to walk a very narrow path. Wednesday’s rate cut was framed as part of that balancing act: easing enough to prevent further deterioration in employment, but not so much that they risk re-accelerating prices. How they manage this trade-off is likely going to define policy through 2026, especially if more data starts confirming labor weakness. The broader question now is whether the Fed thinks the economy can handle weaker job numbers without slipping into something more serious, or whether this is the first sign of a longer adjustment ahead.

At his press conference Powell repeated several times that recent job growth may actually be negative once revisions come in . That ’ s a pretty notable shift in tone and it suggests the committee is getting increasingly worried about the labor market softening more than expected . With inflation cooling but not_fully settled the Fed is trying to walk a very narrow path . Wednesday ’ s rate cut was framed as part of that balancing act easing enough to prevent further deterioration in employment but not_so much that they risk reaccelerating prices . How they manage this tradeoff is likely going to define policy through 2026 especially if more data starts confirming labor weakness . The broader question now is whether the Fed thinks the economy can handle weaker job numbers without slipping into something more serious or whether this is the first sign of a longer adjustment ahead .

      "selftext": "SpaceX’s path to a public listing got a little clearer after Elon Musk said the recent reports about a 2026 IPO are “accurate.” Several outlets had already noted that the company completed a secondary share sale valuing it near $800 billion, and the timing of that deal naturally fueled speculation about next steps. A public listing would mark a major shift for SpaceX, which has stayed private far longer than most companies of its scale. Investors have been watching closely to see when Musk might open the door to outside shareholders, but there are still plenty of questions about how a business built around long-term, capital-intensive projects will be received by the public markets. For now, nothing is formally announced, but Musk’s brief acknowledgment is the strongest signal yet that SpaceX is preparing for a transition that would reshape both the company and the broader space industry.

      "selftext": "Nvidia is seeing a wave of positive sentiment after analysts pointed out new export approvals for its H200 chips going to China. Bank of America reiterated its buy rating, while Wells Fargo flagged the significance of these approvals in maintaining Nvidia’s position in markets affected by U.S. China restrictions. Another interesting development is Nvidia’s new GPU tracking system, which appears designed to address ongoing geopolitical concerns about chip flows. It’s a reminder that Nvidia isn’t just selling hardware anymore it’s increasingly operating in a regulatory environment where transparency tools can influence policy decisions. Analysts continue to emphasize how central Nvidia chips are to China’s AI ambitions, even within tightened export rules. The market seems to recognize that despite restrictions, demand hasn’t evaporated it’s just getting reshaped. Given the volatility around chip export news lately, do you see this as a durable sentiment shift or just a short-term bounce?",

The company was hit with a $2.8 billion lawsuit accusing it of overcharging for cloud licenses something regulators have been raising questions about for years now. That overshadowed what should’ve been a positive update from Satya Nadella, who announced a sizable investment in India alongside deeper AI integration into Dynamics 365. Despite the broader tech sell-off, MSFT only dipped around 0.9%, which suggests investors are still placing more weight on long-term AI positioning than on the legal noise. But the lawsuit does highlight a recurring vulnerability for Microsoft: regulators and competitors regularly push back against its cloud pricing structure. The bigger strategic picture is that Microsoft continues doubling down on enterprise AI adoption, even as the regulatory environment gets tighter.

      "title": "Tesla gets hit with another downgrade as chip supply risks return into focus",
      "selftext": "Tesla’s latest downgrade from Morgan Stanley brings renewed attention to something the market hasn’t talked about much lately chip supply constraints. The bank cut its rating to Equal Weight while still raising the price target to $425, which is an interesting signal: analysts don’t see TSLA collapsing, but they’re also not confident enough about near-term execution to call it undervalued. The core issue seems to be lingering uncertainty around chip availability and delivery timelines, especially as Tesla tries to scale multiple initiatives at once (FSD, energy, robotics, manufacturing revamps). Even with projected growth, analysts appear cautious about whether Tesla can maintain delivery consistency heading into 2026. It’s another reminder that Tesla’s biggest challenges aren’t always demand-related sometimes the bottlenecks sit deeper in the supply chain. Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here. Is this just typical year-end conservatism from analysts, or something more structural?",

The bank cut its rating to Equal Weight while still raising the price target to $ 425 which is an interesting signal analysts don ’ t see TSLA collapsing but they ’ re also not_confident enough about nearterm execution to call it undervalued . The core issue seems to be lingering uncertainty around chip availability and delivery timelines especially as Tesla tries to scale multiple initiatives at once FSD energy robotics manufacturing revamps . Even with projected growth analysts appear cautious about whether Tesla can maintain delivery consistency heading into 2026 . It ’ s another reminder that Tesla ’ s biggest challenges aren ’ t always demandrelated sometimes the bottlenecks sit deeper in the supply chain . Would be interested to hear how others see the risk here . Is this just typical yearend conservatism from analysts or something more structural"

      "selftext": "Most of you have probably seen the report/highlights. For those who did not, TLDR: revenue slightly missed estimates, capex surged, resulting in negative FCF (-$10 billion). ORCL is -12.5% as I write these words, SP500 is flat. I wonder when the market starts paying attention to the AI capex problem (or is it a real problem at all?). It's a big question given the market's dependence on Mag7 and the AI story in general. At the same time, Fed has already decided to start buying shorter-term Treasury securities and is probably just one step away from a full QE. I wonder if QE makes investors forget about anything else so that the market can tolerate a few quarters of so-so reports (due to surging capex) from tech and keep testing new highs.",

I did some research and while it’s legal to hold onto the funds until the next year tax filing season, which is what the employer is doing, a safe Harbor basic match plan has to be 100% vested. I found my 401(k) contract and it states the same thing. I understand what 100% vested means in general. My question is, does vested only mean that the money is guaranteed to be mine (for whatever is earned of course) or does it have to be deposited into the account? Myself and any co-workers lose the opportunity for that money to grow for possibly almost a 16-17 months?",

I found my 401k contract and it states the same thing . I understand what 100 % vested means in general . My question is does vested only mean that the money is guaranteed to be mine for whatever is earned of course or does it have to be deposited into the account Myself and any coworkers lose the opportunity for that money to grow for possibly almost a 1617 months"

One thing that stood out to me: DeepSeek often ends up near the top, and people usually explain it as, *“well, the team has a quant trading background.”* What I found more interesting is how DeepSeek behaves when you look at its decisions over time: * **It doesn’t panic in broad selloffs.** When the whole market goes red, it doesn’t immediately dump everything. It often holds through the drop instead of selling right into the lows, so it’s still holding when prices recover. * **It leans toward stronger fundamentals rather than pure hype.** Over multiple episodes it tends to favor companies with more solid business profiles, instead of chasing whatever is moving the most that day. * **It adds gradually when “good” names get cheaper.** On sharp down days, it sometimes scales in slowly to higher‑quality names at lower prices, rather than joining the exit. Put together, the pattern looks less like an AI chasing volatility and more like a cautious, valuation‑aware portfolio manager with a fairly consistent way of handling risk.",

It's the difference between a real visionary company and a PowerPoint presentation. I'm looking for the next stocks with that kind of genuine 'Wow' factor. Of course, every second company claims to be visionary and exciting – but I am not talking about companies that claim this, but companies that actually are. I believe that exciting business concepts attract investors more than boring ideas, even if the latter might be fundamentally sound. Which companies are currently still relatively unknown, but exciting in the spirit of the companies mentioned above? In short, which companies get you excited when you think about them, make you jump out of your chair saying: \"Wow, that is so cool! I have to own the stock for that reason alone!\" Edit: \\- The companies should be led by reasonable people who are experts in their field. \\- The business should be easily understood, at least when it comes to their core enterprise: For example, everyone gets that RKLB is in the business of developing rockets. \\- Successes and failures should be visible and there shouldn't be lots of opportunities for make believe tactics. Take RKLB again: If a rocket launch goes well, everyone can see it. If a rocket launch fails, everyone can see it.",

Its the difference between a real visionary company and a PowerPoint presentation . Im looking for the next stocks with that kind of genuine Wow factor . Of course every second company claims to be visionary and exciting – but I am not_talking about companies that claim this but companies that actually are . I believe that exciting business concepts attract investors more than boring ideas even if the latter might be fundamentally sound . Which companies are currently still relatively unknown but exciting in the spirit of the companies mentioned above In short which companies get you excited when you think about them make you jump out of your chair saying Wow that is so cool I have to own the stock for that reason alone Edit The companies should be led by reasonable people who are experts in their field . The business should be easily understood at least when it comes to their core enterprise For example everyone gets that RKLB is in the business of developing rockets . Successes and failures should be visible and there shouldnt be lots of opportunities for make believe tactics . Take RKLB again If a rocket launch goes well everyone can see it . If a rocket launch fails everyone can see it ."

      "selftext": "I am a really confused about what ADR investing in China based stocks from within the US really is. My understanding is that a third party company opens an offshore account in a place like the Caymen Islands. So the investor is basically investing in the Caymen Islands partner who owns shares in the Chinese business. They then agree to share a portion of the shares or profits with the investors based on the amount invested. That is what I thought it was but then I see articles saying that the partner owns no shares and agrees to share profits. So isn't that the same thing a share of the profits based on shares of Chinese stocks sold? What is to prevent this third party partner in the Caymen Islands from keeping the profits for themselves, making up fake statements for clients or going bankrupt? Where is the protection? Who would an investor complain to?",

      "selftext": "Are we already living through another industrial-scale labor shift, or are the fears around AI way ahead of reality? That’s the debate resurfacing after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday that AI is “not a big part of the story” in the labor market right now even if it’s probably starting to play a role around the edges. Powell’s comments clash with what a lot of workers are feeling. Executives across tech, finance, media, and even manufacturing have been unusually open about how they expect AI to reshape job structures, cut headcount, or automate entire workflows. That messaging alone has created a sense of uncertainty, even if the actual economic data hasn’t yet shown large-scale displacement. Right now, most of the labor market slowdown seems tied to broader macro pressures cautious companies, weaker demand, and delayed hiring not directly to AI. But the fear that the next wave of automation could arrive faster than previous cycles is still very real for a lot of people. Curious where everyone here stands: Do you think Powell is right and AI’s impact is still small? Or are we underestimating how quickly AI is starting to reshape work behind the scenes? Source: [",

Analysts say the metal’s recent strength comes from its “dual identity”: it’s used heavily in industries like solar, electronics and EVs, while also serving as a store of value similar to gold. Market watchers told CNBC that both sides of the demand story are heating up at the same time industrial consumption is rising, and investors are increasing allocations to precious metals as economic uncertainty lingers. Some analysts even expect silver could move past $100 per ounce by the end of next year, though opinions are still divided on how sustainable the current pace is.

      "selftext_processed": "Spot silver crossed $ 62 per ounce on Wednesday marking a new record high . Analysts say the metal ’ s recent strength comes from its “ dual identity ” it ’ s used heavily in industries like solar electronics and EVs while also serving as a store of value similar to gold . Market watchers told CNBC that both sides of the demand story are heating up at the same time industrial consumption is rising and investors are increasing allocations to precious metals as economic uncertainty lingers . Some analysts even expect silver could move past $ 100 per ounce by the end of next year though opinions are still divided on how sustainable the current pace is . Curious how others here view silver at these levels is this just the start or are price forecasts getting ahead of fundamentals Source"

      "selftext": "On the spam midfield that is yahoo finance news feed I noticed yesterday that the majority on analysts see MSTR as a buy or strong buy and one of the price targets was over 700 dollars a share. To me it seems like a house of cards for several reasons. 1.) If bitcoin drops lower than their cost basis all they have done is spend billions on a bad asset. Like a REIT buying an apartment complex and finding it's all covered in black mold. 2.) Saylor is trying so hard to appear fearless it should be scaring people. If his playbook is to keep issuing new shares and diluting to buy more bitcoin as the price collapses he needs a new playbook. 3.) IMO the potential downward spiral of a company is much faster if the only product the company has is its share price. And if the driver for that share price is a super volatile asset that's on a huge losing streak. 4.) The preferred stock with absurd dividends seems like an overconfident bet vs. a sustainable business strategy. (pun intended) If the bull case is bitcoin ONLY goes up over the long term I can understand that. But crypto is not the S and P or gold and it's history is short enough I couldn't sleep at night if that was my only reason for holding MSTR. I'm am legitimately curious what I'm missing. This post is my effort to learn new things. I don't have any money on either side of this stock and honestly both sides scare me.",

I understand there's overlap/concentration in big cap tech, but I feel we're a little behind so I want a growth focus yet wanted to give it a value tilt. I expect the Mag 7/AI to correct but also have a healthy rebound and still do well over that time period. BMNR is my wildcard. Background: This is a traditional rollover IRA. I am rolling over $100k from a previous job into the account. I have positions in these funds now and have set the $100k to be automatically invested each week into FZROX, QQQM, and QUAL over the next year, so these will be the final allocations. I'm assuming the market will be a little volatile over the next year which is why I decided to DCA instead of just lump it in (I know some prefer to just lump sum but this strategy is not up for debate since this is what my wife prefers)",

I understand theres overlapconcentration in big cap tech but I feel were a little behind so I want a growth focus yet wanted to give it a value tilt . I expect the Mag 7AI to correct but also have a healthy rebound and still do well over that time period . BMNR is my wildcard . Background This is a traditional rollover IRA . I am rolling over $ 100k from a previous job into the account . I have positions in these funds now and have set the $ 100k to be automatically invested each week into FZROX QQQM and QUAL over the next year so these will be the final allocations . Im assuming the market will be a little volatile over the next year which is why I decided to DCA instead of just lump it in I know some prefer to just lump sum but this strategy is not_up for debate since this is what my wife prefers"

      "selftext": "I’m in my early 20s and have been working on a long-term investing plan as my income will likely rise over the next decade. I’d appreciate thoughts from more experienced investors on whether this framework makes sense. **Phase 1 (Years 1–3): Low income / early career** My goal in this stage is to build a base safely without taking big equity risks. Keeping around 80% in high-quality bond funds or debt-heavy multi-asset funds A small 20% SIP into equity index funds, flexicap, and some international exposure just to build discipline and not miss market growth completely Monthly contributions to a long-term government-backed savings plan Objective here: build a starting corpus steadily and protect capital rather than chase high returns **Phase 2 (Years 4–10): Mid-career, higher income** As income rises, I plan to shift towards equity assets, high growth, high risk Moving the early-career corpus more heavily into equity funds and some individual stocks (around 60% equity allocation) Remaining portion in bond funds, gold, and short-term liquidity instruments Increasing equity SIP amounts as income grows Using retirement-oriented or tax-advantaged accounts available in my country to improve efficiency Goal here: build long-term compounding and take advantage of higher risk capacity **Phase 3 (Years 10–15): Higher income / more stability** A more balanced 50:50 mix of equity and fixed-income, plus a small allocation to gold Beginning to add some very safe instruments as part of long-term planning Focus shifts to stability, planning for future goals, and gradually reducing portfolio volatility",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about how to properly measure whether I’m any good at this, beyond just looking at my portfolio balance going up or down. For context, over the last 5 years I’ve averaged 31.5% per year, holding around 20 stocks at any given time, split across two countries. I usually only have one “Magnificent 7” name at most, the rest is mostly mid- and small-caps. My average holding period is about 8 months, but I do adjust position sizes for risk management and take the occasional swing trade when it makes sense. My lowest low was -30% during 6 months. My framework is a mix of macro themes, cultural trends, and retail sentiment. Now, obviously those returns sound good on paper. But I also know survivorship bias, bull-market tailwinds, luck, volatility exposure, and concentrated bets can distort the picture. So I’m curious how you all think about benchmarking yourselves: - Do you compare everything to the S&P 500 or another major index? (I tend to compare myself vs Nasdaq US) - If you invest internationally, do you use blended benchmarks? - Do you adjust for risk, volatility, drawdowns, or turnover? - Is there a point where comparing to broad indices stops making sense if your style is very different? - And what time horizon is actually meaningful; 3 years? 5? 10? Basically: how do you know if you genuinely have skill, or if you’re just surfing a wave? I’d be really interested to hear how others approach this, especially those who don’t just buy index funds but also aren’t full-time traders.",

For context over the last 5 years I ’ ve averaged 31.5 % per year holding around 20 stocks at any given time split across two countries . I usually only have one “ Magnificent 7 ” name at most the rest is mostly mid and smallcaps . My average holding period is about 8 months but I do adjust position sizes for risk management and take the occasional swing trade when it makes sense . My lowest low was 30 % during 6 months . My framework is a mix of macro themes cultural trends and retail sentiment . Now obviously those returns sound good on paper . But I also know survivorship bias bullmarket tailwinds luck volatility exposure and concentrated bets can distort the picture . So I ’ m curious how you all think about benchmarking yourselves Do you compare everything to the SP 500 or another major index I tend to compare myself vs Nasdaq US If you invest internationally do you use blended benchmarks Do you adjust for risk volatility drawdowns or turnover Is there a point where comparing to broad indices stops making sense if your style is very different And what time horizon is actually meaningful 3 years 5 10 Basically how do you know if you genuinely have skill or if you ’ re just surfing a wave I ’ d be really interested to hear how others approach this especially those who don ’ t just buy index funds but also aren ’ t fulltime traders ."

I started researching option income strategies and the basic concept is just selling time decay instead of waiting for quarterly dividend payments so I spent 5 weeks paper trading before moving 20k from dividends to systematic credit spreads Results so far are pretty different, that 20k was generating about 50 bucks monthly in dividends but now it's generating 350 to 550 monthly selling weekly options, depending on the market conditions and how many trades hit targets, a massive income increase but obviously way more work and risk. What's interesting though is monthly consistency as dividends come quarterly but option premium comes weekly, sometimes daily so it feels more like actual income stream instead of waiting 3 months between payments, the psychological difference is bigger than I expected as well For people who shifted from dividend income to premium income, what percentage feels right? I am thinking maybe 30% in options max, keeping 70% in stable dividends but I'm curious what allocation others landed on after testing both approaches.",

      "selftext": "I am going through specifics of the scam because I know there are people that won't believe they're being scammed unless their scenario matches exactly and entirely. Here's the process 1. They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram, pretending to be another app. When you click on it, it asks you to message a whatsapp number. 2. There are 2 \"important\" people. One is the mentor and one is the advisor. The advisor always direct messages you, and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat. 3. The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around. it's to add legitimacy. 4. They will suggest you stocks. After you buy them, the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots. Q: Why do they ask you for screenshots? A: It's to make you accustomed to the process. They don't need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions. It's useless for them. Edit: following a comment - it's not exactly useless, it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if you're worth their time. The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock. They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut. 5. After 2 months regular stock recommendations. They will advertise and hype up their scam stock, promising 150% gains. They want you to put as much as possible. Just to add on, they don't specify the stock ticker until the last day (Dec 8). They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker, not the stock itself. 6. [chow stock - Google Search]( This was the specific scam stock recommended yesterday. It went up by 20% before dropping 85% today (Dec 10th). It's honestly impressive. 7. I've been too lazy to photoshop/html edit the transactions, so they're trying everything in their power to get me to send the evidence. Including calling me 15 times yesterday and promising a 80% cash back on the imaginary losses. (I told them i invested 100k)",

      "selftext_processed": "I am going through specifics of the scam because I know there are people that wont believe theyre being scammed unless their scenario matches exactly and entirely . Heres the process 1 . They advertise their scam group on a platform like instagram pretending to be another app . When you click on it it asks you to message a whatsapp number . 2 . There are 2 important people . One is the mentor and one is the advisor . The advisor always direct messages you and the mentor speaks AI summaries of stock events in the group chat . 3 . The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around . its to add legitimacy . 4 . They will suggest you stocks . After you buy them the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots . Q Why do they ask you for screenshots A Its to make you accustomed to the process . They dont need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions . Its useless for them . Edit following a comment its not_exactly useless it also lets them know how much you have and are willing to invest to see if youre worth their time . The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock . They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut . 5 . After 2 months regular stock recommendations . They will advertise and hype up their scam stock promising 150 % gains . They want you to put as much as possible . Just to add on they dont specify the stock ticker until the last day Dec 8 . They advertise the releasement of the stock ticker not_the stock itself . 6. chow stock Google Search This was the specific scam stock recommended yesterday . It went up by 20 % before dropping 85 % today Dec 10th . Its honestly impressive . 7 . Ive been too lazy to photoshophtml edit the transactions so theyre trying everything in their power to get me to send the evidence . Including calling me 15 times yesterday and promising a 80 % cash back on the imaginary losses . I told them i invested 100k"

      "selftext": "Hey All, TLDR: MT $70 target book value / fundamental value. Catalysts are huge technical breakout, perfect alignment of fundamentals, and possible gasoline on the fire if the Ukraine war ends, or possible announcements on rare earths like everybody else. They have a lot of mines. I have built a bit of a specialization in steel stocks. Caught the huge run in NUE in 21', the X buyout in '23, and again when it went through among some other trades. I thought I'd share my latest trade idea. Mittal Steel is the largest global steel company outside of China with operations globally. Weekly Chart: Massive breakout and trading at a 12 year high. Global profile in 2nd screen shot. General notes below. 1. MT 1. Target: $70 18X Long Run Earnings conservative, $70.75 Book Value 2. Q EPS Growth: 31.36% 255.75% (14.18%) 86.85% 3. Q REV Growth: 3.03% (1.99%) (9.11%) 1.11% 4. Next Q EPS: 31%, 9%, -5%, 61% 5. Next Q REV: 7%, 3% next two years 6. Catalysts: 7. Technicals 1. Technicals very strong. Trading at a decade high. Huge breakout 2. IWM huge long term breakout 3. Fed QE 4. Long hated stock 8. Fundamentals 1. Probably 2nd best run steel company globally after Steel Dynamics 2. Bought back almost 40% of shares in the last 5 years. Huge ongoing buybacks. 3. USA, EU, Canada Protections and more seem to be coming to keep China steel out. Everywhere MT operates is looking to protect their industry. 4. And over the last four years combined, capital spending amounted to $15.49 billion resulting in $1.9 billion in through cycle EBITDA coming (step change in profitability), Very Cheap, 5. M&A target (BHP, RIO, NUE?), 50% of FCF going to buying back shares. Nearly 40% in the last few years. Nice dividend. 6. China steel exports may or may not be sustainable. Iron ore prices rising. Massive China Stimulus + recovering market. 7. Number 1 global volume outside of China which everybody is putting tariffs on. 8. Trading 1/2 of Revenue, 63% of Book Value 9. Europe waking up. Massive German/Europe Stimulus. Global stimulus. Back to strength globally from trough? Europe Anti dumping cases. 22% USA Profits. 10. Drove at least $3-4 in value taking over Calvert a huge plant when the Nippon deal to acquire U.S. Steel went through. . Strongest price action of all steel companies. New market leader. 9. Catalysts 1. Massive Technical Breakout + Fundamental factors above. 2. If the Ukraine War Ends we will pop massively due to huge steel demand to rebuild. MT has extensive Ukraine and EU assets. 3. Any mention of rare earths it could rocket even if it is a gimmick. Positions",

      "selftext": "I stumbled on a chart comparing average annual returns from 1980–2015 for different assets, and it honestly surprised me. According to the data: • Birkin bags: 14.2% annual return • S&P 500: 9.8% annual return • S&P 500 (total returns): 12.7% • Gold: 3.4% The graphic claimed that Birkin bags on the secondary market actually beat both the S&P 500 and gold over that 35 year period. I know luxury goods can appreciate, but I didn’t realize Birkins historically outperformed major asset classes by that much. Obviously they’re not as liquid, and authentication/condition matters a lot, but still… pretty wild. What do you all think? Is investing in Birkins a legit strategy, or is this cherry picked data / survivorship bias? Anyone here actually invest in luxury handbags as part of their portfolio?",

I know luxury goods can appreciate but I didn ’ t realize Birkins historically outperformed major asset classes by that much . Obviously they ’ re not_as liquid and authenticationcondition matters a lot but still… pretty wild . What do you all think Is investing in Birkins a legit strategy or is this cherry picked data survivorship bias Anyone here actually invest in luxury handbags as part of their portfolio"

This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board. If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50%–3.75%, the Fed may be passively tightening, leading to a slower growth outlook. If the market believes the Fed is now neutral, it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress, or drop in inflation. * The bar for future rate cuts is now higher.

      "title": "Lyft -8% and Uber -7% as Waymo plans 1M weekly robotaxi rides and a major 2026 city expansion",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business. >Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.” >Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. >Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades. >Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses. >“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement. >That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD. >But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit. >“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Waymo Alphabet Inc. ’ s selfdriving tech unit expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan . It ’ s the first time that the company which started in 2009 as the Google SelfDriving Car project has set a hard target for its business . Currently the Mountain View Californiabased company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix Los Angeles San Francisco and Bay Area communities Austin Atlanta and as of last month Miami . That ’ s “ a number that we ’ re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026 ” Waymo said in a blog post . “ As we look to 2026 we ’ re laying the early groundwork for ridehailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026 including international cities like Tokyo and London. ” Waymo doesn ’ t share financial data but various estimates suggest it makes at least $ 20 per ride which adds up to more than $ 20 million a month . At 1 million rides per week its annualized revenue would hit about $ 1 billion a milestone for the earlystage robotaxi market . To handle that volume of rides the company ’ s fleet will likely expand to at least 10000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2500 now likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar IPace SUVs . Though the service has proved popular with riders Waymo ’ s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges . The company ’ s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco for example following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors . Last month a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street . Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company which hasn ’ t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans needs to make additional safety upgrades . Additionally Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses . “ While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better ” Mauricio Peña Waymo ’ s Waymos chief safety officer said in a statement . That said Waymo ’ s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space including General Motors ’ Cruise unit which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco . Tesla whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its socalled Full SelfDriving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use . Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it ’ s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD . But while Waymo ’ s safety issues so far haven ’ t been as serious some critics think it ’ s expanding too fast perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit . “ We are left to wonder why the world ’ s most experienced driver ’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience ” Phil Koopman an autonomous driving researcher and CarnegieMellon University professor said in a blog post . “ Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can ’ t shrug off . It ’ s unclear which will happen first ."

      "title": "2026 Stock Market Outlook: How Long Can the AI Hype Last Amid Policy Risks and Election Uncertainty?",
      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

Basically I’m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£, but this is in the case but let’s start on 250£. I have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 - VUAG, but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold.

      "selftext": "According to Axios & other financial media, at least 5 voting FOMC members have publicly stated in recent weeks they oppose lowering rates today (December 10, 2025), if not the foreseeable future until/unless inflation decelerates: [ However, financial markets expect a -0.25% move as a near-certainty. This means on paper, Powell would have to get all 7 remaining voters on board … or not. In practice, many FOMC members will blabber about their personal preferences in media interviews, but consistently side with the chair on the official recorded vote. Why they do this is not entirely clear: the FOMC prides itself in being an independent, consensus-minded organization, but has also been criticized for excessive groupthink. Also, with Powell’s chairmanship coming to an end, it’s not clear why so many FOMC members act like they owe some kind of allegiance to him. **So the truth is FOMC decision making lies somewhere between “one person, one independent vote” and “the chair dictates all policy decisions.”** Which brings the topic of discussion to next year’s leadership transition. Trump has stated in interviews he wants nominal rates below 1% (he’s repeated this specific number multiple times) and has made lowering rates his #1 litmus test in looking for a new chair. **But financial markets are currently pricing in ”only“ -0.50 to -0.75% of cuts in 2026.** lf the rumored front-runner Kevin Hassett (or whomever else Trump nominates) succeeds Powell, couldn’t he use the same powers of the position to force rates much lower?",

This means on paper Powell would have to get all 7 remaining voters on board … or not_In practice many FOMC members will blabber about their personal preferences in media interviews but consistently side with the chair on the official recorded vote . Why they do this is not_entirely clear the FOMC prides itself in being an independent consensusminded organization but has also been criticized for excessive groupthink . Also with Powell ’ s chairmanship coming to an end it ’ s not_clear why so many FOMC members act like they owe some kind of allegiance to him . So the truth is FOMC decision making lies somewhere between “ one person one independent vote ” and “ the chair dictates all policy decisions. ” Which brings the topic of discussion to next year ’ s leadership transition . Trump has stated in interviews he wants nominal rates below 1 % he ’ s repeated this specific number multiple times and has made lowering rates his 1 litmus test in looking for a new chair . But financial markets are currently pricing in ” only “ 0.50 to 0.75 % of cuts in 2026. lf the rumored frontrunner Kevin Hassett or whomever else Trump nominates succeeds Powell couldn ’ t he use the same powers of the position to force rates much lower"

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I kindly ask if anyone could give me their opinion on this splendid but suffering stock. I invested at the beginning of the year, so I am currently at a significant loss. I have averaged several times, bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC. At the moment, I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to: \\- hold the position \\- increase it \\- give up and take the loss. What are you doing? Looking at the company's financial statements over the last few years, I see stability and growth, so I don't understand why it has fallen almost 30% from its highs in such a short time. Please don't tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never played in that league, at least as far as the public is concerned. Many thanks in advance to everyone.",

I invested at the beginning of the year so I am currently at a significant loss . I have averaged several times bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC . At the moment I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to hold the position increase it give up and take the loss . What are you doing Looking at the companys financial statements over the last few years I see stability and growth so I dont understand why it has fallen almost 30 % from its highs in such a short time . Please dont tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never_played in that league at least as far as the public is concerned . Many thanks in advance to everyone ."
