The rolodex of choices like options, margins, leverage, covered calls, cash secured puts, CFDs, complex rebalancing, chasing the next hot stock, finding the next NVDA, the list goes on, all this are mostly rooted in greed, you want to beat the market and optimise for a few more percentage points, or just plain gamble for a big win. If you just do the work for 10-15 years and stay put, the rest of your life your wealth will compound by itself.

Looking to choose some new additions in 2026 and curious aside from keeping in growth mode or shifting to dividends slowly but surely. The breakdown I chalked up from various taxable / tax advantaged accounts, I have the following to mull over... * Taxable vs retirement: * 39% taxable * 61% retirement * Across all those, ratio of holding types: * 95% equities * 5% cash / treasuries Separate from that is emergency fund and primary residence. Let the critiquing / discussion begin (if this is not boring or out of suitable questions). Thx in advance!",

      "selftext": "Noted that this is anectdotal, but I was reading this article about California new rules for refunds. Somewhat interesting. [ Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you. At 7 p.m., we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late, and it will be 7:25 instead of 7:05. At 7:28, I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 7:15 still? So, I call the Dasher, they tell me that their tablet broke, no one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed. I text Doordash - no response ever. Then I call Doordash. I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund. I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesn't get picked up. The rep can't help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor. The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors, I'm 34th in line so I will get a call back. I ask when. They said it could be 2 hours. A company worth $100B market cap that has invested $billions in technology that cannot: manage a simple driver change, manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice, cannot manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours... This is systematic. Nothing works across their enterprise after billions spent. Of course, this is just my issue, but I've seen this before. This would never have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything. I know this is a vent, but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law, how others will follow, and if Dash has any management capability to improve. I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed. \"This happens all the time with Doordash\" were not the words an investor or customer would want to hear.",

Fast forward to tonight and we place an order at 6 p.m. mind you . At 7 p.m. we receive a text from Doordash saying it is late and it will be 725 instead of 705 . At 728 I click on the link and it says that it is scheduled for 715 still So I call the Dasher they tell me that their tablet broke no_one picked up my order and that they already told Doordash that another Dasher was needed . I text Doordash no_response ever . Then I call Doordash . I get to a rep who says I can file a request for refund . I should note that the restaurant closes at 8 and my food doesnt get picked up . The rep cant help so I tell the rep that I want to speak to a supervisor . The rep says there are a bunch of supervisors Im 34th in line so I will get a call back . I ask when . They said it could be 2 hours . A company worth $ 100B market cap that has invested $ billions in technology that can not manage a simple driver change manage to get a driver to a restuarant with 2 hours notice can not manage to have a supervisor respond to an issue within 2 hours ... This is systematic . Nothing_works across their enterprise after billions spent . Of course this is just my issue but Ive seen this before . This would never_have happened with Amazon or any other tech company worth anything . I know this is a vent but it really makes you wonder why California created their new law how others will follow and if Dash has any management capability to improve . I ended up speaking to the restaurant right before they closed . This happens all the time with Doordash were not_the words an investor or customer would want to hear ."

      "selftext": "I keep seeing people say “this feels just like the dot com bubble” whenever the NASDAQ comes up, and I get why. Prices are high, tech runs the show, and everyone’s talking about AI. But the reality today is very different than 2000, especially when you look under the hood. Back in the dot com bubble, a huge chunk of companies had no profits at all. A lot of them didn’t even have real products. They were valued based on clicks, website traffic, or just the idea that “the internet is the future.” When money got tighter, those companies had nothing to fall back on. They ran out of cash and went to zero. Today’s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money. Apple, Microsoft, Google, Nvidia, Meta, Amazon. These aren’t hype machines. They generate real profits every single quarter. Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then. Another big difference is how important tech is now. In 2000, tech was optional. Today it’s infrastructure. Cloud services, chips, software, and data centers run basically everything. Governments, hospitals, banks, and the military all depend on this stuff. That demand doesn’t disappear just because the economy slows down. That doesn’t mean stocks can’t drop. They absolutely can. High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility. But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down, not companies blowing up. The dot com crash was about fake businesses failing. Today’s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively. That’s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines. Not saying buy or sell. Just saying this isn’t 2000 all over again. My advice is to stay in the market and continue to dollar cost average!",

      "selftext_processed": "I keep seeing people say “ this feels just like the dot com bubble ” whenever the NASDAQ comes up and I get why . Prices are high tech runs the show and everyone ’ s talking about AI . But the reality today is very different than 2000 especially when you look under the hood . Back in the dot com bubble a huge chunk of companies had no_profits at all . A lot of them didn ’ t even have real products . They were valued based on clicks website traffic or just the idea that “ the internet is the future. ” When money got tighter those companies had nothing_to fall back on . They ran out of cash and went to zero . Today ’ s NASDAQ is led by companies that actually make insane amounts of money . Apple Microsoft Google Nvidia Meta Amazon . These aren ’ t hype machines . They generate real profits every single quarter . Some of them make more cash in a year than entire industries did back then . Another big difference is how important tech is now . In 2000 tech was optional . Today it ’ s infrastructure . Cloud services chips software and data centers run basically everything . Governments hospitals banks and the military all depend on this stuff . That demand doesn ’ t disappear just because the economy slows down . That doesn ’ t mean stocks can ’ t drop . They absolutely can . High prices usually mean lower returns and more volatility . But a drop today would likely be about valuations coming down not_companies blowing up . The dot com crash was about fake businesses failing . Today ’ s market is about real businesses being priced aggressively . That ’ s a big difference that gets lost in the headlines . Not_saying buy or sell . Just saying this isn ’ t 2000 all over again . My advice is to stay in the market and continue to dollar cost average"

Sure, Alexa and Kindle were cool, but honestly, they’re more the exception than the rule, and neither of them is exactly leading the charge anymore.

While Amazon has killed it with platforms like AWS and its marketplace it ’ s never_quite had the product first mentality necessary to thrive in the next major tech wave AI . Sure Alexa and Kindle were cool but honestly they ’ re more the exception than the rule and neither_of them is exactly leading the charge anymore . As we move past the platform era Amazon ’ s reliance on third party innovation especially when it comes to AI may hurt its ability to compete in a space where AI driven products are taking over . What do you think Can Amazon pivot and catch up or is it too late for them to lead in AI"

      "title": "Oil Prices Up, But Can Exxon and Chevron Keep Up? What’s Your Take?",
      "selftext": "Oil prices have been climbing recently, and both Exxon and Chevron have seen their stock prices follow suit. But, I’ve been wondering short term gains are great, but can these two stocks really sustain long term growth just based on rising oil prices? On top of that, with more countries ramping up support for renewable energy, will the big oil players like these be left behind? Personally, I think that while higher oil prices will boost profits, especially for companies like XOM and CVX, the growing push for renewable energy is something that can’t be ignored. With the Biden administration pushing for more clean energy initiatives and Europe speeding up its green transition, traditional oil companies are definitely facing more pressure. I’ve also noticed that Chevron and Exxon are trying to adapt by investing in renewables, but they’re still mostly dependent on oil and gas. Do you guys think this transition will actually work out, or is it just a “temporary” shift? Can they really keep up with the demand for greener alternatives? And let’s not forget about the risk of oil prices dropping. When oil prices fell last year, both XOM and CVX felt the impact. How do you guys see the effect of oil price fluctuations on their long term performance? Right now, holding these might look good short term, but do you think they can keep growing in the long run? What’s your take do you think these stocks are still a good hold, or have they become overpriced at this point? Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",

Full year deliveries came in at 1.64 million, down 8.6% YoY, with an estimate of 1.6 million. The Q4 miss can be attributed to a few key factors: the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit, the aging product line (Model 3/Y still lead but are lacking major updates), increased competition in Europe and China, and some brand image issues. However, the energy storage business has been a bright spot, with deployments hitting 14.2 GWh in Q4 (up 29% YoY) and a total of 46.7 GWh for the year. Demand for Megapack and Powerwall remains strong, which is definitely a positive for the energy division. From a technical perspective, the stock is in a bearish environment, with support at 440 and resistance at 460. The bullish signal at 460 from December 30 has pretty much played out, and the stock has recently dipped below the 440 support. If it doesn’t reclaim 440, it’s likely to fall to 432.5 and 420. If the stock reclaims 440 next week, we could see a rebound, testing the 445, 450, and 460 resistance levels. However, unless it breaks 460 and re-enters a bullish environment, any rally could be short-lived. For those looking to go long, it might be better to wait until the stock breaks and holds above 460 before jumping in. Entering in a bearish market might leave you stuck in a losing position.",

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla just reported Q4 deliveries of 418227 vehicles missing the markets expectations of 440907 a 5.2 % drop . Fullyear deliveries came in at 1.64 million down 8.6 % YoY with an estimate of 1.6 million . The Q4 miss can be attributed to a few key factors the expiration of the U.S. EV tax credit the aging product line Model 3Y still lead but are lacking major updates increased competition in Europe and China and some brand image issues . However the energy storage business has been a bright spot with deployments hitting 14.2 GWh in Q4 up 29 % YoY and a total of 46.7 GWh for the year . Demand for Megapack and Powerwall remains strong which is definitely a positive for the energy division . From a technical perspective the stock is in a bearish environment with support at 440 and resistance at 460 . The bullish signal at 460 from December 30 has pretty much played out and the stock has recently dipped below the 440 support . If it doesn ’ t reclaim 440 it ’ s likely to fall to 432.5 and 420 . If the stock reclaims 440 next week we could see a rebound testing the 445 450 and 460 resistance levels . However unless it breaks 460 and reenters a bullish environment any rally could be shortlived . For those looking to go long it might be better to wait until the stock breaks and holds above 460 before jumping in . Entering in a bearish market might leave you stuck in a losing position ."

      "selftext": "My take on Tesla (TSLA) here: a short‑term rebound early next week (Mon–Tue) looks pretty likely. Today’s volume was actually decent, which matters. This setup reminds me a lot of last year’s Christmas period， low holiday liquidity was used to push the price down, then volume came back starting Jan 2, 2025, and the stock rebounded shortly after. Technically, TSLA is now pulling back toward an important psychological anchor， the dip area after the Dec 8 peak, which is also a heavy volume / cost basis zone. If price stabilizes around this level, a short‑term bounce over the next few sessions wouldn’t be surprising. That said, I don’t think we’re getting a repeat of last January’s massive run. The structure is very different: The main cost‑basis cluster has moved much higher than last year A large portion of shares are now locked up by longs Upside momentum isn’t as clean as it was in early 2025 So my view: Short‑term bounce? Likely. Straight‑line January melt‑up like last year? Very unlikely. Curious how others are positioned here， trading the bounce, or staying on the sidelines until structure improves?",

      "selftext": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market, investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record. Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company’s plans to go public this year were “accurate.” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $800 billion. SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $1.5 trillion when it hits the public market. That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019. Wall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors. Baron Capital’s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company. On top of that, SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund. It’s also the biggest holding in the ARK’s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood. SpaceX has shown leadership in the low-earth orbit, or LEO, market, according to Jefferies. SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year, an increase of more than 30% from the prior quarter and about 70% from a year ago, the bank found. The company launched more than 3,200 satellites in 2025, a new yearly record and increase of more than 60% from the prior year. Analyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX’s launch volume is “accelerating,” while competitor Amazon. Leo is “lagging” despite entering a stable launch phase. Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk’s Starlink. Lin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit all-time highs in the near future. SpaceX’s outlook is bright for another reason: data centers. Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space, Lin said. Space data centers are expected to “drive” the total addressable market for the LEO sector, the analyst added. “In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth’s energy bottleneck, the topic of space data centers has gained momentum,” Lin told clients. To be sure, Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space. However, Yu said he’s “encouraged” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this. “There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics,” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month. A bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk. His controversial $1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year.",

      "selftext_processed": "As billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk readies to take SpaceX to the public market investors are awaiting the chance to get in on what is expected to be the biggest IPO on record . Musk said late last month that reports of the space technology company ’ s plans to go public this year were “ accurate. ” Multiple outlets reported that the IPO was in the works following a share sale valuing the firm at around $ 800 billion . SpaceX is reportedly looking at a value of around $ 1.5 trillion when it hits the public market . That would surpass the prior record set by the Saudi Aramco IPO in 2019 . Wall Street heavy hitters have already begun throwing their weight behind SpaceX as private investors . Baron Capital ’ s Ron Baron said around a quarter of his personal investments are in the company . On top of that SpaceX is one of the largest positions in the Baron Partners Fund . It ’ s also the biggest holding in the ARK ’ s Venture Fund run by Cathie Wood . SpaceX has shown leadership in the lowearth orbit or LEO market according to Jefferies . SpaceX saw a quarterly record for LEO launches at 971 in the final three months of the year an increase of more than 30 % from the prior quarter and about 70 % from a year ago the bank found . The company launched more than 3200 satellites in 2025 a new yearly record and increase of more than 60 % from the prior year . Analyst Kevin Lin told clients that SpaceX ’ s launch volume is “ accelerating ” while competitor Amazon . Leo is “ lagging ” despite entering a stable launch phase . Amazon said in November that businesses could test out its rebranded Leo product as it aimed to make up ground against Musk ’ s Starlink . Lin said he expects the total number of launches from across companies to hit alltime highs in the near future . SpaceX ’ s outlook is bright for another reason data centers . Technology moguls looking for ways to build out infrastructure to support the artificial intelligence boom are increasingly looking to firms like SpaceX that could put data centers in space Lin said . Space data centers are expected to “ drive ” the total addressable market for the LEO sector the analyst added . “ In response to the surge in demand for AI computing power and the Earth ’ s energy bottleneck the topic of space data centers has gained momentum ” Lin told clients . To be sure Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu said there are key problems that need to be worked out in order to effectively put data centers in space . However Yu said he ’ s “ encouraged ” by seeing companies such as Google and OpenAI also looking at how to do this . “ There are clearly technical challenges to making this a viable endeavor but these seem to be engineering constraints as opposed to physics ” Yu wrote to clients in a note last month . A bumper SpaceX IPO could further drive up the wealth for Musk . His controversial $ 1 trillion pay package from his electric vehicle company Tesla was approved by shareholders late last year ."

      "selftext": "SMR (NuScale Power) is having a strong day, but unless I missed something, there’s no obvious company specific catalyst behind the move. This looks more like a broader nuclear sector rotation than a sudden fundamental re rating of SMR itself. A few quick thoughts: The nuclear theme keeps coming back AI, data centers, and grid reliability all support the long term narrative. SMR is still early stage, with long timelines and real execution risk. Historically, SMR tends to move fast when sentiment turns, and cool off just as quickly. Not saying today’s move is wrong just that it feels sentiment driven rather than fundamentals driven. Curious how others here are thinking about it: Long nuclear as a long term infrastructure play, or just trading the volatility? If you want exposure, do you prefer SMR, or broader plays like uranium miners / ETFs? Interested to hear different views.",

      "selftext": "Here is my proposed allocation 2026 and how I rebalanced when the market re-opened today. I am selling all VOO/VTI and replacing with them looking toward a future in 2026 with a weaker dollar and a much larger US debt. SMH is my high risk bet with a 15% trailing stop (and it cranked +3% today so far), I think SMH is the play for 2026 but don't want to be the bag holder when AI purchasing grinds to a halt and it will at some point. **2026 Portfolio Allocation** 30% SCHG (Growth), **US Growth:** Cash-rich monopolies that survive high rates. 20% SCHD (Value), **US Quality:** Companies with real profits, avoiding the \"zombies\" in VTI. 15% SMH (Semis), **High Risk Bet** in the AI buildout 15% Gold (GLD), **The Insurance:** Protection against US dollar \"debasement.\" 10% Int'l (VYMI), **The Escape:** Exposure to non-US economies. 10% Cash (SGOV), **The Parking:** Earns 5% yield while waiting for volatility, keeping any cash here and will DCA in monthly. Because of how US Debt is shifting, buying VTI is not sufficient anymore. I can't prove it but I think the long-term play for the USA is to try and herd everyone into crypto for a pump-n-dump in an effort to pay down the debt. Consider this [The Quiet, Fateful Shift in Who’s Buying America’s Debt]( I named this the \"Gretsky retail investment strategy\", because I am trying to skate to where the puck is going, not where it is today or the path it has been on. No disrespect to the Boggle-Heads but take a hard look at \"VOO and chill\" strategy 5-years from now vs. this allocation. I await your flaming arrows.",

Excuse the language on the broker, I'm just a gambling addict from Turkey. I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.",

Excuse the language on the broker Im just a gambling addict from Turkey . I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the companys performance . Not_exactly an earnings play I was actually planning to hold these longer but especially after Microns huge gains today I couldnt help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next . Im currently thinking maybe Ill buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes ."

Okay that's fair. But my question is, do those professional investment firms who invest hundreds of millions of dollars in stocks/options have any method or intel on the sales trend \"before\" the company publicly shares it? Like do they have some inner circle network that can get info from large car retails in US, Canada, UK etc etc? OR are those professional investment firms just like us and they have no idea how the sales trend is and just rely on news articles and then react after the news hit?",

Okay thats fair . But my question is do those professional investment firms who invest hundreds of millions of dollars in stocksoptions have any method or intel on the sales trend before the company publicly shares it Like do they have some inner circle network that can get info from large car retails in US Canada UK etc etc OR are those professional investment firms just like us and they have no_idea how the sales trend is and just rely on news articles and then react after the news hit"

      "selftext": "First trading day of the year, which means maxing out my Roth IRA, but I have basically ZERO international exposure. I started this Roth IRA back in 2017 and for that first year I dumped everything into VFIFX (2050 Target Date Fund). 2018 to present I have been putting it all into VTSAX because I realized I don't need bonds quite yet. Now as I'm learning more I realize I should probably diversify more to include a greater % of international stocks. The breakdown of the target date fund is around 55 US / 36 INT / 6 US Bond / 2 INT Bond, but this is currently only about 15% of my Roth IRA portfolio. The other 85% is VTSAX. When I started this Roth IRA for whatever reason I chose the mutual funds over the ETF equivalents (maybe ETF wasn't offered then?), and now for my 2026 contribution I'm only given a choice to contribute to another Vanguard Mutual Fund, my 2050 Target Date Fund, or my VTSAX fund. If I wanted to throw this $7500 into an international fund, which should I use? Most of the funds I'm aware of are ETFs, and it doesn't seem I can contribute to an ETF, only Mutual Fund. Should I put it all into VTIAX (Total International Stock Market Fund) then? That would only bring my international allocation up to about 12% within this IRA. Can I transact within the IRAs existing shares to trade some VTSAX shares to International Shares? Or maybe better to get rid of the 2050 Target Date fund shares in favor of International Shares, because that would also ditch the bonds for now? I also see there is an (irreversible option) to convert my mutual fund shares to the ETF equivalents, but I'm not sure if that's worthwhile in this case. FWIW - the Roth IRA sits around $100k (86k VTSAX & 14k VFIFX). I plan on working another 25-30 years, and as a public employee will be looking to start a 403b and then a taxable brokerage account this year. So I suppose another option would be to leave the Roth allocation as is, put the 7500 into more VTSAX, and then start off the other accounts with heavier international exposure? Any and all advice is welcome, thanks.",

Now as Im learning more I realize I should probably diversify more to include a greater % of international stocks . The breakdown of the target date fund is around 55 US 36 INT 6 US Bond 2 INT Bond but this is currently only about 15 % of my Roth IRA portfolio . The other 85 % is VTSAX . When I started this Roth IRA for whatever reason I chose the mutual funds over the ETF equivalents maybe ETF wasnt offered then and now for my 2026 contribution Im only given a choice to contribute to another Vanguard Mutual Fund my 2050 Target Date Fund or my VTSAX fund . If I wanted to throw this $ 7500 into an international fund which should I use Most of the funds Im aware of are ETFs and it doesnt seem I can contribute to an ETF only Mutual Fund . Should I put it all into VTIAX Total International Stock Market Fund then That would only bring my international allocation up to about 12 % within this IRA . Can I transact within the IRAs existing shares to trade some VTSAX shares to International Shares Or maybe better to get rid of the 2050 Target Date fund shares in favor of International Shares because that would also ditch the bonds for now I also see there is an irreversible option to convert my mutual fund shares to the ETF equivalents but Im not_sure if thats worthwhile in this case . FWIW the Roth IRA sits around $ 100k 86k VTSAX 14k VFIFX . I plan on working another 2530 years and as a public employee will be looking to start a 403b and then a taxable brokerage account this year . So I suppose another option would be to leave the Roth allocation as is put the 7500 into more VTSAX and then start off the other accounts with heavier international exposure Any and all advice is welcome thanks ."

      "title": "Six Flags ($FUN): A Turnaround or a Value Trap? This is my thesis on a medium to long-term, long position on $FUN",
      "selftext": "I submitted my thesis over at Value Investors Club, which is hyper-critical of write-ups. While the admins appreciated the submission, it wasn't approved, so I'm posting it here: **Basic Overview** Six Flags Entertainment Corp (NYSE: $FUN) is a special turnaround case currently trading, what I believe undeservedly, at pandemic lows. Before the pandemic, the last time it traded at this price was in 2011. This suggests that the market believes $FUN is in a terminal decline on the brink of bankruptcy. On paper, this might be understandable: Their TTM income is -472M, they have a total debt of nearly $5B, and a market cap of $1.87B. However, investors are paying 10x on EV/EBITDA, suggesting they might be optimistic about the company's future, and the company is giving guidance that EV/EBITDA is 6x, normalized, implying value. Six Flags has massive brand recognition. Even if you've never been to Six Flags before, most Americans know about Six Flags and likely know somebody who has been to one in their lifetime. Six Flags Entertainment also owns theme parks that aren't under their \"Six Flags\" name, so there are many people that go to their local park not necessarily aware they're attending a Six Flags Entertainment park. However, their brand hasn't changed much over the last 30+ years, and its reputation isn't the best. Former-CEO Selim Bassoul said the park became a \"cheap day-care center for teenagers\". The food isn't high quality, the parks and amenities are dirty, and there's a perception of lower safety (despite that not being statistically true). Wealthier families tend to favor flying to Disney or Universal over regional Six Flags trips. A possible dark horse is the company's unutilized real estate asset base. They sit on a ton of real estate, a lot of it is unutilized, therefore not generating revenue (or not being monetized in a significant way). A 2022 article from Land & Buildings Investment Management claimed that Six Flags owned property in 17 of its parks \"worth more than the stock value of the company\". In 2022, FUN traded at between $40-60/share. According to Six Flags' 2024 Form 10-K, several parks are on land that is leased, implying that the land is already monetized, but what's even more interesting is that there's at least 2,070 acres of identifiable surplus land, probably more. This unutilized land can be used for hotels, restaurants, shops, and more pleasures beyond the typical theme park. If it were me, I'd quickly turn the lowest value land into a solar farm for the park. **JANA Partners Investment** In October of 2025, JANA Partners took a 9% stake in $FUN, approximately $200M. JANA Partners are \"activist investors\". Their entire model is to do extensive research to identify undervalued companies, collaborate with them to create asymmetric upside, then get out when their job is done. JANA's most notable investments in the last decade: 1. Whole Foods: 8.8% stake, pushed for board changes and tech upgrades. Their pressure led to Amazon's acquisition for $13.7B. 2. PetSmart: 10% stake, pushed for sale due to poor performance and sold to BC Partners for $8.7B. 3. ConAgra: 7.2% stake, pushed for board changes and operational improvements. Added former Nestle CEO and Walgreens executive to the board. 4. Tiffany & Co.: 5.1% stake, appointed 3 new directors and improved brand strategy and governance. 5. Pinnacle Foods: 9.1% stake, pushed for cost cuts and strategic changes. Pinnacle was acquired by ConAgre for $8.1B. Other activist investments include Qualcomm, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Walgreens Boot Alliance, Apache, Safeway, Ashland, McGraw Hill, Pinterest, and more. Many people may have seen the headlines recently about the legendary, American Football tight-end, Travis Kelce's investment in FUN. He is also engaged to global music icon, Taylor Swift. Travis' investment was facilitated by JANA Partners. Aside from his legendary football status, he also has a podcast with his brother, another legendary football player. It's clear that JANA plans to leverage Kelce and his relations as a modern brand anchor, bridging sports and pop-culture among a younger demographic. His and his family's ability to reach the younger generation is insurmountable by nobody else in the world, in my opinion. **Turnaround Implementation and Difficulties** The goals JANA listed included: revamping marketing/branding, improving technology and guest experience, assessing leadership and governance, reviewing potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities. JANA's managing partner, Scott Ostfeld, said there's \"substantial opportunity to drive improved park attendance and brand engagement through a re-energizing of its marketing and branding, emphasizing guest experience.\" Their primary goal will likely be to fix Six Flag's reputation. I suspect they'll increase park prices (maybe dynamic pricing) and justify it by offering more premium food, app-based passes and ordering, better atmosphere, less crowding, cleaner parks, more security, and generally a more premium feel that still costs less than Disney and Universal. I also believe they'll rebrand to a more family-friendly park, as opposed to a make-everyone-scream model. They will also leverage as much of that extra 2,000+ acres as possible. According to TEA (The Themed Entertainment Association) and AECOM (Theme Index/Museum Index), large, North American theme parks have only seen marginal growth in the last decade, suggesting the market is mature. What this means for Six Flags Entertainment is that the path to revenue is efficiency, monetization, and capital discipline, not so much growth, but a successful rebrand will likely bring more people to the park. Personally, when I attended Six Flags Great America in the mid 2000s (I had to look this up), a day ticket was $59. TODAY it's $59! Inflation adjusted, the ticket price today should be about $100. At the risk of deviating from analysis, that's insane. I'm concerned that entertainment is evermore fleeting as we become consumed by 10 second Instagram reels. Disney World continuously proves me wrong on this. $FUN was recently named in a securities class action lawsuit related to merger disclosures around under-investment. These cases aren't uncommon after large, underperforming mergers and typically focus on historical disclosures rather than current operating economics. While the outcome and cost are uncertain, settlements in similar cases have usually been manageable relative to cash flow and often covered by insurance. Importantly, this isn’t a new fundamental problem so much as a symptom of past governance issues, exactly the kind of situation activist investors like JANA look for. At worst, it likely slows the turnaround timeline; it doesn’t change the core question of whether the business can improve margins, reduce debt, and earn a higher valuation over several years. JANA has not yet publicly detailed a timeline or financial targets and metrics, but based on their track record, I suspect they're looking at a \\~3-4yr time horizon. Estimating a share price by then will be wildly speculative, but $FUN was just over $70/share in 2017, and that was not because they were doing things better than what they could do with JANA's turnaround plan. The catalyst would be the Board+JANA's release of the full turnaround plan. That plan would be comprehensive, and I suspect will come out Q1 or Q2 2026. That plan should include everything I previously mentioned in monetary detail, with debt-payoff expectations, pricing changes, detailed rebranding plan, capex and leverage of existing land, executive leadership changes, and asset sales. This is when the real spotlight will be put on Six Flags Entertainment. After that, the plan needs to be proven. Bankruptcy risk is non-trivial but contingent on a confluence of (re)-operational failure, macro downturn, and refinancing stress. **I have a small percentage of my portfolio in a long-position on $FUN**",

      "selftext_processed": "I submitted my thesis over at Value Investors Club which is hypercritical of writeups . While the admins appreciated the submission it wasnt approved so Im posting it here Basic Overview Six Flags Entertainment Corp NYSE $ FUN is a special turnaround case currently trading what I believe undeservedly at pandemic lows . Before the pandemic the last time it traded at this price was in 2011 . This suggests that the market believes $ FUN is in a terminal decline on the brink of bankruptcy . On paper this might be understandable Their TTM income is 472M they have a total debt of nearly $ 5B and a market cap of $ 1.87B . However investors are paying 10x on EVEBITDA suggesting they might be optimistic about the companys future and the company is giving guidance that EVEBITDA is 6x normalized implying value . Six Flags has massive brand recognition . Even if youve never_been to Six Flags before most Americans know about Six Flags and likely know somebody who has been to one in their lifetime . Six Flags Entertainment also owns theme parks that arent under their Six Flags name so there are many people that go to their local park not_necessarily aware theyre attending a Six Flags Entertainment park . However their brand hasnt changed much over the last 30 years and its reputation isnt the best . FormerCEO Selim Bassoul said the park became a cheap daycare center for teenagers . The food isnt high quality the parks and amenities are dirty and theres a perception of lower safety despite that not_being statistically true . Wealthier families tend to favor flying to Disney or Universal over regional Six Flags trips . A possible dark horse is the companys unutilized real estate asset base . They sit on a ton of real estate a lot of it is unutilized therefore not_generating revenue or not_being monetized in a significant way . A 2022 article from Land Buildings Investment Management claimed that Six Flags owned property in 17 of its parks worth more than the stock value of the company . In 2022 FUN traded at between $ 4060share . According to Six Flags 2024 Form 10K several parks are on land that is leased implying that the land is already monetized but whats even more interesting is that theres at least 2070 acres of identifiable surplus land probably more . This unutilized land can be used for hotels restaurants shops and more pleasures beyond the typical theme park . If it were me Id quickly turn the lowest value land into a solar farm for the park . JANA Partners Investment In October of 2025 JANA Partners took a 9 % stake in $ FUN approximately $ 200M . JANA Partners are activist investors . Their entire model is to do extensive research to identify undervalued companies collaborate with them to create asymmetric upside then get out when their job is done . JANAs most notable investments in the last decade 1 . Whole Foods 8.8 % stake pushed for board changes and tech upgrades . Their pressure led to Amazons acquisition for $ 13.7B . 2 . PetSmart 10 % stake pushed for sale due to poor performance and sold to BC Partners for $ 8.7B . 3 . ConAgra 7.2 % stake pushed for board changes and operational improvements . Added former Nestle CEO and Walgreens executive to the board . 4 . Tiffany Co. 5.1 % stake appointed 3 new directors and improved brand strategy and governance . 5 . Pinnacle Foods 9.1 % stake pushed for cost cuts and strategic changes . Pinnacle was acquired by ConAgre for $ 8.1B . Other activist investments include Qualcomm BristolMyers Squibb Walgreens Boot Alliance Apache Safeway Ashland McGraw Hill Pinterest and more . Many people may have seen the headlines recently about the legendary American Football tightend Travis Kelces investment in FUN . He is also engaged to global music icon Taylor Swift . Travis investment was facilitated by JANA Partners . Aside from his legendary football status he also has a podcast with his brother another legendary football player . Its clear that JANA plans to leverage Kelce and his relations as a modern brand anchor bridging sports and popculture among a younger demographic . His and his familys ability to reach the younger generation is insurmountable by nobody_else in the world in my opinion . Turnaround Implementation and Difficulties The goals JANA listed included revamping marketingbranding improving technology and guest experience assessing leadership and governance reviewing potential acquisition or divestiture opportunities . JANAs managing partner Scott Ostfeld said theres substantial opportunity to drive improved park attendance and brand engagement through a reenergizing of its marketing and branding emphasizing guest experience . Their primary goal will likely be to fix Six Flags reputation . I suspect theyll increase park prices maybe dynamic pricing and justify it by offering more premium food appbased passes and ordering better atmosphere less crowding cleaner parks more security and generally a more premium feel that still costs less than Disney and Universal . I also believe theyll rebrand to a more familyfriendly park as opposed to a makeeveryonescream model . They will also leverage as much of that extra 2000 acres as possible . According to TEA The Themed Entertainment Association and AECOM Theme IndexMuseum Index large North American theme parks have only seen marginal growth in the last decade suggesting the market is mature . What this means for Six Flags Entertainment is that the path to revenue is efficiency monetization and capital discipline not_so much growth but a successful rebrand will likely bring more people to the park . Personally when I attended Six Flags Great America in the mid 2000s I had to look this up a day ticket was $ 59 . TODAY its $ 59 Inflation adjusted the ticket price today should be about $ 100 . At the risk of deviating from analysis thats insane . Im concerned that entertainment is evermore fleeting as we become consumed by 10 second Instagram reels . Disney World continuously proves me wrong on this . $ FUN was recently named in a securities class action lawsuit related to merger disclosures around underinvestment . These cases arent uncommon after large underperforming mergers and typically focus on historical disclosures rather than current operating economics . While the outcome and cost are uncertain settlements in similar cases have usually been manageable relative to cash flow and often covered by insurance . Importantly this isn ’ t a new fundamental problem so much as a symptom of past governance issues exactly the kind of situation activist investors like JANA look for . At worst it likely slows the turnaround timeline it doesn ’ t change the core question of whether the business can improve margins reduce debt and earn a higher valuation over several years . JANA has not_yet publicly detailed a timeline or financial targets and metrics but based on their track record I suspect theyre looking at a 34yr time horizon . Estimating a share price by then will be wildly speculative but $ FUN was just over $ 70share in 2017 and that was not_because they were doing things better than what they could do with JANAs turnaround plan . The catalyst would be the BoardJANAs release of the full turnaround plan . That plan would be comprehensive and I suspect will come out Q1 or Q2 2026 . That plan should include everything I previously mentioned in monetary detail with debtpayoff expectations pricing changes detailed rebranding plan capex and leverage of existing land executive leadership changes and asset sales . This is when the real spotlight will be put on Six Flags Entertainment . After that the plan needs to be proven . Bankruptcy risk is nontrivial but contingent on a confluence of reoperational failure macro downturn and refinancing stress . I have a small percentage of my portfolio in a longposition on $ FUN"

      "selftext": "I promised myself I’d step away from the screen to spend time with family this New Year, but damn... I just can't look away! Market opened with a massive green wave, thought it was a late \"Santa Rally\". But while most tickers started retracing, a few of my favorites are absolutely mooning. ASTS is the star of the show today, currently up 10.2% (trading at $80.06). MU is also showing insane strength, up over 9.2% as we speak. I’m so glad I didn’t panic-sell before the holidays. Watching the \"New Year Bonus\" roll in feels incredible. But it begs the question: Is 2026 finally the year ASTS hits the lunar surface? With the successful deployment of BlueBird 6 and the SpaceX IPO (targeting that legendary $1.5T valuation) looming, the sentiment around space stocks is shifting from \"speculative\" to \"critical infrastructure.\" Are you guys holding through the year? What’s your outlook on the space sector for 2026?",

I just cant look away Market opened with a massive green wave thought it was a late Santa Rally . But while most tickers started retracing a few of my favorites are absolutely mooning . ASTS is the star of the show today currently up 10.2 % trading at $ 80.06 . MU is also showing insane strength up over 9.2 % as we speak . I ’ m so glad I didn ’ t panicsell before the holidays . Watching the New Year Bonus roll in feels incredible . But it begs the question Is 2026 finally the year ASTS hits the lunar surface With the successful deployment of BlueBird 6 and the SpaceX IPO targeting that legendary $ 1.5T valuation looming the sentiment around space stocks is shifting from speculative to critical infrastructure . Are you guys holding through the year What ’ s your outlook on the space sector for 2026"

      "selftext": "Hello everyone! For background, I am almost 19yo. I've been working at Walmart for a little over 6 months as a Pharmacy Technician while I pursue my undergraduate studies that will hopefully land me in pharmacy school. As for my \"portfolio\" I have invested in VOO and NVDA through vanguard but no insane amount or anything contributed (roughly 1k). Considering I haven't hit my 1 year anniversary, Walmart doesn't match my 401k yet but I have still been contributing 6%. Contributions to date: $503 Current balance: $475 (I guess that means it went down??) - Question 1 being: Should I wait to keep investing until they match? - Question 2: Should I invest in Walmart stocks through my associate app? If so should I do the max contribution? ($70 per paycheck for the max amount of matched contribution at 15% aka $10.50) Or am I overdoing it and need to just save this money in my high-yield towards college. (I am currently managing paying off my undergrad tuition just fine, but pharmacy school can be as much as 26k a year for 4 years)",

      "selftext": "TSMC just got its annual US export license to move chip manufacturing equipment to its Nanjing plant. This approval came before their previous end-user authorization expired, and TSMC confirmed they don’t need individual vendor licenses, ensuring fab operations and product deliveries continue uninterrupted. Samsung and SK Hynix also got approval to ship US chip equipment to China, which seems like a positive signal for the industry. Earnings are coming up on 01/15 is TSM the last hope, or is this record high just masking something? I’m holding a 10% position should I keep holding, chase the rally, or maybe play some calls? I’m not sure if this spike is just sentiment-driven, so I’m on the fence. Curious what everyone else is doing still holding TSM, or taking profits before earnings?",

      "selftext": "In early December 2025, I performed a back door ROTH for the first time last month. I opened up a traditional IRA account with Fidelity and deposited $8k (I am 50 yo) into the settlement account (which was SPAXX). As soon as the system allowed me to do it (I was checking daily, multiple times a day … it took a couple of days), I changed the settlement position to Cash FDIC deposit), and then I transferred the $8k into my ROTH IRA. The traditional IRA showed 0, which is what it should be. All good for the past month. Today I saw there is $1.21 in the settlement account of my traditional IRA. I guess the money must have earned interest during the 1-2 days it was sitting in there. I obviously don’t want any money sitting in my traditional IRA. What should I do? I’m actually thinking I will perform another backdoor Roth, contributing $8498.79 and then immediately move ALL in the funds in the account to my Roth IRA. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "2025 ended up being a pretty great year! 47% return for $6,800,000 A decent amount of gains are from selling options, and some great gains on being heavy long on RDDT and GOOG with shares and calls). All in all, I typically have around 30 unique tickers and about 150 positions open at any given time. Those positions can be relatively small, up to hundreds of contracts. Yes, lots of people had better returns in 2025. I’m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges. With the market going up for 8 months straight, my hedges hurt quite a bit. But should a black swan event have occurred, or the market switched to bear mode, I would have done pretty well (especially compared to the market). Here’s to 2026 being a good one as well!",

      "selftext": "I have been lurking in here for many years now, and I think its an extraordinary place to find undervalued stocks or great businesses overall, either to trade or to invest in. I have seen it mentioned here before, but even then, maybe 1% of the amount of mentions it truly deserves. this stock is HIMS. I believe (my bad, I mean I KNOW), it is going to potentially triple, or even more, in 2026, and every person here should take a look at it. Lets look at the facts: First of all, their financial statements 1. Revenue has been increasing for many years now, 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024, and expected 2.25b in 2025. Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2. Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4. Buying back shares 5. Great Margins Technicals: It has been on a long-term uptrend since may of 2022, with higher highs, and higher lows. during this time, it has had 10 declines of 30% or more (3 of them 50% or more, including the current one). EACH TIME it declined, it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 65-70$ range. This year, it made its ATH in February at 73$, and it touched the 65-70$ range 4 times, which is now a major resistance range. currently, its at 33 dollars, which is its 3rd 50%+ decline, and 10th decline of 30% or more since may 2022. NOT BUYING right now, does not make ANY SENSE. its had a 100% success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years, and now its no different. It has now made a double bottom, and its already at a pretty nice support level. I believe it has BOTTOMED. Moreover, this year alone, they have announced LABS, Canada expansion, Europe expansion, some acquisitions, Testosterone treatments, and many more to come. Now, just due to technicals its a very easy double from here, BUT, I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026, and this is why: 1. Institutional Ownership - 239m shares. Shares outstanding - 228m Total float of shares - 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT - 67m. this stock is ridiculously shorted, with 0 logic behind it, and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2. Potential NVO partnership, which is a major catalyst if it happens (and I think it will). 3. Rumors about the FDA & HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding. HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility. If this is true, ITS MASSIVE. the potential catalysts + fundamentals + Technicals are saying 1 thing - the stock is going to have a great 2026, and im very shocked it is not the 1# mention here. This is NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, im just sharing my opinion. my position - 6000 shares at 39.76$",

      "selftext_processed": "I have been lurking in here for many years now and I think its an extraordinary place to find undervalued stocks or great businesses overall either to trade or to invest in . I have seen it mentioned here before but even then maybe 1 % of the amount of mentions it truly deserves . this stock is HIMS . I believe my bad I mean I KNOW it is going to potentially triple or even more in 2026 and every person here should take a look at it . Lets look at the facts First of all their financial statements 1 . Revenue has been increasing for many years now 148m in 2020 to 1.47b in 2024 and expected 2.25b in 2025 . Projecting over 6.5b in 2030 2 . Profitable and positive cash flow 3. healthy balance sheet 4 . Buying back shares 5 . Great Margins Technicals It has been on a longterm uptrend since may of 2022 with higher highs and higher lows . during this time it has had 10 declines of 30 % or more 3 of them 50 % or more including the current one . EACH TIME it declined it recovered either to an ATH or this year to the 6570 $ range . This year it made its ATH in February at 73 $ and it touched the 6570 $ range 4 times which is now a major resistance range . currently its at 33 dollars which is its 3rd 50 % decline and 10th decline of 30 % or more since may 2022 . NOT_BUYING right now does not_make ANY SENSE . its had a 100 % success rate of recovering from each major decline the past 3.5 years and now its no_different . It has now made a double bottom and its already at a pretty nice support level . I believe it has BOTTOMED . Moreover this year alone they have announced LABS Canada expansion Europe expansion some acquisitions Testosterone treatments and many more to come . Now just due to technicals its a very easy double from here BUT I believe it is going to go PARABOLIC in 2026 and this is why 1 . Institutional Ownership 239m shares . Shares outstanding 228m Total float of shares 184m TOTAL SHARES SHORT 67m . this stock is ridiculously shorted with 0 logic behind it and it is setting up for a very easy parabolic move 2 . Potential NVO partnership which is a major catalyst if it happens and I think it will . 3 . Rumors about the FDA HHS revising the list of PEPTIDES allowed for compounding . HIMS is the only telehealth company in the US that has a peptide compounding facility . If this is true ITS MASSIVE . the potential catalysts fundamentals Technicals are saying 1 thing the stock is going to have a great 2026 and im very shocked it is not_the 1 mention here . This is NOT_FINANCIAL ADVICE im just sharing my opinion . my position 6000 shares at 39.76 $"

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I’m new to picking individual stocks and investing in my own, but not to investing in general. I have a good amount of money split between retirement accounts and a separate brokerage account. However, I would like to start to buy some more individual stock with “play money” that’s less the 1% of my total portfolio. Questions I have for you guys. Obviously tech and AI and tech/ai adjacent fields is on everyone’s radar, but how do you guys go about setting you “buy in” prices for these companies? I guess also just looking for any wisdom or advice. I’m not looking to day trade or make millions in a year. Just tried to pick good anchors, some I see able to grow still and the a few long shots with my horizon being 2-5 + years. I know these are basic questions, so don’t destroy me too hard. I don’t really have other people or friends into investing outside chasing hype companies Thanks \\* edit\\* I guess I should rephrase, how to determine appropriate entry prices for companies. I was not aware “buy-in” was a separate technical term.",

      "selftext": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick. I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened... The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism. I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\". [The delivery process]( I instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open. **If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.** I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip. # Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer? It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly: 1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000 Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important): ± 200 people / 100.000 **.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.** ( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.) \\----- Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts: Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors). This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that. Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission. So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed): USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.** [Unlocking my full potential]( Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower. Now that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern. # A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter. If you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE. 1. The technical guy who actually knows shit 2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO. This is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China. The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart. The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team. After the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely). The best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit. All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial. # Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of: \"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant) The study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying. So why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive. **WHY?:** * Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups * You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%) * All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis. * A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn. **But most importantly:** * BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS. # Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money. # So Why Are You Bearish? Well I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?: (1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) (2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) Which is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)? I'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation. The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately. Hence I'm buying puts. **NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement. **My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:** EDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.",

      "selftext_processed": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick . I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing_happened ... The problem Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it wont speed up its effects . You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached Llysine amino acid that breaks off in your body using enzymes ... thus creating this slowrelease mechanism . I wasnt discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me the edge . The delivery process I instantly got hit with Writers euphoria some people say they see colors all I saw was a pumpndump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump . Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open . If you havent figured it out yet Im talking about SLS . I will attack this pumpndump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this short trip . Buckle up buckeroos were gon na start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt . cap close to USD 600M . First thing that I ask is who is the customer Its a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 12 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer Acute Myleoid Leukemia . If we look at how many people get it globally were gon na arrive at roughly 1.52.0 persons 100.000 Now lets look at all cancers this will be important ± 200 people 100.000 .... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN . What I didnt realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being . Why am I mentioning all cancers Well its to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pumpndump posts That this is a replacement for Keytruda which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80 % gross margins . But heres the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts Keytruda is allpurpose while the shit that SLS is producing is NOT_You need to be tested for the presence of WT1 antigen which is only done for blood disorderscancers . You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing_about it being usable for this source I know a few doctors . This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100 ... SLS drugs will barely target 1 % of that . Why do I say barely Well because that these drugs are given to specific people ... CDK9 is effective only for people with a certain less common mutation and GPS is given to my understanding to people in remission . So lets do simple math before I make you even more depressed USD 25B 1 % 250M lets be optimistic and say that 80 % are eligible 200M But wait it gets better ... however right now my heart is pumping pupils are needlepoint sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk ... low doses of ketamine . Unlocking my full potential Keytruda gets administered constantly unlike GPS which is like 20 injections . So that 200M you were looking at Yea its probably way lower . Now that weve got over the HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS lets focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEOs marketingdilution pattern . A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter . If youve ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE . 1 . The technical guy who actually knows shit 2 . The bullshitter whos liked but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if hes career driven will become a good CTO . The second one will become CEO . This is true for every profession reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell especially bullshit to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity . Its all a zerosum game . Nobody_wins especially not_the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like whitemonkeys are in China . The CEO SLS is no_different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter . How do you become a master bullshitter Ambiguity . Think of the 1 technical guy he will always be precise in his formulations because he knows what hes talking about . the 2 bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart . The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members read bagholders and MLM leaders parrot the actual but notfactual_message to the masses . Just look up the recent posts on bagholderpnd subreddits for SLS . Its all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team . After the share price jumps high the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion not_including the perpetual warrant inducement plan which alone makes acquisition very unlikely . The best part The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50 % shareholders want to lower his abovestandard pay . And theres a good reason hes getting such high cash bonuses he knows its all bullshit . All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired which is unlikely it will be sold at a discount and not_a premium . Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $ 4 a share ... with constantly increasing share count its amplifying the speed at which the companys valuation grows even though they still havent really presented anything substantial . Lets Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $ 4 Results of the REGAL study were postponed which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of Were still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study . Which is absolutely hilarious . Because it doesnt say anything about SLS specifically yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one it may be but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant The study includes both BAT best available treatment and the SLS drugs . The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones while the SLS patients have already died grim I know . Their argument Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever theyre saying . So why do people think its good news for SLS Because people think they understand statistics when they actually dont . Heck I studied it specialized in it as a mathematician ... and even I will never_dare to say that I fully understand statistics . Reality is that the delay might be negative neutral or positive . WHY Many factors come into patient selection The study isnt the typical lets pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests they come in different cohortsgroups You have high odds of selecting the good group that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment this can be 1015 % All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should which is a very misleading statistic and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people ... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years and that will average out so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not_enough to know if there is a statistical significance . Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis . A small sample size like this is prone to distortions follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not_which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn . But most importantly BAT for AML has significantly improved ... and by significantly I mean really significantly . The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 1012 months . Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS . Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production . Given their current free cash its more than likely that they will need to raise more money . So Why Are You Bearish Well I like to think of it in terms of probability uncertainty specifically conditional probability . Lets denote Pevent A as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening Asks yourself this which probability is higher 1 P Good News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad 2 P Bad News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad Which is more likely to be true 1 2 or 1 2 Im gon na go with the likelihood of bad news as probable ... This doesnt mean that the drug wont work I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no_matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections wont be as high as the current valuation . The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their lifesaving medication out there ... This isnt the age of biotech unfortunately . Hence Im buying puts . NOTE Im not_a biochemist I might be wrong and Im betting only money that Im willing to lose so dont follow blindly do your own DD . Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots . One last thing ... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement . My position is small because Im locked down in other trades sharing mostly because I like to do equity research EDIT To the existing and new bots out there the SLS cult and other believers yes I will double down if the stock price goes up Answering here since I received very nice DM requests ."

I still think the geopolitical risk around Taiwan hasn’t gone away it’s a real factor in TSM’s valuation.

      "selftext": "TSLA is up over 2% in premarket trading, even though its Q4 delivery and production numbers came in below expectations. Here are the key figures from the release: Q4 deliveries: 418,227 vehicles (vs. estimates around 440,907) Q4 production: 434,358 vehicles (vs. projected \\~470,780) Full-year 2025 deliveries: 1,636,129 vehicles On the surface, this looks like a miss across both deliveries and production, which would normally pressure the stock. Yet the market reaction is clearly positive heading into the open. A few possible reasons for the move: Expectations may have already been lowered going into the print Investors could be focusing more on margin stabilization, AI/robotics, autonomy, or longer-term narratives rather than near-term unit counts Positioning and short-term flows dominating the open rather than fundamentals This sets up an interesting question for today’s session: Is this strength sustainable, or is it just a knee‑jerk premarket reaction before the market digests the numbers more fully?

As of now, all three major stock index futures are rising: Dow futures are higher S&P 500 futures are up Nasdaq 100 futures are up nearly 1%, with the tech sector showing relative strength Market risk appetite has clearly rebounded at the start of the new year, with capital flowing back into growth and tech sectors. Meanwhile, another major market focus is TSLA, as Tesla's Q4 2025 delivery data is about to be released. This will be one of the key catalysts impacting the stock price in the short term and may also spill over to influence sentiment across the entire new energy vehicle and technology sectors. Key points to watch: Will the indices follow a New Year trend? Or will Tesla's delivery data present trading opportunities? Share your thoughts on the market outlook for the start of 2026.",

      "title": "Tesla reports 418,227 deliveries for the fourth quarter, down 16%",
      "selftext": "Tesla posted its fourth-quarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday. Here are the key numbers: * Total deliveries: 418,227 * Total production: 434,358 Wall Street expected 426,000 deliveries for the quarter, according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount. In a company-compiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29, Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15% drop from a year earlier to 422,850 vehicles for the quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Elon Musk’s EV company reported 495,570 deliveries and production of 459,445 vehicles. Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China’s BYD, South Korea’s Kia and Hyundai, and Volkswagen in Europe. Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla, but are not precisely defined in the company’s shareholder communications. In its energy business, Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter, following a record in the prior period, when it deployed 12.5 GWh. Tesla’s battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities. Sales of Tesla’s cars were impacted by President Donald Trump’s decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30, earlier than previously planned. The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers. Even before that, the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla. After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House, Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president’s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce. Musk also endorsed Germany’s extremist anti-immigrant party, AfD, and later supported British anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activist Tommy Robinson. In recent weeks, Musk has called to abolish the European Union. Partly in response to Musk’s incendiary rhetoric, Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S. The company hasn’t fully recovered despite introducing a new, more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October. However, Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year, jumping 40% in the third quarter, reaching a fresh record in mid-December. Musk bought $1 billion worth of shares in September. Shareholders approved a new $1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company. The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn’t pass. Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn’t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work, and that there are no limits on his political activity. While Tesla doesn’t break out deliveries geographically, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association (ACEA) showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025. Tesla’s European registrations fell 39% in the first 11 months of 2025, while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240% in Europe. Overall, battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025, amounting to around 16% of all new vehicles sold there. Some analysts project that sales of Tesla’s more affordable Model Y standard, which the company launched in October, will help the company regain ground in coming quarters. In a note last week, analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Brazil, where robust consumer interest could create meaningful long-term upside for Tesla, even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers.” Besides BYD, Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely. But Tesla is selling investors on Musk’s vision of the future, or what he calls “sustainable abundance,” more than EV sales. That vision includes robotaxis, which Musk has promised for years, and humanoid robots, which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers, babysitters, crime stoppers and surgeons.

      "selftext_processed": "Tesla posted its fourthquarter 2025 vehicle production and deliveries report on Friday . Here are the key numbers Total deliveries 418227 Total production 434358 Wall Street expected 426000 deliveries for the quarter according to estimates compiled by StreetAccount . In a companycompiled consensus posted to its website on Dec. 29 Tesla said analysts it surveyed were expecting a 15 % drop from a year earlier to 422850 vehicles for the quarter . In the fourth quarter of 2024 Elon Musk ’ s EV company reported 495570 deliveries and production of 459445 vehicles . Tesla faces heightened competition in the electric vehicle market from China ’ s BYD South Korea ’ s Kia and Hyundai and Volkswagen in Europe . Deliveries are the closest approximation of sales reported by Tesla but are not_precisely defined in the company ’ s shareholder communications . In its energy business Tesla said that it deployed 14.2 gigawatt hours of battery energy storage products in the fourth quarter following a record in the prior period when it deployed 12.5 GWh . Tesla ’ s battery energy storage systems include backup batteries for homes and larger systems used alongside data centers and utilities . Sales of Tesla ’ s cars were impacted by President Donald Trump ’ s decision to end a federal EV incentive by Sept. 30 earlier than previously planned . The expiration pulled some EV sales forward to the third quarter for Tesla and other automakers . Even before that the start of 2025 was a struggle for Tesla . After spending heavily to propel Trump back to the White House Musk spent the first quarter of the year leading the president ’ s DOGE initiative to slash the federal workforce . Musk also endorsed Germany ’ s extremist antiimmigrant party AfD and later supported British antiMuslim and antiimmigration activist Tommy Robinson . In recent weeks Musk has called to abolish the European Union . Partly in response to Musk ’ s incendiary rhetoric Tesla has faced an enduring consumer backlash in Europe and the U.S . The company hasn ’ t fully recovered despite introducing a new more affordable version of its Model Y SUV in October . However Tesla shares still rallied in the second half of the year jumping 40 % in the third quarter reaching a fresh record in midDecember . Musk bought $ 1 billion worth of shares in September . Shareholders approved a new $ 1 trillion pay plan for Musk in November that will give the CEO more shares and increased control over the company . The vote came after Musk threatened to potentially leave Tesla if the plan didn ’ t pass . Critics voiced concerns that the plan doesn ’ t require Musk to spend a minimum amount of time on his Tesla work and that there are no_limits on his political activity . While Tesla doesn ’ t break out deliveries geographically data from the European Automobile Manufacturers ’ Association ACEA showed that the company lost market share in the region in 2025 . Tesla ’ s European registrations fell 39 % in the first 11 months of 2025 while Chinese rival BYD saw registrations rise 240 % in Europe . Overall battery electric vehicles were more widely embraced in Europe in 2025 amounting to around 16 % of all new vehicles sold there . Some analysts project that sales of Tesla ’ s more affordable Model Y standard which the company launched in October will help the company regain ground in coming quarters . In a note last week analysts at Cannacord Genuity wrote that EV adoption “ is rising quickly in emerging markets such as Thailand Vietnam and Brazil where robust consumer interest could create meaningful longterm upside for Tesla even as it faces fierce rivalry from Chinese automakers. ” Besides BYD Tesla now faces competition from other Chinese EV makers including Xiaomi and Geely . But Tesla is selling investors on Musk ’ s vision of the future or what he calls “ sustainable abundance ” more than EV sales . That vision includes robotaxis which Musk has promised for years and humanoid robots which he says will someday be able to serve as factory workers babysitters crime stoppers and surgeons . Source"

      "selftext": "Hi all. I just started investing last May and really didn’t think much of it. I knew the basics but now my knowledge has really grown to where I feel I have many choices, but I really want to stick to the Boglehead philosophy of investing (I think it’s the most efficient and in many cases, the safest). With how the markets have been recently, my ETFs grew! I am currently only invested in VTI and VXUS. I now make biweekly contributions as well. I plan to stay invested for the long term. I was thinking of also investing in bonds and CDs. However! I’ve heard mixed reviews on this. Some say to not invest in bonds when you’re young because you should be more risky. However, I think the market is going to take a downturn and bonds might be a safe bet. I also was thinking of REITs and some ETFs focused on silver mining (due to the EV explosion). But then this takes away from a boglehead approach and becomes complicated. I also know that REITs are not efficient with taxes since the income from dividends can be high. Plus, I’m just also not experienced with investing. Most of my money is in a terrible HYSA, and while it’s safe, I believe it could be put to work. So, what are your thoughts on REITs and tapping into ETFs that might have some potential due to the EV and AI explosion?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all . I just started investing last May and really didn ’ t think much of it . I knew the basics but now my knowledge has really grown to where I feel I have many choices but I really want to stick to the Boglehead philosophy of investing I think it ’ s the most efficient and in many cases the safest . With how the markets have been recently my ETFs grew I am currently only invested in VTI and VXUS . I now make biweekly contributions as well . I plan to stay invested for the long term . I was thinking of also investing in bonds and CDs . However I ’ ve heard mixed reviews on this . Some say to not_invest in bonds when you ’ re young because you should be more risky . However I think the market is going to take a downturn and bonds might be a safe bet . I also was thinking of REITs and some ETFs focused on silver mining due to the EV explosion . But then this takes away from a boglehead approach and becomes complicated . I also know that REITs are not_efficient with taxes since the income from dividends can be high . Plus I ’ m just also not_experienced with investing . Most of my money is in a terrible HYSA and while it ’ s safe I believe it could be put to work . So what are your thoughts on REITs and tapping into ETFs that might have some potential due to the EV and AI explosion"

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend.

      "selftext": "I’m based in Europe, and this is the main source of my predicament. I am aware on how finding 2/3 ETFs and just accumulate and forget is a hands off approach for a long time investing for non professionals. Rebalancing once a year if needed and carry on. My portfolio has a bit of a mix of single stocks which have done good and don’t plan to liquidate, but I also don’t plan to buy in more besides a very small portion of my budget every now and then when a stock is undervalued and would still be coherent with my long investment horizon. I did some research and figured 3 ETFs that would give me the kind of exposure I feel most comfortable with, but while going through my portfolio ready to do my monthly purchase I realised the commission fee is on the higher end 3/4€) per purchase (IBKR). The three ETFs are XUSA, VWRA and DGRW, and purchasing once a month will erode a portion of my cash in a way I’m not too comfortable with. Question is: is it better to do bulk purchases, 1/2 per year, even if I don’t like cash idling in my account, or is there a set of ETFs which will do that same job without having such commission fee? My main concept is to have a limited exposure to US markets, between 35-45% of my portfolio. I have mutual funds on the side which are 100% focused on Asia and emerging markets and those are held with my bank, so technically not part of this portfolio. Any question that can be useful to have a more “tailored” response is greatly appreciated. Happy 2026!",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m based in Europe and this is the main source of my predicament . I am aware on how finding 23 ETFs and just accumulate and forget is a hands off approach for a long time investing for non professionals . Rebalancing once a year if needed and carry on . My portfolio has a bit of a mix of single stocks which have done good and don ’ t plan to liquidate but I also don ’ t plan to buy in more besides a very small portion of my budget every now and then when a stock is undervalued and would still be coherent with my long investment horizon . I did some research and figured 3 ETFs that would give me the kind of exposure I feel most comfortable with but while going through my portfolio ready to do my monthly purchase I realised the commission fee is on the higher end 34€ per purchase IBKR . The three ETFs are XUSA VWRA and DGRW and purchasing once a month will erode a portion of my cash in a way I ’ m not_too comfortable with . Question is is it better to do bulk purchases 12 per year even if I don ’ t like cash idling in my account or is there a set of ETFs which will do that same job without having such commission fee My main concept is to have a limited exposure to US markets between 3545 % of my portfolio . I have mutual funds on the side which are 100 % focused on Asia and emerging markets and those are held with my bank so technically not_part of this portfolio . Any question that can be useful to have a more “ tailored ” response is greatly appreciated . Happy 2026"

      "selftext": "I’ve been looking into TeamViewer AG following the recent price correction, and I believe the market is significantly mispricing this asset. While often dismissed as \"legacy remote support software,\" the underlying financials tell a very different story. 1. Exceptional Profitability Unlike many growth-tech companies, TeamViewer is a cash cow. In 2025, the company maintained an adjusted EBITDA margin of \\~46%. They are consistently generating high free cash flow, which they are aggressively using for share buybacks, effectively increasing earnings per share for remaining holders. 2. Financial Performance (Latest Data) • Revenue Growth: Q3 2025 revenue hit €192M, showing resilience despite a challenging macro environment. Full-year revenue is guided toward €778M - €797M. • Enterprise Pivot: The focus on Enterprise solutions is paying off, with that segment growing 18%. This indicates a successful transition from a consumer/SMB tool to a mission-critical industrial platform (AR/IoT). • Valuation: At current levels, the stock trades at an EV/EBITDA of roughly 7.5x. For a software company with these margins and a leading global brand, this is an entry point usually reserved for distressed industries. 3. The \"Dip\" Opportunity The recent 20% sell-off was triggered by a slight narrowing of ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) guidance. In my view, this is a massive overreaction. The core business remains robust, and the company’s expansion into \"Frontline\" (augmented reality for industrial workers) provides a long-term growth catalyst that isn't priced in. Conclusion: TeamViewer is currently priced like a company in terminal decline, yet its margins and enterprise growth suggest a healthy, dominant player. For value-oriented investors looking for tech exposure without the \"bubble\" multiples, $TMV offers a compelling risk/reward profile.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been looking into TeamViewer AG following the recent price correction and I believe the market is significantly mispricing this asset . While often dismissed as legacy remote support software the underlying financials tell a very different story . 1 . Exceptional Profitability Unlike many growthtech companies TeamViewer is a cash cow . In 2025 the company maintained an adjusted EBITDA margin of 46 % . They are consistently generating high free cash flow which they are aggressively using for share buybacks effectively increasing earnings per share for remaining holders . 2 . Financial Performance Latest Data • Revenue Growth Q3 2025 revenue hit €192M showing resilience despite a challenging macro environment . Fullyear revenue is guided toward €778M €797M . • Enterprise Pivot The focus on Enterprise solutions is paying off with that segment growing 18 % . This indicates a successful transition from a consumerSMB tool to a missioncritical industrial platform ARIoT . • Valuation At current levels the stock trades at an EVEBITDA of roughly 7.5x . For a software company with these margins and a leading global brand this is an entry point usually reserved for distressed industries . 3 . The Dip Opportunity The recent 20 % selloff was triggered by a slight narrowing of ARR Annual Recurring Revenue guidance . In my view this is a massive overreaction . The core business remains robust and the company ’ s expansion into Frontline augmented reality for industrial workers provides a longterm growth catalyst that isnt priced in . Conclusion TeamViewer is currently priced like a company in terminal decline yet its margins and enterprise growth suggest a healthy dominant player . For valueoriented investors looking for tech exposure without the bubble multiples $ TMV offers a compelling riskreward profile ."

I know growth will be slow but will there be growth especially if VZ is undervalued? It definitely seems like a good stock to park money in.

My current plan is to invest \\~3/5 in secure ETFs and very stable stocks like VTI, VOO, QQQM, MSFT, etc., \\~1/5 in bonds and stable commodities like gold, and use the other 1/5 to have some fun with individual stocks and a bit of day trading (not actually expecting to beat the market). I don't even want to touch shorts, options, or futures until I'm *much* more knowledgeable and financially stable. Also, I bought $100 of btc, decided it was stupid, and sold at a 30 cent loss. I've heard a lot of negatives about Robinhood, so I was wondering if I should keep the money there or transfer it to something else like Fidelity. I do like the 3.5% interest on cash, but if there's something better, I want to use that. Also, any notes on my investment strategy? Thanks! Mods, feel free to remove if you feel this breaks rule 4. Note: I already switched my account from margin to cash.",

I do like the 3.5 % interest on cash but if theres something better I want to use that . Also any notes on my investment strategy Thanks Mods feel free to remove if you feel this breaks rule 4 . Note I already switched my account from margin to cash ."

Granted, I am newer (I’ve been dabbling here and there but decided to actually take my finances into my own hands) so I don’t know if there’s something else I may be interested in later. I have (or had) a Fidelity account a while ago just never invested anything in it. I ask this because I’ve seen many from this forum say their bond account isn’t really trust worthy. Also, unless I read wrong I believe they only have up to $50,000 in securities insured, which is something I’m not a fan of. I had planned to put $200/week into my account for investing so I’d get to that point in a few years. I want to make sure I’m covered, does anyone have experience with that? Am I safe or just transfer it over to Fidelity? Can I just move my securities over to Fidelity from Public or would I have to cash out? Thanks!",

I have or had a Fidelity account a while ago just never_invested anything in it . I ask this because I ’ ve seen many from this forum say their bond account isn ’ t really trust worthy . Also unless I read wrong I believe they only have up to $ 50000 in securities insured which is something I ’ m not_a fan of . I had planned to put $ 200week into my account for investing so I ’ d get to that point in a few years . I want to make sure I ’ m covered does anyone have experience with that Am I safe or just transfer it over to Fidelity Can I just move my securities over to Fidelity from Public or would I have to cash out Thanks"

      "selftext": "Most say ETF 80:20 Single stocks split. But if you are strongly convicted in a stock, that just feels like diluting the gains, when you could have just gone all out one the single stocks. But then again you could end up like intel stock guy. But then again you could end up like nvidia stock guy. How do you solve this dilemma? i mean it is a gamble at the end of the day, regardless of how strongly you feel about a stock, but at same time, taking this gamble feels worth it because if it does work it means you just fast-forwarded a few years and got bigger rewards, but then i guess if it fails you''ve gone backwards in time a few years but honestly this is a lot of buts in decision making. Or you could just not get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds. in short, seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy, like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 1-3 blue chip stocks",

But if you are strongly convicted in a stock that just feels like diluting the gains when you could have just gone all out one the single stocks . But then again you could end up like intel stock guy . But then again you could end up like nvidia stock guy . How do you solve this dilemma i mean it is a gamble at the end of the day regardless of how strongly you feel about a stock but at same time taking this gamble feels worth it because if it does work it means you just fastforwarded a few years and got bigger rewards but then i guess if it fails youve gone backwards in time a few years but honestly this is a lot of buts in decision making . Or you could just not_get the greed best of you and just accumulate wealth in index funds . in short seeing people just buy some blue chip stocks and end up with massive returns has made me jealous and question my own etf strategy like why am i wasting time when i could have just bought 13 blue chip stocks"

      "selftext": "This probably isn't your typical penny stock. Because it's actually a deep value-play. And it probably won't be a quick mover either...unless it gets acquired (which I believe it will)....but more on that later. What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry. Vitamins/supplements/nutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future. An aging population and a friendly administration to non-pharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead. The company currently trades at a $9.6m market cap. They have $4.7m in cash and 0 debt, giving us an enterprise value of $4.9m. Fiscal 2025 revenue (ending June 30th) was $54.3m, compared to $50.3m in the year ago period. Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here, but on aggregate this is a growing business. **The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue. That's undervalued clue #1** The company has trailing 12-month EBITDA of $2m. On an **EV/EBITDA basis this is 2.4x. That's undervalued clue #2** Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt. The company's inventory is $10.5m, which is more than the current market cap of the company. **Simply put, they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for. That's undervalued clue #3** The hidden value here is really in their real estate. They only have their entire property & equipment valued at $1.8m. This is despite owning a 40,000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate. Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $8-10m range. **The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what it's actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company. That's undervalued clue #4** Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet. The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value. **Simply put, the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for, without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business. That's undervalued clue #5.** I've always tried to align myself with people smarter than me. And the fact that the stock is 40% owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign. The DeSantis family, thru CDS holdings, control just over 13m shares, or about 43% of the stock. Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP. William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP, and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius. It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values. I'm sure they're looking at the same numbers I'm looking at, and realize the company's assets are probably worth around $1/share (current share price is in the low $0.30s). And that's valuing the company's profitable operations at $0. We're just talking assets here. **Risks:** As with most penny stocks, things are never going to be perfect. You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward. The main risk here is with customer concentration. The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for, Life Extension and Herbalife. Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue, and Herbalife is around 25%. These are multi-decade relationships so I'd weight the probability of losing these customers as low, but it's still a risk. INBP has been in business for over 50 years, so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry. **Conclusion**: It's not often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value. And not just a little below, INBP is 50% below net asset value. And probably more like 70% below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate. There's a lot of margin for error here, and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires. I think it's a matter of when, and not if, the company is acquired. Disclosure: Long",

      "selftext_processed": "This probably isnt your typical penny stock . Because its actually a deep valueplay . And it probably wont be a quick mover either ... unless it gets acquired which I believe it will .... but more on that later . What we have here is a company in a predictable and growing industry . Vitaminssupplementsnutraceuticals will be having tailwinds for the foreseeable future . An aging population and a friendly administration to nonpharmaceuticals will provide needed fuel to continue stable growth into the years ahead . The company currently trades at a $ 9.6m market cap . They have $ 4.7m in cash and 0 debt giving us an enterprise value of $ 4.9m . Fiscal 2025 revenue ending June 30th was $ 54.3m compared to $ 50.3m in the year ago period . Quarterly revenue can be a bit lumpy here but on aggregate this is a growing business . The stock currently trades for just 0.1x revenue . Thats undervalued clue 1 The company has trailing 12month EBITDA of $ 2m . On an EVEBITDA basis this is 2.4x . Thats undervalued clue 2 Balance sheet is solid with the aforementioned cash pile and 0 debt . The companys inventory is $ 10.5m which is more than the current market cap of the company . Simply put they could close their doors tomorrow and sell their inventory for more than the entire company is currently trading for . Thats undervalued clue 3 The hidden value here is really in their real estate . They only have their entire property equipment valued at $ 1.8m . This is despite owning a 40000 sq ft manufacturing facility in prime New Jersey real estate . Comps in the area would value this on the secondary market in the $ 810m range . The difference between what they have their real estate on the books for and what its actually worth is nearly more than the entire market cap of the company . Thats undervalued clue 4 Even with the real estate undervalued on the balance sheet . The net tangible assets of the company are still twice the current trading value . Simply put the company could be liquidated today for twice what it is selling for without assigning any value to the profitable operations of the business . Thats undervalued clue 5 . Ive always tried to align myself with people smarter than me . And the fact that the stock is 40 % owned by the billionaire founders of Celsius energy drinks is probably a good sign . The DeSantis family thru CDS holdings control just over 13m shares or about 43 % of the stock . Damon DeSantis is on the Board of Directors of both Celsius and INBP . William Milmoe is on the Board of INBP and Chairman Emeritus of Celsius . It would stand to reason that they will eventually just take this company private at a significant premium to current values . Im sure theyre looking at the same numbers Im looking at and realize the companys assets are probably worth around $ 1share current share price is in the low $ 0.30s . And thats valuing the companys profitable operations at $ 0 . Were just talking assets here . Risks As with most penny stocks things are never_going to be perfect . You have to be able to accept some risk for potential reward . The main risk here is with customer concentration . The company has 2 main customers to whom they manufacture and distribute for Life Extension and Herbalife . Life Extension makes up the majority of revenue and Herbalife is around 25 % . These are multidecade relationships so Id weight the probability of losing these customers as low but its still a risk . INBP has been in business for over 50 years so they have longstanding relationships with many of the biggest players in the supplement industry . Conclusion Its not_often you see a profitable company trading below net asset value . And not_just a little below INBP is 50 % below net asset value . And probably more like 70 % below net asset value if you consider their undervalued real estate . Theres a lot of margin for error here and I like aligning my investment with that of billionaires . I think its a matter of when and not_if the company is acquired . Disclosure Long"

      "selftext": "With CES 2026 happening next week I thought it would be a good time to discuss what people’s favourite robotic stocks are. Typically during the CES event there is a lot of hype around robotics and some of the largest companies discuss and show off the latest and upcoming developments in the robotics industry. My personal favourites right now are RR (Richtech Robotics) and SERV (Serve Robotics). Richtech will be showing off their latest robots at CES next week. They have a wide range of robots that will service various sectors and have partnerships with Nvidia. Serve robotics is mainly focused on food delivery but have deals already with major food delivery companies. What are your favourites and how do you think the robotics sector will do this year? There seems to be growing hype around Robotics recently and the change it can have in various sectors.",

Typically during the CES event there is a lot of hype around robotics and some of the largest companies discuss and show off the latest and upcoming developments in the robotics industry . My personal favourites right now are RR Richtech Robotics and SERV Serve Robotics . Richtech will be showing off their latest robots at CES next week . They have a wide range of robots that will service various sectors and have partnerships with Nvidia . Serve robotics is mainly focused on food delivery but have deals already with major food delivery companies . What are your favourites and how do you think the robotics sector will do this year There seems to be growing hype around Robotics recently and the change it can have in various sectors ."

      "selftext": "Thoughts on agency MREITs with 12-20% yield like AGNC, NLY, DX, ORC, TWO, ARR etc., (and mortgage companies like RKT, LDI, UWMC.) My basic thesis is below but I’d like outside opinions since every friend I have from working in the mortgage industry has no opinions. Please tell me where I am wrong. Mortgages companies and Mortgage REITS (probably the best risk adjusted value niche in the market) • ⁠It affects so many people (and therefore our justifiably unpopular president’s popularity leading into midterms) and is driven by policy and regulation that the executive branch largely has control over. Trump has more • ⁠Mortgage spreads are historically wide when corporate spreads (ex ORCL) are tight • ⁠Deregulation for mortgages and banking • ⁠Lower Capital requirements means more lending • ⁠Funding/repo rates are gonna drop more with the federal • ⁠LT rates anchored with largest treasury buybacks of all time • ⁠MREITs yield 12-20% dividends so when rates fall and will look even more attractive on a relative basis. Meanwhile their higher net interest spread will make them more profitable and they should continue to appreciate. • ⁠Financial/Mortgage companies are full of paper pushers who do countless repetitive tasks whose jobs are the most easily replaced with AI. No edge AI sensors or insane computational energy needed for how straightforward these are. Headcount expense can plummet. Outside catalyst bet: - Declaring housing an emergency, Trump can order his new lackey at the fed is to start to buy mortgage bonds in some form of QE tightening spreads. Potential Risk - People may not want to move cuz of their mortgage rates and material costs can rise with the inevitable “run it hot” inflation. Also, K shaped economy and labor weakness.",

This is highly speculative, and the prices assumes substantial growth, but the sky is the limit for this one. To quote its business summary: “Symbotic Inc., an automation technology company, develops technologies to enhance operating efficiencies in modern warehouses. The company automates the processing of pallets, cases, and individual items in warehouses. Its systems enhance operations at the front end of the supply chain.” I strongly recommend you looks the video at their website to understand what they do. I love their products! But, the thing I like even more is their customer list. It may be short but it is growing and the additions are trend setters that you have to respect. The list includes: Walmart Target Albertsons They have a joint venture with SoftBank which is called GreenBox. This provides warehouse automation as a service; therefore, the customer does not have to incur upfront costs. They recently picked up Medline as a client. Medline has connections with Blackstone, Carlyle Group, and Hillman &Friedman. This has the product and connections to go through the roof! This is not a recommendation, draw your own conclusions.",

      "selftext": "I know this question gets asked here almost daily and the group leans strongly towards investing right away into an index fund. However, from a portfolio allocation standpoint, if the smartest investors such as Berkshire Hathaway are keeping a lot of cash for a downturn, why shouldn’t retail investors hold a bigger cash position now? See below article on Berkshire I am NOT talking about silly things such as selling all stocks or YOLOing into a meme stock, but tactically increasing cash allocation for 3-6 months after S&P 500 has gone up almost 80% cumulatively in the last three years. Specially if you have new money now, would you invest all at once into S&P index at the current valuation or keep more cash position? Edit: clarified that I am not debating VOO and chill approach, which I think is the right strategy for most. My question is about investing a large cash position immediately or holding cash for 3-6 months.",

However from a portfolio allocation standpoint if the smartest investors such as Berkshire Hathaway are keeping a lot of cash for a downturn why shouldn ’ t retail investors hold a bigger cash position now See below article on Berkshire I am NOT_talking about silly things such as selling all stocks or YOLOing into a meme stock but tactically increasing cash allocation for 36 months after SP 500 has gone up almost 80 % cumulatively in the last three years . Specially if you have new money now would you invest all at once into SP index at the current valuation or keep more cash position Edit clarified that I am not_debating VOO and chill approach which I think is the right strategy for most . My question is about investing a large cash position immediately or holding cash for 36 months ."

      "selftext": "Happy New Year, everyone. After the frenzy of 2025 subsided, 2026 feels entirely different now. The once dominant Mag7 companies have begun to diverge. The market no longer buys into so called AI potential; instead, it focuses on who can actually deliver cash flow from AI monetization. These are the three stocks I'm focusing on in 2026: 1. GOOG: I know many find Google boring. But with Gemini 3.0's deep integration and Google Cloud's growth outpacing peers, they've proven the skeptics wrong. Their AI Agent monetization within Workspace will be this year's big surprise. Crucially, compared to Microsoft or Nvidia, Google remains relatively “cheaply” valued. 2. VRT: If 2024-2025 was the year of chips, then 2026 is the year of power grids. Every data center built today requires top tier cooling and power management, and Vertiv is the undisputed leader in this space. As long as tech giants keep pouring hundreds of billions into infrastructure, VRT will keep raking in profits. This is a classic “shovel business” no matter which AI model wins, they'll need its liquid cooling tech. 3. VRTX: Their cystic fibrosis drug faces virtually no competition, and their CRISPR gene editing pipeline is entering harvest mode. In years of heightened tech stock volatility, growth stocks like VRTX with deep moats and resilience to economic cycles can significantly stabilize portfolios. My current strategy is to steer clear of pure hardware hype and focus on companies controlling infrastructure or vertical applications with exceptionally high margins. Which investments do you see as valuable by 2026? This article is for informational purposes only. Invest with caution!",

Not huge, but defense money is still flowing and it feels like a hint where big players might be putting cash early 2026. I’ve only got a small position, not chasing spikes, but watching volume and big-money moves; if it dips, I might add. Tech is wild semiconductors and AI everywhere but I’m sticking to real signals: contracts, earnings previews, geopolitics. What do y’all think? Just noise, or a reason LMT and other defense names are worth watching? Drop your thoughts and positions.",

Generally, it’s supposed to be last 3 days of 2025 going into first two days of 2026 (so technically, we still have tomorrow) Sell side research is pointing to the Fed, geopolitics, AI’s circular financing (Oracle); high P/E Multiples; what are your thoughts as to why? Here’s some of what I’ve seen from reading some sell-side reports: Federal Reserve: The Fed minutes that were released this week show mixed guidance on number and votes from FOMC members on future rate hikes. Geopolitics: Venezuela, China, etc. Trade War and tariffs Supreme Court: It’s expected that Supreme Court will strike down the administrations tariffs Yields: Treas yields are still high because there’s an expectation the next Fed chair will be light on combatting inflation Economic data: Govt shutdown led to low trust in data What are your thoughts?",

Not huge, but defense money is still flowing and it feels like a hint where big players might be putting cash early 2026. I’ve only got a small position, not chasing spikes, but watching volume and big-money moves; if it dips, I might add. Tech is wild semiconductors and AI everywhere but I’m sticking to real signals: contracts, earnings previews, geopolitics. What do y’all think? Just noise, or a reason LMT and other defense names are worth watching? Drop your thoughts and positions.",

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I'm relatively new to investing, and with a background in geopolitics, I decided to go pretty hard (\\~25% of my portfolio) on MPC, the largest oil refinery in the US, about a month ago. Sorta bought the peak. The logic was as follows: MPC is the largest petroleum refiner in the US. By that point it was up \\~25% YTD. 293% 5 years. Generally speaking, oil is a finite resource, and even if the world switches to renewable energy, petroleum-related products are going to remain mandatory. (asphalt, bitumen etc). As for MPC specifically, I thought it was uniquely positioned to benefit from the geopolitical situations unfolding. First of all, many of its refineries are located on the Gulf Coast, primed to receive Venezuelan crude. In fact, they were built *specifically for it*. They are the best suited refiner for sour, heavy crude, which is the vast majority of what Venezuela has. Secondly, they're the only refiner that's expanding its factories to accommodate more volume. And lastly, they've been regularly and consistently buying back shares, suggesting high confidence in the business from the company side. Geopolitically speaking, I figured MPC should benefit from the conflict no matter how it ends. When Venezuela concedes and the US gains access to VE crude, MPC wins the most because it can import raw materials at premium prices. And it **will** end that way, based on the fact that Maduro has **already** offered the US premium access to its oil reserves, and Trump has refused. This means that the only question is **how** preferential US access will be to VE crude, not whether or not it will obtain it. The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation, right? Source: [ That being said, I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down, over speculations of oversupply. But MPC is a *buyer* of oil, not a seller. The core products of MPC, like Diesel and distillates, are seeing the exact opposite. There's a supply *squeeze* in the US, not a glut. All that being said, if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute, could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month? And whether it makes sense to attempt to DCA?",

The fact that it may take a month or a year should be irrelevant to market speculation right Source That being said I understand that the global prices of oil have gone down over speculations of oversupply . But MPC is a buyer of oil not_a seller . The core products of MPC like Diesel and distillates are seeing the exact opposite . Theres a supply squeeze in the US not_a glut . All that being said if anyone has the patience to look into it for a hot minute could you please explain to me why the stock tanked so hard in the last month And whether it makes sense to attempt to DCA"

      "selftext": "I’m a Canadian DIY investor managing my own portfolio and investing an additional $1,500–$2,000 weekly, mostly into US equities. I’m not looking for a financial advisor. Instead, I’m looking for a paid online service that offers: • Clear buy/sell guidance • Model portfolios • ETF recommendations • Rules‑based or systematic frameworks I’m willing to spend up to ~$1,000/year if the service provides real value. My timeline: • Wife has a ~$70K pension starting in ~5 years • I’m targeting retirement in 6–8 years There are tons of newsletters and advisory platforms out there, but I’m trying to narrow down which ones are actually worth paying for. Which online services do you recommend for someone who wants structured guidance but still wants to stay fully DIY? Thanks in advance for your advice *** I understand that there are no service that are 100% accurate. I have many US stocks and really unsure what to keep, what to sell… I am looking at different services like SeekingAlpha, Morningstar, … but comments / reviews are all over the map. Looking for any advice from you folks that have had some success with similar service ***",

The only thing I remember in my quick search was that there are mainly 2 tipes of investing: 1)The \"Go big or go home\" where you aim for a big turnout but are taking a bigger risk 2)The \"Slow and steady\" where the turnout may be significantly less, but the risk comes down as well. What I'm asking is some tips on about everything I've said, corrections if even the 2 things I've written are wrong as well, recommendations on how or if to start (based on how much I have as well if interested) And lastly, happy new year",

      "selftext": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading - please be aware that social media platform like Reddit, Discord, etc. can be a vector for scams and fraud. Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious. Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams. - do not assume that an offer to \"help\" is legitimate. There are many dozens of types of scams - a list of scam types can be found in r/scams in the master list here: [/r/Scams Common Scam Master]( 1. Good explanation of pig-buthering here - [Pig butchering - how to spot]( 2. Legitimate investment advisors do not use WhatApp, Telegram, Discord, etc. to provide tips. In the US - it is against regulation - specifically SEC Rule 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 3110. For example - brokers in the US that use social media for support do not offer investment advice. 3. It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams. It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else. 4. Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media - bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype. You can sometimes identify if it's a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history. Often you will see that the account has posted nothing related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks. 5. One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd. Those are all signs of stock promotion. 6. Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake. If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser, be wary. Depending on where you live - you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser. Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered. United States - check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here - [ You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here - [ United Kingdom - Financial Conduct Authority - [ \\- a warning list of fake companies can be found here - [ Canada - CIRO - [ For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pump-and-dumps - one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with - you can find the AMA here - [ If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam. Be aware of the following: 1. Do not send more money. Do not provide additional banking or credit card information. 2. It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to \"recover\" funds for payment. This is a common follow-up scam. Law enforcement will never ask for money. 3. If a login account was created. The password used is compromised. Change all passwords that are used. The password will be shared and sold to other scammers. 4. If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer - report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company.",

      "selftext_processed": "For those new to Reddit and to investing and trading please be aware that social media platform like Reddit Discord etc . can be a vector for scams and fraud . Offers to DM should be viewed as suspicious . Social media platforms continue to be a common method to recruit new investors to scams . do not_assume that an offer to help is legitimate . There are many dozens of types of scams a list of scam types can be found in rscams in the master list here rScams Common Scam Master 1 . Good explanation of pigbuthering here Pig butchering how to spot 2 . Legitimate investment advisors do not_use WhatApp Telegram Discord etc . to provide tips . In the US it is against regulation specifically SEC Rule 17a4 and FINRA Rule 3110 . For example brokers in the US that use social media for support do not_offer investment advice . 3 . It is common for bots and malicious actors on Discord to impersonate Reddit and Discord mods to distribute their scams . It is possible to create a Discord profile which appears similar to someone else . 4 . Pump and dump of stocks are common on social media bots or stock promoters who are seeking to profit from pumping a stock or to create hype . You can sometimes identify if its a bot or promoter simply by looking at the posters comment and post history . Often you will see that the account has posted nothing_related to investing or trading but suddenly there is the same or varying versions of comments on one or two specific stocks . 5 . One other way to recognize suspicious posts is if the OP never_engages in a discussion on comments and questions in the thread on their own dd . Those are all signs of stock promotion . 6 . Offers to mirror trade and teach you how to trade are usually fake . If you receive private solicitations to open accounts at a broker or investment adviser be wary . Depending on where you live you can verify the legitimacy of a broker or investment adviser . Most countries have legal requirements for investment advisors and brokers to be registered . United States check the registration status of a broker at the FINRA web site here You can check disclosures for investment advisers at the SEC IAPD web site here United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority a warning list of fake companies can be found here Canada CIRO For those interested in understanding a little more about stock promoting and pumpanddumps one of the mods provided an AMA 15 years ago about a penny stock pump operation that he unwittingly became associated with you can find the AMA here If you believe that you or someone has been the victim of a trading or investing scam . Be aware of the following 1 . Do not_send more money . Do not_provide additional banking or credit card information . 2 . It is common to be contacted by additional scammers who may pretend to be law enforcement or private services to offer to recover funds for payment . This is a common followup scam . Law enforcement will never_ask for money . 3 . If a login account was created . The password used is compromised . Change all passwords that are used . The password will be shared and sold to other scammers . 4 . If payment was sent via a credit card or bank transfer report the transfers as fraud to your bank or credit card company ."

      "title": "Fidelity Managed FidFolios - Real Numbers After ~ 13 Months",
      "selftext": "Hi All, If you ever talked to a Fidelity advisor, one of their products like the FidFolio was probably shoved in your face. They claim it will save you money due to tax loss harvesting, so I put it to the test so you don't have to. Here is my honest review of how it did: Fidelity Managed FidFolios®: U.S. Total Market Index Initial Investment - $50,574.14 made on 11/27/2024. No additonal investment was mode. Current Valve (as of 1/1/26) - $56,718.84 Total tax loss harvesting - $6,933.11 If I had just invested directly into VTI with the same initial investment and reinvested all the dividends, I would actually have $57,740.65 sitting in my account. That is a difference of $1,021.81. However, with tax loss harvesting and considering my tax bracket to be 24% I should have actually saved $1,663.95 in federal taxes alone. So in theory I'm actually ahead by $642.14, which isn't a lot, but the system is working. The higher your tax rate the more this product would benefit you. Two negatives though: 1. I did find kind of annoying is that Fidelity reports my tax savings to be $2,482.05 with a giant asterick. That asterick is the assumption is that I'm in the 35% tax bracket! I find this to be extremly dishonest from Fidelity since they know exactly what my income is. 2. The money is not as liquid as I thought it would be. Actually from what I understand I would have to call Fidelity first to sell the securities within the account into cash before I can transfter it out. I don't mind the few days delay in this type of process, but I would rather do this from the app or website without having to talk to someone on the phone to get access to my money. 3. Fidelity is pushing the FidFolios product VERY HARD. This generally makes me skeptical and raises my guard. Are they making a commission on this? If the product performs better than other investment vehicles, it will sell itself like hot cakes! At the moment this product does seem to perform better than just investing directly into VTI. However, very marginally! Actually, $642.14 is just 1.1% of the overall value. If you consider state income tax burdens and/or have a higher tax rate your results may be more positive. So what do you think - VTI and chill or keep monitoring the FidFolios product?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi All If you ever talked to a Fidelity advisor one of their products like the FidFolio was probably shoved in your face . They claim it will save you money due to tax loss harvesting so I put it to the test so you dont have to . Here is my honest review of how it did Fidelity Managed FidFolios® U.S. Total Market Index Initial Investment $ 50574.14 made on 11272024 . No_additonal investment was mode . Current Valve as of 1126 $ 56718.84 Total tax loss harvesting $ 6933.11 If I had just invested directly into VTI with the same initial investment and reinvested all the dividends I would actually have $ 57740.65 sitting in my account . That is a difference of $ 1021.81 . However with tax loss harvesting and considering my tax bracket to be 24 % I should have actually saved $ 1663.95 in federal taxes alone . So in theory Im actually ahead by $ 642.14 which isnt a lot but the system is working . The higher your tax rate the more this product would benefit you . Two negatives though 1 . I did find kind of annoying is that Fidelity reports my tax savings to be $ 2482.05 with a giant asterick . That asterick is the assumption is that Im in the 35 % tax bracket I find this to be extremly dishonest from Fidelity since they know exactly what my income is . 2 . The money is not_as liquid as I thought it would be . Actually from what I understand I would have to call Fidelity first to sell the securities within the account into cash before I can transfter it out . I dont mind the few days delay in this type of process but I would rather do this from the app or website without having to talk to someone on the phone to get access to my money . 3 . Fidelity is pushing the FidFolios product VERY HARD . This generally makes me skeptical and raises my guard . Are they making a commission on this If the product performs better than other investment vehicles it will sell itself like hot cakes At the moment this product does seem to perform better than just investing directly into VTI . However very marginally Actually $ 642.14 is just 1.1 % of the overall value . If you consider state income tax burdens andor have a higher tax rate your results may be more positive . So what do you think VTI and chill or keep monitoring the FidFolios product"

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |CRSP US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |CRSP US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |CRSP US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |CRSP US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets Index|\\+33.57%| |MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index|\\+32.39%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "Football is the most-watched event in the United States. Over the next month, the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape. Last year, seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games. The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each. Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest. Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada. Up until 2018, Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘enjoy’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game. On May 14, 2018, the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). By doing so, it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting. Today, thirty-eight states permit sports wagering in their areas. Now, another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray. They are called prediction markets. Over the last year, the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports, politics, business, weather, travel, and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption. The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events, and specifically football. Why does this matter for the investment world? Increasingly, the public uses its money to try to make a profit. Traditionally, the investment world was the domain where that took place. Over the last twenty years, as markets have become digitized, custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices, especially smartphones. Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity. If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options, levered ETFs, levered ETFs on single stocks, and ETFs related to any geography or activity, one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are, at the very least, blurring. The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi. Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products. In October of 2025, Polymarket received a $2 billion investment at a $9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) to provide access to prediction products for institutions. Kalshi, the leader in global prediction markets with a 60% share and annual trading volume of over $50 billion, obtained $300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia, Andreesen-Horwitz, A16z, and Paradigm. Interestingly, one of the best-performing stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood, the online broker. When any entity suddenly finds a one-hundred-million-dollar run-rate business in less than a year, especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues, investors react favorably. As the prediction entities have gained adoption, the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically. More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas, the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6% in 2025 (perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026?) []( [Share](%%share_url%%) Whenever there is a competitive alternative, incumbents will respond to protect their market share. FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association. The following week, both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms (in partnership with the CME Group, the publicly traded futures exchange). Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry. From a regulatory standpoint, the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Currently, it views the product as a financial derivative and not gambling. Anti-fraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘clarify’ the legal boundaries. In Congress, our on-the-ball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members (The ex-madame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember). So how should investors view this whole situation? The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting. However, betting and gambling are different. In gaming, there is a definite outcome, and the only thing one owns is the chance that one’s prediction, wager, hand, throw of the dice, or pull of the machine turns out correctly. When one invests, you own an entity that has assets and liabilities. In most cases, those assets and liabilities form operating businesses. The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity. From my perspective, and I have written this on numerous occasions, my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino. The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges, suppliers of gaming, and some underlying offshoot of both. Yes, Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged. It will be interesting to see how this evolves, and I certainly will be paying attention.",

      "selftext_processed": "Football is the mostwatched event in the United States . Over the next month the NFL and College Football Championship Series will likely attract huge ratings across the streaming and cable landscape . Last year seven of the top ten most viewed cable television shows in December were from college football games . The NFL championship games in January of 2025 attracted nearly fifty million viewers each . Linked to these events is the ability to make a wager on outcomes or activity in the contest . Sports betting used to be confined to the state of Nevada . Up until 2018 Las Vegas was the place where people would go if they wanted to ‘ enjoy ’ the thrill of watching and betting on a football game . On May 14 2018 the Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act PASPA . By doing so it allowed individual states to legalize and regulate sports betting . Today thirtyeight states permit sports wagering in their areas . Now another contender to eat into the gaming market has entered the fray . They are called prediction markets . Over the last year the ability to make markets on events with outcomes in sports politics business weather travel and anything you can imagine has gained surprising adoption . The overwhelming majority of prediction volumes involve sporting events and specifically football . Why does this matter for the investment world Increasingly the public uses its money to try to make a profit . Traditionally the investment world was the domain where that took place . Over the last twenty years as markets have become digitized custodians and exchanges created products that provide easy access through various electronic devices especially smartphones . Custodians like Interactive Brokers and Robinhood offer prediction markets to customers for this type of activity . If one looks at the explosion of related instruments like weekly options levered ETFs levered ETFs on single stocks and ETFs related to any geography or activity one can legitimately argue that the lines between investing and gambling are at the very least blurring . The two largest entities in prediction markets are Polymarket and Kalshi . Both have partnerships with custodians and exchanges to offer prediction products . In October of 2025 Polymarket received a $ 2 billion investment at a $ 9 billion valuation from the Intercontinental Exchange ICE to provide access to prediction products for institutions . Kalshi the leader in global prediction markets with a 60 % share and annual trading volume of over $ 50 billion obtained $ 300 million from large venture capitalists Sequoia AndreesenHorwitz A16z and Paradigm . Interestingly one of the bestperforming stocks across all markets over the last few years is Robinhood the online broker . When any entity suddenly finds a onehundredmilliondollar runrate business in less than a year especially one with massive profit margins and what appears to be numerous growth avenues investors react favorably . As the prediction entities have gained adoption the largest publicly traded sports betting entities like FanDuel and DraftKings have seen their values drop dramatically . More problematic for my hometown of Las Vegas the number of visitors traveling to our city is estimated to decline by 6 % in 2025 perhaps one would like to predict that in 2026 Share % % share_url % % Whenever there is a competitive alternative incumbents will respond to protect their market share . FanDuel and DraftKings recently quit the American Gaming Association . The following week both entities decided to offer prediction markets on their platforms in partnership with the CME Group the publicly traded futures exchange . Many of the publicly traded casino entities have also seen their values drop over the last year as live gaming is seen as a stagnant industry . From a regulatory standpoint the oversight of prediction products has been left to the Commodities Futures Trading Commission CFTC . Currently it views the product as a financial derivative and not_gambling . Antifraud and fair market practices are statutes that states are eyeing to ‘ clarify ’ the legal boundaries . In Congress our ontheball representatives are increasingly noticing the issue as they attempt to pass a bill to prevent equity investment by its own members The exmadame speaker of the house has done well investing the last I remember . So how should investors view this whole situation The ability to weigh risk and reward is at the heart of investing and applicable to sports betting . However betting and gambling are different . In gaming there is a definite outcome and the only thing one owns is the chance that one ’ s prediction wager hand throw of the dice or pull of the machine turns out correctly . When one invests you own an entity that has assets and liabilities . In most cases those assets and liabilities form operating businesses . The success of the entity to generate profits from its assets and then grow them determines the value of the underlying entity . From my perspective and I have written this on numerous occasions my preferred way to make money with casinos is to own equity of the casino . The principle can be applied to the custodians and exchanges suppliers of gaming and some underlying offshoot of both . Yes Las Vegas and the casino industry are being challenged . It will be interesting to see how this evolves and I certainly will be paying attention ."

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 saw another strong year for US equities. Large cap and growth again led the way, with the Nasdaq 100 (+21.24% vs. +17.88% for S&P 500) again the winner among the benchmark indices. However, this year saw significant outperformance in both international developed (+31.85%) and emerging (+33.57%) markets. Precious metals such as gold (+64.33%) and silver (+145.88%) saw explosive returns not seen since 1979. Not all risk assets performed strongly, as despite considerable tailwinds to start the year, Bitcoin (-6.18%) and Ethereum (-11.09%) ended 2025 in the negative. This year saw aggregate bonds (+7.08%) finally deliver solid returns with the US federal reserve cutting rates in the setting of labor market weakness. |Index|Total Returns (2025)| |:-|:-| |S&P 500|\\+17.88%| |Nasdaq 100|\\+21.24%| |Russell 2000|\\+12.81%| |Dow Jones Industrial Average|\\+14.92%| |CRSP US Large Cap Growth|\\+19.45%| |CRSP US Large Cap Value|\\+15.31%| |CRSP US Small Cap Growth|\\+8.57%| |CRSP US Small Cap Value|\\+9.16%| |MSCI USA Index|\\+17.31%| |MSCI World ex-USA Index|\\+31.85%| |MSCI Emerging Markets Index|\\+33.57%| |MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index|\\+32.39%| |MSCI All Country World Index|\\+22.34%| |Gold|\\+64.33%| |Silver|\\+145.88%| |Bitcoin|(-6.18%)| |Ethereum|(-11.09%)| |Bonds|\\+7.08%| |Treasuries|\\+4.27%| As far as individual factors, despite all the talk about momentum driving US markets, it was growth that ended up leading the way, just as it has for much of the last 15 years. Internationally, in developed ex-US markets, value continued to massively outperform. However, despite the value premium historically being much stronger in emerging markets, in 2025, we saw this premium disappear--likely, this can be attributed to the rise of AI giants in China, Taiwan, and South Korea, which collectively make up nearly 60% of the MSCI Emerging Markets index. |MSCI|Geography|Total|Growth|Value|Quality|Momentum| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |MSCI USA|United States|[\\+17.31%](|[\\+20.93%](|[\\+12.97%](|[\\+15.88%](|[\\+17.34%](| |MSCI World ex-USA|Developed ex-USA|[\\+31.85%](|[\\+21.94%](|[\\+42.23%](|[\\+20.79%](|[\\+34.58%](| |MSCI Emerging Markets|Emerging Markets|[\\+33.57%](|[\\+34.30%](|[\\+32.74%](|[\\+14.06%](|[\\+28.92%](| |MSCI All Country World|Global|[\\+22.34%](|[\\+22.44%](|[\\+21.98%](|[\\+18.10%](|[\\+23.60%](|",

      "selftext": "I thought this list was very interesting for 2026 by JPM. Only one of the MAG7 made the list, but AVGO is in the trillion dollar club. I own only 12 of these names with recent additions of SBUX and CRM, expecting big turnarounds next year. Price targets for some of them are a little odd, projecting only very small growth in 2026. For example XOM is already at $120 and the JPM's target is only $124. Really, does this made it a top stock pick? Regardless, this is a pretty diverse list with a bunch of energy and healthcare stocks (which is nice to see). Anyway, would like to hear your thoughts on what you agree or disagree with. The start of a new year is always exciting and a good time for fresh ideas. The top picks, all rated Overweight, with price targets: 1.

I own only 12 of these names with recent additions of SBUX and CRM expecting big turnarounds next year . Price targets for some of them are a little odd projecting only very small growth in 2026 . For example XOM is already at $ 120 and the JPMs target is only $ 124 . Really does this made it a top stock pick Regardless this is a pretty diverse list with a bunch of energy and healthcare stocks which is nice to see . Anyway would like to hear your thoughts on what you agree or disagree with . The start of a new year is always exciting and a good time for fresh ideas .

      "selftext": "I’m looking to understand how people would think about allocating capital given the following hypothetical scenario, and I’m interested in the reasoning and frameworks behind different approaches rather than personal financial advice. Scenario: Assume the ability to invest $100,000 annually consistently over the next 10-15 years, with the goal of long-term wealth building while also allowing for some medium-term opportunities. I’ve been reading about a mix of: • long-term compounding assets (equities, funds, etc.) • real estate (residential, multi-unit, or commercial) as a long-game strategy • higher-risk asymmetric assets (e.g., Bitcoin or similar alternatives) as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10+ year horizon, while still allowing for some shorter- to medium-term opportunities. Relevant parameters for context: • Age: early 30s • Location: Southern California, USA (open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida) • Employment: self-employed • Monthly income: \\~$17,000–$20,000 • Debt: none • Liquidity: high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance: moderate-to-high (comfortable with volatility in exchange for long-term upside) • Time horizon: primarily 10+ years, with openness to some shorter-term plays alongside long-term compounding",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m looking to understand how people would think about allocating capital given the following hypothetical scenario and I ’ m interested in the reasoning and frameworks behind different approaches rather than personal financial advice . Scenario Assume the ability to invest $ 100000 annually consistently over the next 1015 years with the goal of longterm wealth building while also allowing for some mediumterm opportunities . I ’ ve been reading about a mix of • longterm compounding assets equities funds etc . • real estate residential multiunit or commercial as a longgame strategy • higherrisk asymmetric assets e.g . Bitcoin or similar alternatives as a smaller portion of a portfolio The main question is how people would think about splitting capital across these buckets if the objective is wealth creation over a 10 year horizon while still allowing for some shorter to mediumterm opportunities . Relevant parameters for context • Age early 30s • Location Southern California USA open to relocating to larger markets such as Las Vegas or Florida • Employment selfemployed • Monthly income $ 17000– $ 20000 • Debt none • Liquidity high percentage of cash income • Risk tolerance moderatetohigh comfortable with volatility in exchange for longterm upside • Time horizon primarily 10 years with openness to some shorterterm plays alongside longterm compounding"

About 3 months ago I discovered tesla puts and weed stocks were a bad choice . I then moved on to tesla calls and oh boy . My last vibe was silver puts for the last day of the year . I got tired of seeing fud saying that silver puts were a bad idea and its best to wait to see how it plays out . Now I officially end the year at 20k on the account for 5 years . Some idiot is going to say but the sp preformed bleh blah blah and you technologically lost money . Good thing he aint smart like us . Theres hope regards"

      "selftext": "Wrapping up the year with a pretty familiar setup for me. I’m still overweight big cap tech / AI adjacent names, mainly because the fundamentals and cash flow are hard to ignore but I’ve definitely been trimming into strength and sitting on more cash than earlier this year. This week’s price action didn’t really change my mind either. Thin volume, quiet selloff, some metals suddenly ripping, and TSLA guiding a bit lower feels more like rotation + year end positioning than fear. My approach going into 2026 is pretty simple: Core positions in large, profitable tech I’m comfortable holding through volatility Some shorter term trades when setups are clean More cash than usual, waiting for better risk/reward instead of chasing After trading through a few cycles, I’ve learned I don’t need to be “all in” at year end. I’d rather stay flexible and let the market show its hand in Q1. Curious how others here are positioned right now: Still fully invested? I’m intentionally avoiding smaller speculative names right now. I’ve been burned enough times chasing narratives when liquidity dries up.",

This week ’ s price action didn ’ t really change my mind either . Thin volume quiet selloff some metals suddenly ripping and TSLA guiding a bit lower feels more like rotation year end positioning than fear . My approach going into 2026 is pretty simple Core positions in large profitable tech I ’ m comfortable holding through volatility Some shorter term trades when setups are clean More cash than usual waiting for better riskreward instead of chasing After trading through a few cycles I ’ ve learned I don ’ t need to be “ all in ” at year end . I ’ d rather stay flexible and let the market show its hand in Q1 . Curious how others here are positioned right now Still fully invested I ’ m intentionally avoiding smaller speculative names right now . I ’ ve been burned enough times chasing narratives when liquidity dries up ."

      "selftext": "JPMorgan expects the labor market to slow in early 2026, followed by gradual improvement in the latter half of the year. The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies, which have reduced labor supply. Monthly job growth may decline from 50,000 to 15,000 as businesses remain cautious. Despite the slowdown in job growth, the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually. I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year, particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology. As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor, automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform. While near-term gains may prove elusive, a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate. What are your thoughts on this?",

The 2025 slowdown is linked to trade uncertainties and tightened immigration policies which have reduced labor supply . Monthly job growth may decline from 50000 to 15000 as businesses remain cautious . Despite the slowdown in job growth the unemployment rate is projected to rise gradually . I believe this news signals stock market volatility next year particularly in sectors reliant on hiring and consumer confidence like consumer goods and technology . As companies seek to reduce reliance on labor automation and artificial intelligence stocks may outperform . While nearterm gains may prove elusive a recovery could emerge in the latter half of the year should job growth accelerate . What are your thoughts on this"

      "selftext": "I've begun seriously considering whether to reduce or exit my Tesla position. Background: I've held Tesla (TSLA) for over three years. Long-term, I still believe the stock could reach $500 next year, but its recent performance... has been disappointing. Even as the broader market resumed its rally, TSLA failed to follow suit. Therefore, I'm contemplating: Limited upside potential over the next six months Volatility has significantly decreased compared to previous years TSLA currently constitutes an excessive portion of my portfolio, raising concerns from a risk perspective Consequently, I'm considering whether to redirect some capital toward more stable defensive plays like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), or select other low-volatility, dividend-paying stocks to smooth investment fluctuations. This isn't a bearish stance on Tesla itself, but rather a consideration of opportunity cost and concentration risk. Seeking others' perspectives: Would you hold TSLA through this volatility? Reduce exposure while maintaining core holdings? Switch to dividend/defensive stocks? Looking forward to diverse viewpoints, especially from fellow long-term TSLA investors.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive begun seriously considering whether to reduce or exit my Tesla position . Background Ive held Tesla TSLA for over three years . Longterm I still believe the stock could reach $ 500 next year but its recent performance ... has been disappointing . Even as the broader market resumed its rally TSLA failed to follow suit . Therefore Im contemplating Limited upside potential over the next six months Volatility has significantly decreased compared to previous years TSLA currently constitutes an excessive portion of my portfolio raising concerns from a risk perspective Consequently Im considering whether to redirect some capital toward more stable defensive plays like Johnson Johnson JNJ or select other lowvolatility dividendpaying stocks to smooth investment fluctuations . This isnt a bearish stance on Tesla itself but rather a consideration of opportunity cost and concentration risk . Seeking others perspectives Would you hold TSLA through this volatility Reduce exposure while maintaining core holdings Switch to dividenddefensive stocks Looking forward to diverse viewpoints especially from fellow longterm TSLA investors ."

      "selftext": "While the stock market continues to hit all-time highs, the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating. We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a K-shaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living. For the average person, the economy has been in a recession for a year, while the top quintile rides an AI-fueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest over-investment bubble in history. Big Tech is currently pouring over $200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips, yet we are still waiting for a mass-market business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex. And even if there will be a business model, it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising....Just as a side note. The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance. With US national debt crossing $37 trillion, the interest payments alone have breached the $1 trillion mark, now exceeding the entire defense budget. The Fed is trapped in a \"no-win\" scenario: they cannot hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury, but they cannot cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by de-globalization and China’s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse. Simultaneously, the global liquidity taps are being turned off. The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money, and as rates hit the 1% mark, the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets. This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a \"wild\" 2026 bond auction season, taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring. Another hidden fuse (or rather gasoline), however, is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs. We have a massive \"shadow banking\" sector in private credit that hasn't been stress-tested in a high-rate environment. On the other side, when the AI bubble pops, the ETF correlation trap snaps shut. Because passive investing now dominates the market, a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously, driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0. This won't stay confined to the stock market; it will bleed into the housing market. I haven't even touched on the cost of living, US/France/Germany Bond auctions etc. Now my question: Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion? As the Fed is no position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm?",

      "selftext_processed": "While the stock market continues to hit alltime highs the underlying structural integrity of the global economy is disintegrating . We are currently witnessing a massive divergence where asset prices are decoupled from the reality of a Kshaped economy and skyrocketing cost of living . For the average person the economy has been in a recession for a year while the top quintile rides an AIfueled wave that is increasingly looking like the largest overinvestment bubble in history . Big Tech is currently pouring over $ 200 billion annually into AI infrastructure and Nvidia chips yet we are still waiting for a massmarket business model that generates actual revenue to justify this Capex . And even if there will be a business model it will have a deflationary effect as every company will want to have the efficiency gains that AI is promising .... Just as a side note . The situation is exacerbated by a Federal Reserve that is completely cornered by fiscal dominance . With US national debt crossing $ 37 trillion the interest payments alone have breached the $ 1 trillion mark now exceeding the entire defense budget . The Fed is trapped in a nowin scenario they can not hike rates further without bankrupting the Treasury but they can not cut deep enough to save the economy without reigniting an inflation that is already being pushed up by deglobalization and China ’ s deflationary collapse fueled by their real estate collapse . Simultaneously the global liquidity taps are being turned off . The Bank of Japan is ending decades of easy money and as rates hit the 1 % mark the trillions of dollars locked in the Yen Carry Trade are being sucked out of Western markets . This global margin call is happening just as Germany prepares for a wild 2026 bond auction season taking on massive new debt that could send European yields soaring . Another hidden fuse or rather gasoline however is the explosion of Private Credit and the systemic risk of Retail ETFs . We have a massive shadow banking sector in private credit that hasnt been stresstested in a highrate environment . On the other side when the AI bubble pops the ETF correlation trap snaps shut . Because passive investing now dominates the market a mass exit means ETFs must sell every underlying asset simultaneously driving the correlation of all stocks toward 1.0 . This wont stay confined to the stock market it will bleed into the housing market . I havent even touched on the cost of living USFranceGermany Bond auctions etc . Now my question Are we watching the stars the aligning rn for a total implosion As the Fed is no_position to bail anybody out like 2008 without causing even more harm"

      "selftext": "Just yesterday (December 30th), Trump Media & Technology Group ($DJT) officially launched five new ETFs through its fintech brand \"Truth.Fi\". Although $DJT's stock price fell by 4.5% after the announcement (a typical \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" scenario), the underlying holdings of these funds reveal the current administration's economic strategy for 2026. The \"America First\" Five: TSSD (Security and Defense): Heavily invested in Palantir ($PLTR) and Palo Alto Networks ($PANW). This isn't just about tanks and cannons, but rather AI-driven warfare logic. TSFN (Next Frontier): Focused on \"breakthrough\" technologies, appearing to be a high-beta play on domestic innovation. TSIC (American Idols): Investing in blue-chip brands that represent the \"American spirit.\" TSES (Energy Security): This is an interesting mix, including both ExxonMobil ($XOM) and utility stocks like Constellation Energy ($CEG), betting on a \"fracking frenzy\" policy to meet the power demands of AI. TSRS (Red State Real Estate Trust): Specifically targeting real estate in conservative-leaning states. This is a pure play on the trend of population migration inland. Why is this worth paying attention to now? Although the 0.65% management fee is slightly high, the timing is very precise. With the 25% auto tariff and reciprocal trade act set to take full effect in early 2026, these funds aim to capture the benefits of \"manufacturing reshoring.\" Furthermore, with the SEC's changing stance, there are strong calls for the group to launch a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency ETF in early 2026. The core question: Are these funds merely \"political stunts,\" or can they truly generate excess returns by tracking specific sectors supported by the government?",

      "title": "Why did most semiconductor stocks weaken at year end while NVDA bucked the trend and rose?",
      "selftext": "Semiconductor stocks were mostly lower to end the 2025 trading year, as investors looked to lock in profits heading into 2026. However, NVDA bucked the trend, posting a modest gain after reports emerged that the company had approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM to increase production of its H200 GPUs, amid a surge in Chinese demand. TSM shares rose 2% on the news. Other semiconductor stocks also declined at the close, including Micron (MU), whose market value has surged this year. Micron's stock fell 1.6% on Wednesday but has risen over 220% due to robust AI demand. Storage companies Seagate Technology (STX), SanDisk (SNDK), and Western Digital (WDC) also saw similar declines on Wednesday. However, like Micron, these three companies have also seen their 2025 valuations surge significantly due to AI investments. Storage and traditional semiconductor companies have significantly outperformed the broader market this year. Do you believe this trend can continue through 2026? Will you continue holding these leading semiconductor stocks, or consider reallocating during short term volatility?",

However NVDA bucked the trend posting a modest gain after reports emerged that the company had approached Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company TSM to increase production of its H200 GPUs amid a surge in Chinese demand . TSM shares rose 2 % on the news . Other semiconductor stocks also declined at the close including Micron MU whose market value has surged this year . Microns stock fell 1.6 % on Wednesday but has risen over 220 % due to robust AI demand .

      "selftext": "Being a 30-something year old with a 30+ year window until retirement, I generally subscribe to the \"VOO and chill\" method for the bulk of my non-qualified long-term investing. I also have a target-dated 401K and some speculative stocks. My income is over the Roth limit so that is not an option. While my target-date fund will continuously rebalance as I approach retirement, what is the best strategy to reduce risk in my (eventually) heavy-weighted VOO portfolio in 20+ years when I am closer to retirement? From what I understand I would either have to realize gains to move funds to a more conservative option (while potentially still being in a high income tax bracket), or simply stop contributing to VOO and invest in more conservative funds to slowly rebalance. Am I missing another strategy?",

Will be nimble (e.g. take profits, reallocate to better performing opportunities, cut losses, etc.) First pick - PAA - inspired by the drill baby drill post from a couple years ago! - PAA continues to execute: year over year EBITDA growth, deleveraging, making add-on acquisitions, and divesting non-core businesses - Low IV: makes sense given it’s a dividend stock, but IV is historically low. Can pick up Jan 2027 $20C for $0.40. A 5% rise in underlying stock price should make these double. a 10% rise would triple and a 14% rise would make these quadruple. - Attractive valuation: trading at sub 7x EV / EBITDA which is less than peers (ET trades for 8.5x) Will keep you updated on all future trades.

First pick PAA inspired by the drill baby drill post from a couple years ago PAA continues to execute year over year EBITDA growth deleveraging making addon acquisitions and divesting noncore businesses Low IV makes sense given it ’ s a dividend stock but IV is historically low . Can pick up Jan 2027 $ 20C for $ 0.40 . A 5 % rise in underlying stock price should make these double . a 10 % rise would triple and a 14 % rise would make these quadruple . Attractive valuation trading at sub 7x EV EBITDA which is less than peers ET trades for 8.5x Will keep you updated on all future trades . Goal for 2026 is $ 500k ."

      "selftext": "China’s demand for Nvidia’s H200 chips reflects both technological dependence and strategic urgency. Nvidia’s GPUs are currently the gold standard for training and deploying large AI models. Their performance, software ecosystem (like CUDA and cuDNN), and integration with global AI frameworks make them hard to replace. China’s domestic alternatives lag behind. While China has made significant investments in chip design (e.g., Huawei’s Ascend, Alibaba’s Hanguang), these chips generally trail Nvidia in raw performance, software support, and developer adoption. U.S. export controls have also cut off access to advanced chip manufacturing tools, making it harder for Chinese firms to catch up quickly. Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent, and ByteDance are racing to develop competitive AI models. Without access to top-tier compute, they risk falling behind US rivals. Chinese firms are scrambling to secure as many Nvidia chips as possible based on uncertainty that U.S. restrictions may tighten again. This behavior signals a lack of domestic substitutes and a fear of future supply shocks.",

      "selftext": "I structured my portfolio with ETFs (VOO, VGT, QQQ) as the core and stocks as a smaller allocation (15–20%). Due to outsized gains in stocks like PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB, the stocks portion has now grown to 50% of the portfolio (stocks total is about $100k). Should I rebalance my portfolio? I sold about 30% of PLTR and RKLB late last year when they grew 6-7x, but since then they have grown another 2-3x (not sure if I should regret though lol). I’m currently considering the following options, but I’m open to other ideas: 1. Rebalance the current % in the table below to the new target % (mostly trimming PLTR, NVDA and RKLB to buy other stocks) 2. Trim PLTR, NVDA, and RKLB but move the money to ETFs 3. Do nothing and continue monthly contributions as usual What's your take? |Stock|Current %|New Target %|Comment| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |PLTR|26.4|19|High growth| |NVDA|22.5|20|High growth| |RKLB|14.2|10|High growth| |GOOGL|14.4|20| | |AMZN|7.5|9| | |AMD|4.5|5| | |TSLA|3.8| |Not a fan anymore| |LUNR|1.8|3|Added 2 months back| |NBIS|1.7|3|Added 2 months back| |ASTS|1.2|3|Added 2 months back| |S|1|2|Added 2 months back| |IONQ|1|1|Added 2 months back| |IREN| |2|New| |VRT| |3|New|",

Ownership and control should confer: \\-cash flow \\-utility \\-productive use \\-enforceable rights If an asset only has value because someone else might buy it later, then returns depend on a greater fool, not ownership.

      "selftext": "The trend lines are rather obvious. At some point, people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships, and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025, the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half (47%) of U.S. households are married couples, a slide from 66% fifty years ago. The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women, and 25% of 40-year-olds have never been married. Currently, 42% of U.S. adults are single, and for many, it isn't a choice; it’s structural isolation. GWI research shows that 80% of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months. Crucially, 31% of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation. The share of Americans who say they have no close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021. One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated. This has created a massive loneliness economy. The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $280 billion by 2032. Within this, the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode. Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8%, projecting the industry to hit $140.7 billion by 2030. In 2023, you could only text these things. In 2025, you could talk to them. By 2027, Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space. This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn’t a flop, it was just early. Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar. These use machine learning to generate photorealistic, real-time representations of humans, capturing subtle eye movements, skin texture, and mouth twitches. The Lex Fridman/Zuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together. Running these used to require a supercomputer, but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars (GPiCA) has significantly reduced compute requirements. By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair, Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4. Combine this with Meta’s absurd amount compute (they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350,000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600,000 H100s) and you have complete vertical integration &nbsp: - **The Brain:** Llama 4 and beyond. - **The Body:** GPiCA Codec Avatars. - **The Hardware:** Quest - **The Memory Software:** Reality Labs &nbsp: By 2030, people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends, All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out. IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit: A lot of people seem to doubt this. I’d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today. People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models. Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable. The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists. Like it or not, Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this",

      "selftext_processed": "The trend lines are rather obvious . At some point people became unable to form romantic and platonic relationships and the data from late 2025 confirms this As of December 2025 the U.S. Census Bureau confirmed that fewer than half 47 % of U.S. households are married couples a slide from 66 % fifty years ago . The median age for a first marriage is at a record 30.8 for men and 28.4 for women and 25 % of 40yearolds have never_been married . Currently 42 % of U.S. adults are single and for many it isnt a choice it ’ s structural isolation . GWI research shows that 80 % of Gen Z reported feeling lonely in the last 12 months . Crucially 31 % of Gen Z males specifically cite being single as the primary driver of their isolation . The share of Americans who say they have no_close friends has increased 4x from 1990 to 2021 . One quarter of Americans 65 and up are socially isolated . This has created a massive loneliness economy . The global market for mental wellness technology was valued at $ 118 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $ 280 billion by 2032 . Within this the specific niche of AI companions is expected to explode . Recent 2025 sector reports have upgraded the CAGR to 30.8 % projecting the industry to hit $ 140.7 billion by 2030 . In 2023 you could only text these things . In 2025 you could talk to them . By 2027 Mixed Reality and Passthrough Technology will allow you to put them into your physical space . This is where things go parabolic imo Metas Reality Labs wasn ’ t a flop it was just early . Metas linchpin is their Codec Avatar . These use machine learning to generate photorealistic realtime representations of humans capturing subtle eye movements skin texture and mouth twitches . The Lex FridmanZuckerberg interview showed that this technology creates a level of presence that tricks the brain into feeling physically together . Running these used to require a supercomputer but a December 2025 breakthrough called Gaussian Pixel Codec Avatars GPiCA has significantly reduced compute requirements . By combining triangle meshes for skin with 3D Gaussian Splats for volumetric hair Meta can now render photorealistic beings on mobile chips like those in the Quest 4 . Combine this with Meta ’ s absurd amount compute they finished 2024 with an infrastructure of 350000 NVIDIA H100s and a total portfolio equivalent to 600000 H100s and you have complete vertical integration nbsp The Brain Llama 4 and beyond . The Body GPiCA Codec Avatars . The Hardware Quest The Memory Software Reality Labs nbsp By 2030 people will be strapping on headsets to walk through quaint virtual towns with their AI girlfriends All while Zuck racks in subscription fees and utilizes agentic advertising to cash out . IMO Zuck is the most likely candidate to capitalize on the structural loneliness phenomena Edit A lot of people seem to doubt this . I ’ d recommend listening to the NYT Daily podcast that came out today . People are already forming deep bonds with just voice models . Structural loneliness in the US is undeniable . The tech to introduce physical representations of synthetic partners into your real space already exists . Like it or not_Meta is best positioned to capitalise on this"

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching AppLovin Corporation (APP) closely lately and wanted to get some outside perspectives. APP has been one of the strongest performers in the ad-tech / mobile monetization space, driven largely by its AI powered ad optimization (Axon) and improving margins. Revenue growth has been strong, and the market clearly rewarded that over the past year. That said, at these levels, a few things I’m personally weighing: Valuation is no longer cheap, especially after the recent run-up Growth expectations feel very high going into the next earnings Regulatory and data-privacy headlines still seem like an overhang, even if nothing material has changed recently I’m not bearish on the business more just trying to decide whether this is a hold/add on pullbacks story or if expectations have gotten ahead of fundamentals in the short term. Curious how others here are thinking about APP: Long term compounder? Or a great company that’s priced for perfection right now? Not financial advice genuinely interested in discussion.",

      "selftext": "So, I am trading for years in the stock market, usually using Technical Analysis with some fundamental analysis. Lately I have been paying more attention to insider purchases in order to understand and follow the “smart money”. For example Elliott Hill the CEO of $NKE just disclosed an open market purchase of 16,388 shares at Average price of $61.10 it’s about $1.0M of personal capital. What makes it interesting for me was that about a week earlier two directors were purchasing at the same day. Tim Cook and Robert Holmes Swan, both buying in the high $50s. So I was wondering if do you guys: 1.pay attention to insider buying at all? 2.treat CEO buys differently from directors? 3.is this something use it for confirmation, context, or mostly ignore?",

      "selftext_processed": "So I am trading for years in the stock market usually using Technical Analysis with some fundamental analysis . Lately I have been paying more attention to insider purchases in order to understand and follow the “ smart money ” . For example Elliott Hill the CEO of $ NKE just disclosed an open market purchase of 16388 shares at Average price of $ 61.10 it ’ s about $ 1.0M of personal capital . What makes it interesting for me was that about a week earlier two directors were purchasing at the same day . Tim Cook and Robert Holmes Swan both buying in the high $ 50s . So I was wondering if do you guys 1.pay attention to insider buying at all 2.treat CEO buys differently from directors 3.is this something use it for confirmation context or mostly ignore"

      "selftext": "This story starts around the time when tariff was such a scary word it was moving the market like 5-10% every time Trump would say it. I downloaded Robinhood as any young man thinking that these day trading discords would change my life would, and I got to work. Naturally, I got my ass kicked. Like day in day out I was just losing money. I turned 30k into about 28k. Then something miraculous happened, the market began to pump. I thought I was just making genius trades trading SPY4x Leveraged stock though. I was making a small amount every day and I was happy. Then I got burnt out, I thought it wasn’t for me and just put all my money in my bank account. I then went to Navy bootcamp and the stock market was the least I was worried about. Well it turns out the market was printing, I saw this in August and thought “no way this can keep going.” It proceeded to keep going. I’m not even kidding I started investing on the lowest point the market was at for the whole year, I could of invested in literally anything and got my money back with a 30-40% gain. Instead I thought I was the wolf on Wall Street and tried to time the market and left the year almost perfectly even. This showed me that this time around I’m just maxing out my Roth, putting it in VOO and some other low risk index’s, and forgetting about the money entirely. Never again will I try to beat the market.😔😔",

I downloaded Robinhood as any young man thinking that these day trading discords would change my life would and I got to work . Naturally I got my ass kicked . Like day in day out I was just losing money . I turned 30k into about 28k . Then something miraculous happened the market began to pump . I thought I was just making genius trades trading SPY4x Leveraged stock though . I was making a small amount every day and I was happy . Then I got burnt out I thought it wasn ’ t for me and just put all my money in my bank account . I then went to Navy bootcamp and the stock market was the least I was worried about . Well it turns out the market was printing I saw this in August and thought “ no way this can keep going. ” It proceeded to keep going . I ’ m not_even kidding I started investing on the lowest point the market was at for the whole year I could of invested in literally anything and got my money back with a 3040 % gain . Instead I thought I was the wolf on Wall Street and tried to time the market and left the year almost perfectly even . This showed me that this time around I ’ m just maxing out my Roth putting it in VOO and some other low risk index ’ s and forgetting about the money entirely . Never_again will I try to beat the market.😔😔"

So far, I’ve been researching SOXX for semiconductor exposure and SKYY for cloud computing. I like the idea of using ETFs instead of picking individual tech stocks because of diversification and lower risk compared to betting on one company. I’m looking for more ETFs with similar exposure (AI, data centers, chips, cloud, software, etc.). What other ETFs should I research? Are there things I should be careful about, like fees, concentration risk, or too much overlap between funds?",

      "selftext": "I am a 60 year old UK national in Swizterland temporarly until 2030. I will return to the UK then I was forced to sell my london home in 2024 due to divorce and horrific tenants i couldnt deal with from abroad. I had planned to buy a flat straight away in london but because of supply , demand , price and distance couldnt find anything and at the same time I was earning 1% only from Santander. 18 months have passed. After my divorce, I reconciled all my debts and the result was 500k GBP in the bank . I have no stocks , shares or private pension. I am also suffering from deep depression and anxiety issues. whilst fighting for my rights as a father. I am working part time in a low paid job that covers my rent and health insurance only here. I had companies / marriages which cost me dearly . Now its the end of 2025. I did marginally better by santander which is giving 2.47% interest subject to income tax . I still did not manage to buy a flat. I am getting more and more depressed. Information overload from many sources doesnt help. I am scared of risky investing as j am sure I will be refreshing my screen 99 times away. Dividends and Bank Interest attract tax in Switzerland. There is no tax on capital gains so I am looking for lower risk investment trust that provides capital gains only. I want to invest 400k GBP in something that would attract dividends or interest and just grow for the next 3 years whilst I try to recover For a risk averse , fearful , useless investor would this be be OK . your thoughts please",

      "selftext_processed": "I am a 60 year old UK national in Swizterland temporarly until 2030 . I will return to the UK then I was forced to sell my london home in 2024 due to divorce and horrific tenants i couldnt deal with from abroad . I had planned to buy a flat straight away in london but because of supply demand price and distance couldnt find anything and at the same time I was earning 1 % only from Santander . 18 months have passed . After my divorce I reconciled all my debts and the result was 500k GBP in the bank . I have no_stocks shares or private pension . I am also suffering from deep depression and anxiety issues . whilst fighting for my rights as a father . I am working part time in a low paid job that covers my rent and health insurance only here . I had companies marriages which cost me dearly . Now its the end of 2025 . I did marginally better by santander which is giving 2.47 % interest subject to income tax . I still did not_manage to buy a flat . I am getting more and more depressed . Information overload from many sources doesnt help . I am scared of risky investing as j am sure I will be refreshing my screen 99 times away . Dividends and Bank Interest attract tax in Switzerland . There is no_tax on capital gains so I am looking for lower risk investment trust that provides capital gains only . I want to invest 400k GBP in something that would attract dividends or interest and just grow for the next 3 years whilst I try to recover For a risk averse fearful useless investor would this be be OK . your thoughts please"

A stock goes up by 10% and then the next year that same stock goes up by 8% that gain from the first year is also going up by 8%. But say in a S&S ISA. I invest a certain amount every month and am not looking to sell. Surely because I hadn’t sold, the unrealised profit doesn’t get that compounding because I haven’t reinvested it?? Hopefully that makes sense, but can someone explain that to me because I’m struggling to understand it. Thank you!",

I’ve been pretty optimistic about AI, but I was looking at the data recently and it’s freaking me out. Retail investors are buying in at record highs, but corporate insiders are selling at a 27:1 ratio right now. Why is 'smart money' cashing out so aggressively? Then you look at SoftBank, they are literally selling their winning stocks (Nvidia, T-Mobile) just to scrape together cash to pay OpenAI by the end of the year. It honestly feels like the whole industry is just trying to keep the valuation inflated long enough to IPO OpenAI next year so the VCs can exit. I don’t want to be a fearmonger but does this look like a massive wealth transfer setup to anyone else? Or am I just overthinking it? I know this isn't too different from the whole 'AI bubble' panic but I feel like the timeline seems more concrete now with Google's soon-to-be lead in AI.",

      "selftext": "33m planning to retire at 60. I'm currently making \\~125k/year. With inflation/lifestyle I'm expecting to need \\~200K/year in retirement. * Roth IRA $13,000 in SCHD. I'm contributing the 7K/yr from this point forward. Estimating 5% share price growth rate and 8.5% dividend growth rate. * At 60 this would be worth \\~1.6M with dividends bringing in about \\~125K/yr * at 65 this would be worth \\~2.8M with dividends bringing in about \\~316K/yr * At 70 this would be worth \\~6.2M with dividends bringing in about \\~830K/yr * 401K $160,000 in FXAIX. I'm only contributing up to the employer match. Estimated 8% returns * At 60 this would be worth \\~2-2.5M * \\~240K/yr gets me through about 9 years (including a continued return) * HSA $5,500 in FXAIX. I'm contributing 7,800/yr from this point forward. Estimated 8% returns * At 65 this would be worth \\~1.2M I should have enough money in my 401K to easily get me through \\~7 years. At 67 I should be making somewhere in the ballpark of 450K/year of tax free dividends. I will also still have my HSA growing in the background, unless it's needed for health. I guess what I'm asking is: 1. Is my math mathing? 2. Wouldn't this leave me/my family in an unbelievable position when I inevitably kick the bucket? Just shift to the dividend life at \\~67 and reinvest whatever I don't use. 3. What am I missing? It's late... I have to be missing something.",

I understand RKLB is priced as a high-growth stock as it should be, but it seems as though FOMO and hype surrounding the space industry has risen to an unsustainable level. At 68X sales it looks like RKLB is almost priced for perfection. That being said, RKLB is an amazing company with an incredible opportunity to take significant market share as the 2nd space company in the US behind SpaceX. I know many of you likely got in early and will be holding long term. What I would love to hear is your thoughts on its current valuation relative to where the company is today. No one can predict the future, but do you think $70/share is a fair price to pay? If you had never invested in RKLB, would you now at the current price? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "Couer Mining (CDE) closed the day at $18.09 according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext_processed": "Couer Mining CDE closed the day at $ 18.09 according to VectorVest they are valued at 32.5 share . Therefore they are extremely undervalued . Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026 They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD a Canadian mining company . Once this merger goes through they will have 7 operations across North America . They will have the production capability of 900000oz of gold and 20000000oz of silver . They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit . They have had production expansion like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas . Therefore they are still growing . They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year . I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026 . Their debt is mostly longterm and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt . The coupon is fixed . I could not_find the allin sustaining cost but it cost them $ 248m to sell $ 554.6m worth of gold and silver . All their mines are considered to be in safe areas they have 3 in the US 2 in Mexico and 1 explorational site in BC . After the merger they will acquire more sites in Canada . So none of the mines will be politically impacted . They have no_active offering as a matter of fact they have a $ 75 million share buyback program valid through May 31 2026 . Their free cash flow is positive at $ 188M ."

      "selftext": "Hello, stock traders. I thought I'd share an idea with you. On another subreddit I'm on, someone had posted a list of \"low RSI\" stocks he'd screened (less than 30, but >10, to weed out anomalies), with prices above $2. The idea being that these might be oversold and/or due to go up for whatever reasons. I've never felt like I could predict *if* a stock should go up, let alone *when*. But I can tell when one **is** going up. We all can. So my mind immediately went to the *other* extreme of RSI, and I filtered above 70 (and <90). Share price above $50, and Volume >50k were the only other filters I used. I got 46 hits on Barchart, and in hindsight I could've lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates. And maybe price, but I personally wouldn't go <$20. I sorted by 3-month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up. Then I started flipping through charts using Barchart's \"flipcharts\" feature. Candidates I liked, *strictly based on their charts* (no other research) were: ALB, AA, AUGO, PAAS, GM, RIO, FDX, TD, & BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose (because I 'diversify' with just 3 tickers at a time), I charted those 9 against each other by 3's. That yielded these 3 charts: [9 stocks 3 ways, 6-month views]( Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts. (I use 6-month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is.) **Which stock from each chart would** ***you*** **choose?** I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view (and that influenced 2 picks), but I chose: >!AA, RIO, TD!< (Click to see. This is the 'spoiler' feature of Reddit.) As a final sanity check, I plotted them against each other, with SPY as the benchmark: [3 momentum picks vs SPY]( And tbh, I don't like how AA looks in this view, but that's down to it having been in the first tranche of 3, which were highest on the 3-month performance sort. But with the averaging effect of the other 2, I can live with it. I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwim's Paper Money to buy them at Monday's open. They filled at: AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days, but it's early yet. I could update this in a month or two if people are interested. Does anyone else do something like this?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello stock traders . I thought Id share an idea with you . On another subreddit Im on someone had posted a list of low RSI stocks hed screened less than 30 but 10 to weed out anomalies with prices above $ 2 . The idea being that these might be oversold andor due to go up for whatever reasons . Ive never_felt like I could predict if a stock should go up let alone when . But I can tell when one is going up . We all can . So my mind immediately went to the other extreme of RSI and I filtered above 70 and 90 . Share price above $ 50 and Volume 50k were the only other filters I used . I got 46 hits on Barchart and in hindsight I couldve lowered the Volume filter to get more candidates . And maybe price but I personally wouldnt go $ 20 . I sorted by 3month performance so I could see which ones are currently going up . Then I started flipping through charts using Barcharts flipcharts feature . Candidates I liked strictly based on their charts no other research were ALB AA AUGO PAAS GM RIO FDX TD BNS Then to decide which 3 of those I might choose because I diversify with just 3 tickers at a time I charted those 9 against each other by 3s . That yielded these 3 charts 9 stocks 3 ways 6month views Scroll down when you get to Imgur to see all 3 charts . I use 6month views even though I sort by 3m performance because it gives me a better idea of how a ticker got to where it is . Which stock from each chart would you choose I have an advantage because I could zoom in to the 3m view and that influenced 2 picks but I chose AA RIO TD Click to see . This is the spoiler feature of Reddit . As a final sanity check I plotted them against each other with SPY as the benchmark 3 momentum picks vs SPY And tbh I dont like how AA looks in this view but thats down to it having been in the first tranche of 3 which were highest on the 3month performance sort . But with the averaging effect of the other 2 I can live with it . I put in Market orders Sunday night in ThinkorSwims Paper Money to buy them at Mondays open . They filled at AA 52.50 RIO 80.46 TD 94.81 All 3 are down a bit after 2 days but its early yet . I could update this in a month or two if people are interested . Does anyone else do something like this"

      "selftext": "I’m 25, work fully remote, and want to be smart about building wealth over the next few years. Here’s my situation: • Income: about $200k per year • Investments: about $100k in the stock market (mostly S&P 500) • Debt: none • Cash: enough for a large down payment or possibly to buy a modest place outright (in a more rural area) • Preferred locations: Denver or Chicago, but I can live anywhere I’m deciding between buying a primary residence, buying an investment property, or continuing to rent while investing heavily in the market. I would keep investing monthly either way. My main question is: would the money I use for a down payment likely perform better staying in the stock market, or is getting into real estate at 25 the smarter long term move? Goal is to reach a net worth of around $1M by age 30. Curious what others would do in my position.",

      "selftext": "I’m about 10 years away from retiring. The 3% bonus into my Roth is very appealing. I know it’s only $240 (minus the $60 for gold) per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not bother but anything to get more money into my Roth. Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth. I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that. I have no problems having accounts at different brokerages (in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages. ) Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account (would only move a percentage, not all). One question, I assume the gold relationship is per person? So I couldn’t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3% instead of 1? Also, can I buy CEFs, BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood? Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything (general question). I don’t panic trade (well at least I hope not) so I am not worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years. I like the idea of a 3% back credit card, I really have no patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m about 10 years away from retiring . The 3 % bonus into my Roth is very appealing . I know it ’ s only $ 240 minus the $ 60 for gold per year and if it was into a taxable account I probably would not_bother but anything to get more money into my Roth . Already have accounts set up at the other major brokerages including a Roth . I am aware of the 5 year Robin Hood rule and I am ok with that . I have no_problems having accounts at different brokerages in fact I consider that a plus in case there is ever an issue with one of my other brokerages . Is it worth moving some of my money over from an existing Roth account would only move a percentage not_all . One question I assume the gold relationship is per person So I couldn ’ t use it for both my spouse and myself to each contribute to a Roth and get the bonus 3 % instead of 1 Also can I buy CEFs BDCs and MLPs through Robin Hood Are there any issues with market or limit orders in terms of fill prices or anything general question . I don ’ t panic trade well at least I hope not_so I am not_worried about accounts being locked up when I trying to get into a crypto position or something but would want to eventually move the money back to a more conventional brokerage in 5 years . I like the idea of a 3 % back credit card I really have no_patience for the sector credit cards where they give you gas stations now and supermarkets the next quarter Any other benefits or downsides"

      "selftext": "For someone who has always focused on diversification, I've gotten in deep with my latest venture. Before 2023, I fancied myself as quite the diversified investor, with most of my portfolio spread across ETFs, Tech stocks, Real-Estate, and Crypto. On paper, it looked responsible. I slept well. Then in 2023, I made a big life change, relocated, and decided to go all-in on building a company. My third. Fast forward to today, and my personal balance sheet looks completely different. What used to be a \\~$300k diversified portfolio is now mostly concentrated in one asset: my ownership equity in an operating fintech company. On paper, that stake is worth more than my old portfolio ever was (>$3m). In reality, my liquid position is now under 3% compared to 40% before my move. This bothers me. From one angle, this looks like rational concentration - founders are supposed to be concentrated in their highest-conviction asset right?. From another angle, it feels like I’ve traded financial resilience for theoretical upside. I’m “wealthier” on paper, but functionally much poorer in cash. So I’m curious how others here think about this from a pure investing perspective: • At what point does concentration in your own business stop being conviction and start being bad portfolio management? • How do you think about liquidity risk vs expected value when the asset is illiquid? • For those who’ve been through this, what did you wish you’d done earlier to rebalance or protect downside? Not looking for validation, genuinely interested in how others frame this trade-off. Am I overthinking it?",

      "selftext": "Yesterday, I made a post in the community discussing the recent AI tech boom and also shared my thoughts on Intel (INTC) as a stock. A lot of people responded that they’re not optimistic about INTC and think it can’t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA (NVDA). Admittedly, in some respects, Intel isn’t on the same level as those two companies right now. However, I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value, and today’s rally kind of proved my point. I’ve always felt that a stock’s price movement isn’t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research. So I’m really curious when you’re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in, what aspects do you usually pay attention to? What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock? I’d love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",

A lot of people responded that they ’ re not_optimistic about INTC and think it can ’ t really compare to TSM or NVIDIA NVDA . Admittedly in some respects Intel isn ’ t on the same level as those two companies right now . However I personally believe that INTC still has some short term investment value and today ’ s rally kind of proved my point . I ’ ve always felt that a stock ’ s price movement isn ’ t determined solely by macro news things like capital flows and market trends are also important factors to consider in our research . So I ’ m really curious when you ’ re deciding whether a stock is worth investing in what aspects do you usually pay attention to What are your standards and methods for evaluating a stock I ’ d love to hear everyone ’ s thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, Wishing you all a lot of professional, personal and financial success, and a happy 2026. Influenced by some Reddit users here, I recently started using GetQuin (free version). However, I must admit I find the platform quite complex. I first tried to manually recreate my three stock portfolios, which were built over the course of this year starting from an initial deposit. After that, I imported my transactions from XTB, which actually worked fine. That said, I noticed that the results were not offset against the initial portfolio balance and instead seemed to duplicate the values, which left me a bit confused. Overall, I got the feeling that the platform largely exceeds my actual needs. What I’m looking for is something simpler, excluding Google Finance / Yahoo Finance (and similar tools), that allows me to: Track the performance of each of my portfolios (stocks, fixed-term deposits, and investment funds) And, in particular: Access detailed information on each individual stock Analyse my portfolio by sector and currency Track dividends, namely: payment dates ex-dividend dates expected/forecast dividends For dividend tracking specifically, I was considering starting to use Track Your Dividends, but ideally I’d like to have everything consolidated in a single platform. Do you have any recommendations for platforms that offer both a mobile app and a browser version, preferably free? Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext": "In 1964, Buffett acquired Berkshire Hathaway at $7.50 per share, which means that at roughly $756,000 per share (Class A common), it has grown its market price at roughly 20% compounded annually, approximately double the CAGR of the S&P index over the same period. EDIT: Perhaps more impressive is that, using data tracked through 2018, Berkshire's per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7% annualized. No other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years. Buffett changed my life in two ways: First, his 1984 article in Hermes, the Columbia Business School paper, \"[The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville](\" introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd, and completely changed my capital allocation/investment management strategy. Second, [this talk]( given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates, specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity. I am confident in Greg Abel's abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders' ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Graham's four key criteria, which I can recite from memory to this day: *An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis, promises safety of principal and an adequate return. Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.*",

EDIT Perhaps more impressive is that using data tracked through 2018 Berkshires per share tangible book value compounded similarly at 18.7 % annualized . No_other company has so consistently tracked so closely between its per share tangible book and market price for 61 years . Buffett changed my life in two ways First his 1984 article in Hermes the Columbia Business School paper The Superinvestors of GrahamandDoddsville introduced me to the writings of Ben Graham and David Dodd and completely changed my capital allocationinvestment management strategy . Second this talk given to a group of Florida University MBA candidates specifically the introduction in which he discusses the importance of integrity . I am confident in Greg Abels abilities and in my fellow Berkshire shareholders ability to continue holding Berkshire management to Ben Grahams four key criteria which I can recite from memory to this day An investment operation is one which upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return . Operations not_meeting these requirements are speculative ."

      "selftext": "Disclaimer: This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate. Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes. TL;DR: CPNG only trades in the U.S., but the crisis is entirely in Korea: lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension, the public is actively boycotting, and this is a newly profitable, logistics-heavy business that cannot survive disruption. U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue; Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis, not a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today. At the National Assembly hearing, lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it’s framed in U.S. outlets. Domestically, investigators are disputing Coupang’s disclosures, challenging sworn testimony, and raising perjury accusations. Internationally, it’s still framed as a data breach plus compensation. Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative, and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem. That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S. The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE. There is no Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage, no local shareholder pressure, and no market release valve. All price discovery happens in the U.S., while all political, regulatory, and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea. Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it. On the ground, public reaction is not abstract. Lawmakers, civic groups, and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension, not just fines or apologies. Korean media coverage has shifted from “breach response” to “whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form.” At the consumer level, large-scale boycott behavior (“탈팡”) is observable, with app-usage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share. In Korea, boycotts are not symbolic — people actually leave platforms, especially when alternatives exist. This is existential for Coupang because of its structure. The company only recently became profitable, after years of losses. It is a logistics-heavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume, dense routing, and habit-driven repeat usage. A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability. Drivers leave. Sellers leave. Customers retrain behavior. This is not a business you can pause and restart. Two weeks ago, Coupang installed a U.S.-trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis. Domestically, that has been widely interpreted as insulating decision-makers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability. That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it. This is why this trade is no longer about valuation, multiples, or growth trajectories. It’s about whether a newly profitable, logistics-dependent company — openly boycotted, politically isolated, under criminal scrutiny, and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure. Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways. U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle. Korea is treating this as a company-ending legitimacy failure. That disconnect is the thesis.

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This was prepared with the help of a Korean associate . Later we fed it in to AI for translation and formatting purposes . TLDR CPNG only trades in the U.S. but the crisis is entirely in Korea lawmakers are talking perjury and suspension the public is actively boycotting and this is a newly profitable logisticsheavy business that can not survive disruption . U.S. investors are pricing a PR issue Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . Coupang is fuk This needs to be viewed as a Korean political and legitimacy crisis not_a U.S. tech stock hiccup — and Korean senators explicitly said that today . At the National Assembly hearing lawmakers directly addressed the gap between how this crisis is reported in Korea versus how it ’ s framed in U.S. outlets . Domestically investigators are disputing Coupang ’ s disclosures challenging sworn testimony and raising perjury accusations . Internationally it ’ s still framed as a data breach plus compensation . Senators openly questioned why foreign investors are seeing a materially softer narrative and several explicitly warned that this information gap itself is becoming part of the problem . That matters even more because Coupang only trades in the U.S . The Korean platform is owned by a Delaware holding company listed on the NYSE . There is no_Korean stock price to reflect domestic outrage no_local shareholder pressure and no_market release valve . All price discovery happens in the U.S. while all political regulatory and consumer pressure is happening inside Korea . Lawmakers are clearly aware of this and unhappy about it . On the ground public reaction is not_abstract . Lawmakers civic groups and labor organizations are openly calling for operational suspension not_just fines or apologies . Korean media coverage has shifted from “ breach response ” to “ whether the company should be allowed to continue operating in its current form. ” At the consumer level largescale boycott behavior “ 탈팡 ” is observable with appusage trackers and business press reporting declines in daily active users while competitors gained share . In Korea boycotts are not_symbolic — people actually leave platforms especially when alternatives exist . This is existential for Coupang because of its structure . The company only recently became profitable after years of losses . It is a logisticsheavy business with thin margins that depends on uninterrupted volume dense routing and habitdriven repeat usage . A sustained boycott or even a temporary suspension would immediately reverse profitability . Drivers leave . Sellers leave . Customers retrain behavior . This is not_a business you can pause and restart . Two weeks ago Coupang installed a U.S.trained American lawyer as CEO to front the crisis . Domestically that has been widely interpreted as insulating decisionmakers behind U.S. legal optics rather than accepting Korean accountability . That perception has worsened public anger and reinforced the political narrative that the company is evading responsibility rather than confronting it . This is why this trade is no_longer about valuation multiples or growth trajectories . It ’ s about whether a newly profitable logisticsdependent company — openly boycotted politically isolated under criminal scrutiny and facing calls for suspension — can survive in a country that actually follows through on public and state pressure . Even if it was about fundamentals they are shit anyways . U.S. markets are pricing a bad news cycle . Korea is treating this as a companyending legitimacy failure . That disconnect is the thesis .

      "selftext": "Apple’s CEO Tim Cook and Nike’s board have shown strong confidence in the company with a combined $2.9 million worth of shares purchased recently. It's clear they believe in the long-term potential, and their actions speak louder than words. Nike’s brand still holds its ground globally, maintaining a leading position in the market. The North American market is showing signs of recovery, and despite a 26% drop in share price, Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world. The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors. With a more attractive valuation, Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity, especially for those who believe in the company’s future growth prospects. The question remains: is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity? Only time will tell, but with insider confidence and global brand strength, it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist.",

Its clear they believe in the longterm potential and their actions speak louder than words . Nike ’ s brand still holds its ground globally maintaining a leading position in the market . The North American market is showing signs of recovery and despite a 26 % drop in share price Nike remains one of the most iconic brands in the world . The current price drop has undoubtedly caught the attention of value investors . With a more attractive valuation Nike is starting to look like a compelling opportunity especially for those who believe in the company ’ s future growth prospects . The question remains is this a temporary dip or the start of a larger opportunity Only time will tell but with insider confidence and global brand strength it might be a good time to consider adding Nike to your watchlist ."

I’m mainly curious how people here are thinking about AMD going into 2026. On the bullish side, AMD seems to be gaining more traction in data center and AI, and they are still taking market share from Intel. Lisa Su has also built a lot of trust over the years when it comes to execution. On the other hand, the stock has already run up quite a bit and competition in AI, especially from Nvidia, is intense. Valuation is also something I’m not fully sure about at these levels. For those who follow AMD closely, do you think the growth story still has room to play out in 2026? Or do you feel most of the good news is already priced in? Not looking for financial advice, just want to hear different perspectives from long term holders and skeptics. Thanks",

Following the $42.5M open-market purchase disclosed earlier, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. already a ~10% owner has returned with a second, larger add. Latest transaction details: • Buyer: Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Co., Ltd. • Shares purchased: 879,573 • Average price: $70.53 • Capital deployed: ~$62M • Transaction type: Open market Zooming out, this reads as repeat accumulation by the same control-capital holder, stepping back in at higher prices rather than waiting for a pullback. Taken together, Mitsui Sumitomo has now deployed over $100M into $WRB in relatively short order. Same buyer. Larger size. Higher prices.

Ltd. • Shares purchased 879573 • Average price $ 70.53 • Capital deployed $ 62M • Transaction type Open market Zooming out this reads as repeat accumulation by the same controlcapital holder stepping back in at higher prices rather than waiting for a pullback . Taken together Mitsui Sumitomo has now deployed over $ 100M into $ WRB in relatively short order . Same buyer . Larger size . Higher prices .

Took 500 to 90k within a month and ended up losing every penny of it (EDIT: THE LOSS PORN IS NOT ABOUT THE $500, but the 90k I peaked at) and now have pretty much nothing to my name. I still have my tech job, but there’s a pretty high chance I’m gonna get laid off soon even if it hasn’t happened yet. Completely lonely in my personal life with no real friends and a non existent dating life. My entire world is crumbling before me and losing all this money is just the final gut punch. If I could give any advice to anyone out there, just don’t trade options. They will ruin your life. Look, I’m not completely giving up yet even though I’m undoubtedly at a very difficult point, but I hope I’ve been able to prevent someone else from having their life ruined by options. Guess I genuinely might have to work at Wendy’s soon. EDIT: I know that I technically only lost $500, but what hurts is that I nearly touched 100k, actually money that I could’ve withdrawn, before falling back to $0. There is no way to mentally see this as just a $500 loss. Trust me I would not be making lost porn posts if I just went straight from $500 to $0. By this logic every dollar gained since birth is funny money because you technically began at $0. EDIT: Yes, I regret that I didn’t even take some of it off the table before inevitably falling back to $0, but i guess hindsight is 20/20 so I can only focus on the future now instead of dwelling on the past.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been reading Citi’s 2026 semiconductor outlook. They expect Broadcom’s revenue from Google to double in 2026 versus 2025, and potentially nearly double again in 2027. Broadcom also appears to have secured meaningful orders from AWS and Microsoft, with strong revenue growth expected by 2027. Citi forecasts that XPUs will grow faster than GPUs by 2027, driven by a smaller base and the acceleration of custom AI chip programs. Some people with a zero-sum mindset might argue this is negative for NVDA or even AMD. But those closer to the industry know that NVIDIA will continue selling every chip, system, and rack it can produce. AVGO and MRVL have also been performing very well, not only in custom ASICs but also across networking and storage. Curious how everyone is positioning in AVGO right now.",

      "selftext": "Obviously a lot of traction of the outperformance of the [2025 WSB picks]( I wanted to do a slightly more thorough analysis to see if there was any real alpha here. **TLDR:** *evidence of excess returns, but the performance is best explained by a highly aggressive, factor-loaded portfolio in a strong market environment* To evaluate alpha, I used standard asset-pricing models, including CAPM and the Fama-French four-factor model (market, size, value, and momentum). These models help distinguish returns driven by skill from returns driven by exposure to known risk factors such as growth, momentum, or small-cap bias. The portfolio was an equal weighted basket of the 10 picks: * AMD * GOOG * HOOD * META * MSTR * PLTR * RDDT * RKLB * TSLA * WMT *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* (*Note: this analysis is through Nov 28, since Fama-French hasnt published daily returns for December*) **Descriptive Stats:** * **Portfolio Return**: 61.2% * **SPY Return**: 17.9% * **Portfolio Outperformance**: 43.3% * **Portfolio Vol**: 44.5% * **SPY Vol**: 20.2% * **Portfolio Sharpe | Sortino**: 1.85 | 2.82 * **SPY Sharpe | Sortino**: 0.86 | 1.29 ***Interpretation:*** *significant outperformance, with significantly more volatility* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **CAPM Regression** * **Adj. R-Squared**: 0.718 * **Market beta**: 1.88 ***Interpretation:*** *The portfolio had an extremely high beta. I.e. if the market goes up, all else equal you expect the portfolio to go up 1.88x the market. If it goes down, same thing in reverse* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Fama-French Four Factor Regression** * **Mkt-Rf**: 1.59 *(very high market risk)* * **SMB**: 0.64 (small cap weighted) * **HML**: -0.73 *(strong growth bias)* * **MOM**: 0.51 *(significant momentum exposure)* ***Interpretation:*** *Confirms that the portfolio was significantly weighted towards \"levered\" growth names* *\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_* **Conclusions:** nothing novel here, WSB tilts towards higher risk, momentum names. If the same exercise is done in 2026, you should expect outperformance if the market goes up and underperformance if the market goes down. *Sources/Methods: Fama-French Library, yFinance, Python* *Happy to answer any questions or provide code if people are interested in running it themselves*",

      "selftext": "I want to share some analysis I’ve been thinking about. I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts. This is for discussion and research purposes only. # 1. Burry’s Thesis Michael Burry’s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated. Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years ([en.bloomingbit.io]( This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality. Burry estimates this mismatch could total $176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 ([investing.com]( He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dot-com era ([sahmcapital.com]( and is using long-dated puts expiring in 2027 (reddit). The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real. But Burry may underestimate AMD’s strategic position. # 2. How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA’s AI dominance was not planned from day one. CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for general-purpose computing, not AI. Ian Buck, a Stanford CS PhD, experimented with GPUs for non-graphics workloads. His project, Brook, became the foundation for CUDA ([en.wikipedia.org]( The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers. Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs, showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude ([en.wikipedia.org]( Key takeaway: NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company. That “stumble” created their early dominance, but nothing guarantees the next discovery will not favor AMD. # 3. AMD’s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with [192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TB/s bandwidth]( giving it a [36% memory advantage over NVIDIA's H200]( (141GB HBM3e @ 4.8 TB/s). Cost is approximately $10-14k per MI300X versus $40-44k for H200 - roughly one quarter of NVIDIA's price. [Microsoft, Meta, Oracle, and TensorWave deployed 327,000 MI300X units in 2024]( with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services. This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale, not experimental deployments. The main constraint is ROCm software maturity. Historical precedent suggests this is temporary - CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance. If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings, AMD's hardware advantage could scale rapidly. # 4. EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical, generation-over-generation growth in server CPUs: |Phase|CPU Generation|Result| |:-|:-|:-| |1|Naples|Re-entry into data centers| |2|Rome|Competitive performance and cost gains attention| |3|Milan|Default choice for workloads| |4|Genoa/Turin|Dominant market share| This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally. The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs. # 5. The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not bursting. That implies sudden collapse. What I see is a gradual rotation. * NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales * Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace * Refresh cycles could stretch * Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no expectation of panic selling. Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold. Burry’s long-dated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash. # 6. Signals to Watch * MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 * Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale * ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration * NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates. # 7. Bottom Line * NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company. AMD could be next. * Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch, but he underestimates AMD's potential impact. * The AI shift is gradual and structural. * If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did, MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape. This analysis is based on research and historical patterns. History is repeating itself, and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA *just like they did with Intel.*",

      "selftext_processed": "I want to share some analysis I ’ ve been thinking about . I hold AMD stock and am pulling the trigger on NVIDIA puts . This is for discussion and research purposes only . 1 . Burry ’ s Thesis Michael Burry ’ s argument is that AI hardware depreciation is being understated . Companies are putting 5 to 6 year useful lives on GPUs that may actually become obsolete in 2 to 3 years en.bloomingbit.io This could make reported earnings appear stronger than reality . Burry estimates this mismatch could total $ 176 billion across the industry between 2026 and 2028 investing.com He compares NVIDIA to Cisco in the dotcom era sahmcapital.com and is using longdated puts expiring in 2027 reddit . The mismatch between accounting and economic reality is real . But Burry may underestimate AMD ’ s strategic position . 2 . How NVIDIA Stumbled Into AI NVIDIA ’ s AI dominance was not_planned from day one . CUDA started as a way to make GPUs useful for generalpurpose computing not_AI . Ian Buck a Stanford CS PhD experimented with GPUs for nongraphics workloads . His project Brook became the foundation for CUDA en.wikipedia.org The AI breakthrough came from independent researchers . Alex Krizhevsky Ilya Sutskever and Geoffrey Hinton at the University of Toronto trained AlexNet on NVIDIA GPUs showing that deep neural networks could outperform CPU solutions by orders of magnitude en.wikipedia.org Key takeaway NVIDIA adapted to a discovery made outside the company . That “ stumble ” created their early dominance but nothing_guarantees the next discovery will not_favor AMD . 3 . AMD ’ s Hardware Readiness MI300X launched with 192GB HBM3 memory and 5.3 TBs bandwidth giving it a 36 % memory advantage over NVIDIAs H200 141GB HBM3e 4.8 TBs . Cost is approximately $ 1014k per MI300X versus $ 4044k for H200 roughly one quarter of NVIDIAs price . Microsoft Meta Oracle and TensorWave deployed 327000 MI300X units in 2024 with Microsoft using MI300X to power Azure OpenAI services . This demonstrates enterprise adoption at scale not_experimental deployments . The main constraint is ROCm software maturity . Historical precedent suggests this is temporary CUDA itself took years to achieve ecosystem dominance . If ROCm adoption accelerates as enterprises validate cost savings AMDs hardware advantage could scale rapidly . 4 . EPYC Playbook Applied to GPUs AMD has a track record of methodical generationovergeneration growth in server CPUs PhaseCPU GenerationResult 1NaplesReentry into data centers 2RomeCompetitive performance and cost gains attention 3MilanDefault choice for workloads 4GenoaTurinDominant market share This shows AMD can take share slowly and structurally . The same pattern could apply to MI400 against NVIDIA GPUs . 5 . The AI Market as a Gradual Rotation The AI bubble is not_bursting . That implies sudden collapse . What I see is a gradual rotation . NVIDIA could slowly lose margin and market share as AMD scales Enterprises may adopt ROCm at a measured pace Refresh cycles could stretch Capital may rotate from NVIDIA to AMD over time There is no_expectation of panic selling . Prices may adjust gradually as these trends unfold . Burry ’ s longdated puts reflect structural pressure rather than an overnight crash . 6 . Signals to Watch MI400 benchmark comparisons versus B300 Cloud providers adopting AMD GPUs at scale ROCm developer adoption and enterprise integration NVIDIA guidance versus actual procurement decisions Tracking these indicators could highlight when capital rotation accelerates . 7 . Bottom Line NVIDIA benefited from a discovery made outside the company . AMD could be next . Burry is right about depreciation and earnings mismatch but he underestimates AMDs potential impact . The AI shift is gradual and structural . If ROCm adoption scales like CUDA did MI400 could reshape the AI hardware landscape . This analysis is based on research and historical patterns . History is repeating itself and I am bullish on AMD beating NVIDIA just like they did with Intel ."

Bought her this 18k Tiffany heart necklace for her birthday seemed like the right move at the time. She breaks up with me just a couple weeks before the day. I kept it because returning it felt like admitting defeat (and honestly, I forgot about the return window). Then gold just takes off goes straight up like NVDA on a hot streak. The necklace is suddenly worth 50% more. She’s long gone, no texts or anything. Gold doesn’t disappear on you. Somehow accidentally hedged against the heartbreak. Lesson learned: relationships come and go, but commodities? They’re forever!!!",

      "selftext": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams. And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for \"low quality\". So here's the more TLDR version of my thesis: The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects. The entire AI \"Growth\" story ends in 2026 if there's no InP substrates + materials. BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL? One Company: $AXTI. There's two bottlenecks: InP Substrates - \\- Hyperscaler optics (TPU pods, etc) \\- Optical transceivers (5g, data) \\- LiDAR (robotaxis, drones, military) \\-Optical Modules (interconnect clusters) \\- Silicon photonics laser dies (Nvidia’s future co-packaged optics and Intel/Broadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays.) This is a DUOPOLY from \\-AXTI (est. \\~30–35%) \\-Sumitomo (est.\\~30%) \\- JX Nippon (est. 10-15%) Indium Phosphide (the source material for everything): Vital Materials - 35% AXT - 25% Before, this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom. Now they're used for the entire AI buildout. Just to give u an example $AXTI -> $LITE -> $GOOGL TPU. without any of these members, the program shuts down. Google would literally pay $5B (50 TIMES prices + \\~$140m TAM from 2024) DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers -> hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesn't stall because Meta decided to buy them out. And this would only be a like a 3-4% added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap. If Meta does it first, then Google's TPU program stalls. If Google does it first Microsoft's ASIC problem stalls. THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW (demand > supply by multiple factors pre-ramp) AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains. Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck? Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI. This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis + materials research. Nobody's posted about this stock here in the past 5 years, you're welcome. Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday, because there's a low chance this goes from $15 to $150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026. I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof. NFI, there's a chance China sends this to $0 with export controls so don't follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts. But if this goes to $0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout. I just thought this could also easily be a $7B company given they control 1/3rd of the world's entire substrate capacity and then 1/4th of the world's entire materials used for AI buildout. It's a monopoly in mining -> refining -> substrate production. And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide. I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary. TLDR: THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY. FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI, WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP.",

      "selftext_processed": "I drew colossus from Starcraft 2 to represent laser beams . And prepared a whole thesis but kept getting automodded for low quality . So heres the more TLDR version of my thesis The Entire AI Industry is shifting to photonics from Google TPU to optical interconnects . The entire AI Growth story ends in 2026 if theres no_InP substrates materials . BUT GUESS WHO CONTROLS IT ALL One Company $ AXTI . Theres two bottlenecks InP Substrates Hyperscaler optics TPU pods etc Optical transceivers 5g data LiDAR robotaxis drones military Optical Modules interconnect clusters Silicon photonics laser dies Nvidia ’ s future copackaged optics and IntelBroadcom SiPh engines use InP CW laser arrays . This is a DUOPOLY from AXTI est . 30–35 % Sumitomo est.30 % JX Nippon est . 1015 % Indium Phosphide the source material for everything Vital Materials 35 % AXT 25 % Before this was a commodity with low TAM just for telecom . Now theyre used for the entire AI buildout . Just to give u an example $ AXTI $ LITE $ GOOGL TPU . without any of these members the program shuts down . Google would literally pay $ 5B 50 TIMES prices $ 140m TAM from 2024 DIRECTLY to one of these suppliers hand to COHR just so their whole TPU program doesnt stall because Meta decided to buy them out . And this would only be a like a 34 % added cost to their BOM because this thing was so cheap . If Meta does it first then Googles TPU program stalls . If Google does it first Microsofts ASIC problem stalls . THE WORLD IS AT MAX CAPACITY RIGHT NOW demand supply by multiple factors preramp AND THIS IS GAME THEORY on materials supply chains . Guess who shows up twice in the WHOLE AI bottleneck Both as the duopoly bottleneck and the duopoly bottleneck of the bottleneck AXTI . This is the holy grail of supply chain analysis materials research . Nobodys_posted about this stock here in the past 5 years youre welcome . Anyway I decided to max OTM some spare change on Calls last Friday because theres a low chance this goes from $ 15 to $ 150 if we see the same memory supply stock in 2026 . I will buy more shares on Monday when markets open up but wanted to share this at the start as proof . NFI theres a chance China sends this to $ 0 with export controls so dont follow along I just wanted to share my thoughts . But if this goes to $ 0 so does the entire growth phase of the AI buildout . I just thought this could also easily be a $ 7B company given they control 13rd of the worlds entire substrate capacity and then 14th of the worlds entire materials used for AI buildout . Its a monopoly in mining refining substrate production . And a duopoly for InP substrate production and Indium Phosphide . I just wanted to share as proof in case this becomes legendary . TLDR THE ENTIRE AI INDUSTRY IS BOTTLENECKED TWO TIMES BY THE SAME COMPANY . FOUND THE SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE OF THE ENTIRE MANY TRILLION USD WESTERN AI BUILDOUT IS SOME $ 700m COMPANY CALLED AXTI WORTH LESS THAN SOME PRE REVENUE LLM STARTUP ."

      "selftext": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my “bags”. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn’t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. Why am I bullish on oil? Well, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order : 1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row). 2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing. 3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100. 4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1. 5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point. One of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. Here’s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. XOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN Anyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open it wouldn ’ t move it a needle . With that being said I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026 I believe that energy equities could outperform . Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $ 55 crude . Yes an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver . Read that again . Can it go lower Sure . Is it sustainable No_I think in hindsight this will have been obvious . Sometimes things are cheap enough . Why am I bullish on oil Well I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it . I will try to keep this short and concise . In no_particular order 1 . The massive supply glut is overstated and demand is not_as weak as forecasted either . Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 not that IEA has any real credibility . They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row . 2 . Most of the worlds oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale . There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked or is close . Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices contrary to what the Mango man wants their production will not_be growing . 3 . XLE makes up less than 3 % of SPY . Just going back to the historical average of 68 % would imply massive gains for the equities . The bullish case is not_necessairly dependent on crude hitting $ 100 . 4 . Seasonality . Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1 . 5 . Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point . One of my favorite boomers to listen to Rick Rule says that you dont need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities . He thinks XOM is selling at 60 % of NPV meaning at 40 % discount . Im personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant . The Canadian OG stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and Im betting that he will enable them . He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US OG names . Im also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks . Here ’ s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats . XOM CVX COP CNQ SU OXY DVN Anyways thats it for now . Im off to play some poker . See you degens on Monday ."

They had a decent quarter, ARR, Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price. I work in tech nationally. Every company that I talk to (from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet) are switching from VMWare to Nutanix. Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they’re bleeding customers now. The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that’s really only for MS customers who are only MS. This feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?",
