      "selftext": "I built a dividend portfolio over 3 years, and currently sitting at about 95k mostly dividend aristocrats, reits, some utilities but overall yield is around 3.2%, which gives me roughly 250 bucks monthly… It's stable and growing but the income feels really slow for the capital committed. I started researching option income strategies and the basic concept is just selling time decay instead of waiting for quarterly dividend payments so I spent 5 weeks paper trading before moving 20k from dividends to systematic credit spreads Results so far are pretty different, that 20k was generating about 50 bucks monthly in dividends but now it's generating 350 to 550 monthly selling weekly options, depending on the market conditions and how many trades hit targets, a massive income increase but obviously way more work and risk. What's interesting though is monthly consistency as dividends come quarterly but option premium comes weekly, sometimes daily so it feels more like actual income stream instead of waiting 3 months between payments, the psychological difference is bigger than I expected as well For people who shifted from dividend income to premium income, what percentage feels right? I am thinking maybe 30% in options max, keeping 70% in stable dividends but I'm curious what allocation others landed on after testing both approaches.",

The group chat is filled with AI bots messaging around. it's to add legitimacy. 4. They will suggest you stocks. After you buy them, the advisor will ask you to provide screenshots. Q: Why do they ask you for screenshots? A: It's to make you accustomed to the process. They don't need screenshots of the transactions for their normal stock suggestions. It's useless for them. The only time they need it is when they finally advertise their pump and dump scam stock. They require the screenshots of the transactions so they can figure out how much money they scammed out of you to get a cut. 5. After 2 months regular stock recommendations.

Any tips or experience? perhaps some passive income strategies even if the passive income is nominal but ensures the land gets taken care of and not ruined,abused or squatted on. For reference I'm thinking around $500k for parcels of a few tens of acres in the midwest. Have just been looking at online listings. Practically with my job I'd only go check up on the parcel once a month, what I'm currently seeing are raw with some timber or farmland parcels and I'm not interested in actually farming on it myself, I wanna keep it for decade+ or even pass down to family as something tangible. Property taxes are very nomial in the areas I'm looking at (for now as I see). Nothing of this plan is set in stone so I'd appreciate experiences of any land investors.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m honestly shaken right now and trying to figure out what steps to take next. Tonight, while trading on Polymarket, I got hit with what looks like a major UI glitch that caused me to lose $19,000 instantly. I’m not talking about a bad trade or volatility this was the platform malfunctioning. placed what was supposed to be a small $1,900 order on a BTC-related market. Nothing crazy. But right after submitting, the platform completely bugged out and somehow executed a massive position that I NEVER placed. Instead of the $1.9k I intended, it ended up exposing me to almost $19,000, and I got instantly wrecked. To be clear: * I only clicked a $1.9k Buy * The UI was lagging / showing incorrect data at the time * The moment I pressed confirm, the UI froze * When it finally updated, the order that executed was NOT the one I placed * I checked the transaction — it’s way bigger than what I submitted * Price movement after execution locked in the loss before I could do anything This feels like a huge UI bug or backend mismatch, not user error. I’ve traded enough to know what I clicked, and the platform didn’t execute my intended order at all. I immediately opened a support ticket, but I’m worried I’ll just get brushed off with “the blockchain is final” even though the platform mis-executed the trade. Has anyone else had something like this on Polymarket? Did they ever compensate people for UI glitches or misfires? I’m not trying to blame the market. I’m blaming the platform failing and turning a $1.9k trade into a $19k disaster. Any advice or similar experiences would help a lot. Right now I’m stressing hard.",

Tonight while trading on Polymarket I got hit with what looks like a major UI glitch that caused me to lose $ 19000 instantly . I ’ m not_talking about a bad trade or volatility this was the platform malfunctioning . placed what was supposed to be a small $ 1900 order on a BTCrelated market . Nothing_crazy . But right after submitting the platform completely bugged out and somehow executed a massive position that I NEVER_placed . Instead of the $ 1.9k I intended it ended up exposing me to almost $ 19000 and I got instantly wrecked . To be clear I only clicked a $ 1.9k Buy The UI was lagging showing incorrect data at the time The moment I pressed confirm the UI froze When it finally updated the order that executed was NOT_the one I placed I checked the transaction — it ’ s way bigger than what I submitted Price movement after execution locked in the loss before I could do anything This feels like a huge UI bug or backend mismatch not_user error . I ’ ve traded enough to know what I clicked and the platform didn ’ t execute my intended order at all . I immediately opened a support ticket but I ’ m worried I ’ ll just get brushed off with “ the blockchain is final ” even though the platform misexecuted the trade . Has anyone else had something like this on Polymarket Did they ever compensate people for UI glitches or misfires I ’ m not_trying to blame the market . I ’ m blaming the platform failing and turning a $ 1.9k trade into a $ 19k disaster . Any advice or similar experiences would help a lot . Right now I ’ m stressing hard ."

      "selftext": "Hey All, TLDR: MT $70 target book value / fundamental value. Catalysts are huge technical breakout, perfect alignment of fundamentals, and possible gasoline on the fire if the Ukraine war ends, or possible announcements on rare earths like everybody else. They have a lot of mines. I have built a bit of a specialization in steel stocks. Caught the huge run in NUE in 21', the X buyout in '23, and again when it went through among some other trades. I thought I'd share my latest trade idea. Mittal Steel is the largest global steel company outside of China with operations globally. Weekly Chart: Massive breakout and trading at a 12 year high. Global profile in 2nd screen shot. General notes below. 1. MT 1. Target: $70 18X Long Run Earnings conservative, $70.75 Book Value 2. Q EPS Growth: 31.36% 255.75% (14.18%) 86.85% 3. Q REV Growth: 3.03% (1.99%) (9.11%) 1.11% 4. Next Q EPS: 31%, 9%, -5%, 61% 5. Next Q REV: 7%, 3% next two years 6. Catalysts: 7. Technicals 1. Technicals very strong. Trading at a decade high. Huge breakout 2. IWM huge long term breakout 3. Fed QE 4. Long hated stock 8. Fundamentals 1. Probably 2nd best run steel company globally after Steel Dynamics 2. Bought back almost 40% of shares in the last 5 years. Huge ongoing buybacks. 3. USA, EU, Canada Protections and more seem to be coming to keep China steel out. Everywhere MT operates is looking to protect their industry. 4. And over the last four years combined, capital spending amounted to $15.49 billion resulting in $1.9 billion in through cycle EBITDA coming (step change in profitability), Very Cheap, 5. M&A target (BHP, RIO, NUE?), 50% of FCF going to buying back shares. Nearly 40% in the last few years. Nice dividend. 6. China steel exports may or may not be sustainable. Iron ore prices rising. Massive China Stimulus + recovering market. 7. Number 1 global volume outside of China which everybody is putting tariffs on. 8. Trading 1/2 of Revenue, 63% of Book Value 9. Europe waking up. Massive German/Europe Stimulus. Global stimulus. Back to strength globally from trough? Europe Anti dumping cases. 22% USA Profits. 10. Drove at least $3-4 in value taking over Calvert a huge plant when the Nippon deal to acquire U.S. Steel went through. . Strongest price action of all steel companies. New market leader. 9. Catalysts 1. Massive Technical Breakout + Fundamental factors above. 2. If the Ukraine War Ends we will pop massively due to huge steel demand to rebuild. MT has extensive Ukraine and EU assets. 3. Any mention of rare earths it could rocket even if it is a gimmick. Positions",

      "selftext": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Self-driving Waymo taxis have gone viral for negative reasons involving the death of a beloved San Francisco bodega cat and pulling an illegal U-turn in front of police who were unable to issue a ticket to a nonexistent driver. But this week, the self-driving taxis are the bearer of happier news after a San Francisco woman gave birth in a Waymo. The mother was on her way to the University of California, San Francisco medical center Monday when she delivered inside the robotaxi, said a Waymo spokesperson in a statement Wednesday. The company said its rider support team detected “unusual activity” inside the vehicle and called to check on the rider as well as alert 911. Waymo, which is owned by Google’s parent company, Alphabet, declined to elaborate on how the vehicle knew something was amiss. The taxi and its passengers arrived safely at the hospital ahead of emergency services. Jess Berthold, a UCSF spokesperson, confirmed the mother and child were brought to the hospital. She said the mother was not available for interviews. Waymo said the vehicle was taken out of service for cleaning after the ride. While still rare, this was not the first baby delivered in one of its taxis, the company said.",

But this week the selfdriving taxis are the bearer of happier news after a San Francisco woman gave birth in a Waymo . The mother was on her way to the University of California San Francisco medical center Monday when she delivered inside the robotaxi said a Waymo spokesperson in a statement Wednesday . The company said its rider support team detected “ unusual activity ” inside the vehicle and called to check on the rider as well as alert 911 . Waymo which is owned by Google ’ s parent company Alphabet declined to elaborate on how the vehicle knew something was amiss . The taxi and its passengers arrived safely at the hospital ahead of emergency services . Jess Berthold a UCSF spokesperson confirmed the mother and child were brought to the hospital . She said the mother was not_available for interviews . Waymo said the vehicle was taken out of service for cleaning after the ride . While still rare this was not_the first baby delivered in one of its taxis the company said ."

According to the data: • Birkin bags: 14.2% annual return • S&P 500: 9.8% annual return • S&P 500 (total returns): 12.7% • Gold: 3.4% The graphic claimed that Birkin bags on the secondary market actually beat both the S&P 500 and gold over that 35 year period. I know luxury goods can appreciate, but I didn’t realize Birkins historically outperformed major asset classes by that much. Obviously they’re not as liquid, and authentication/condition matters a lot, but still… pretty wild. What do you all think? Is investing in Birkins a legit strategy, or is this cherry picked data / survivorship bias? Anyone here actually invest in luxury handbags as part of their portfolio?",

      "selftext": "Summary: 12/10/25 Market Cap: 3.3 Trillion ($3,300,000,000,000) Bitcoin $92K - ($92,000) Ethereum $3.3K - ($3,300) I wanted to know if anyone had collected the same data in the previous few weeks. I might be a little off, and the data might be outdated and inconclusive. Is sharing it with the community safe? I'm taking a risk, but this is what I've read and learned. Please correct me if I'm mistaken. 1. The Federal Reserve Rate Cut: (-.25%) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting today, December 10, 2025, by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5%-3.75%. The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorter-term Treasury securities. Key Decisions and Implications: ⦁ Interest Rate Cut: This is the third consecutive quarter-point rate cut this year. This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy, though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns. ⦁ Bond Purchases (Balance Sheet Policy): The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorter-term Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves. This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening (QT), meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet. This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system, which were showing signs of stress in the repo (repurchase agreement) market. Perspective: BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down -25% (75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025) ⦁ Short term treasuries, quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated (FOMC Chairman) 2. Artificial Intelligence: Nvidia swinging (November) $195 -> $170 -> $183 today ⦁ AI companies (TOP 7) are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events: ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30% recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently. New players are IE. (JPMorgan, Vanguard, Schwab, Morgan Stanley.) ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95% Random Bears Events: ⦁ Government - Shutdown 43 days - influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs - No November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment - Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs - Taxing everyone Random Thoughts: Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service. There are 21,000,000 coins and 95% have been mined. An unknown number of coins have been lost forever. Imagine there are 8,200,000,000 (8.2 billion) humans on earth today. 1 of 4 are Chinese. (25% people on EARTH) 2,000,000,000 (2.0 billion) Chinese. Put this into perspective China are not pro crypto, nor is it legal since its ban in 2021. Meaning, in China you can be literally hanged, if not imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto. Yet, you can mine in China, as they are #3 in the world in this field. The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly, not 2 billion dollars. This number is trillions. Possibly more than gold. It's almost like they are the little kid who can't play with the big kids when playing sports. They are hindered by the government's choices for freedom of investments.",

I might be a little off and the data might be outdated and inconclusive . Is sharing it with the community safe Im taking a risk but this is what Ive read and learned . Please correct me if Im mistaken . 1 . The Federal Reserve Rate Cut .25 % Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting today December 10 2025 by cutting its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to a range of 3.5 % 3.75 % . The Fed also initiated the purchase of shorterterm Treasury securities . Key Decisions and Implications ⦁ Interest Rate Cut This is the third consecutive quarterpoint rate cut this year . This move aims to support the labor market amidst a slowing economy though it has faced some dissent among FOMC members due to lingering inflation concerns . ⦁ Bond Purchases Balance Sheet Policy The Committee announced it will initiate purchases of shorterterm Treasury securities as needed to maintain an ample supply of bank reserves . This follows an earlier decision in October to cease quantitative tightening QT meaning the Fed will now roll over all maturing securities instead of letting them run off its balance sheet . This shift is a technical adjustment to manage reserve levels within the banking system which were showing signs of stress in the repo repurchase agreement market . Perspective BULLISH 🙂 ⦁ Down 25 % 75 basis points total and a total of three cuts in 2025 ⦁ Short term treasuries quantitative tightening ⦁ Jerome Powell is terminated FOMC Chairman 2 . Artificial Intelligence Nvidia swinging November $ 195 $ 170 $ 183 today ⦁ AI companies TOP 7 are being challenged by smaller competitors ⦁ Remember Deep Seek fears from a China competitor ⦁ Nvidia challenged by Google Gemini buyers from Meta data centers ⦁ No_quantum computing technology to break encryption coding Random Bulls Events ⦁ Worldwide cartel wallets were liquidated during the drop of 30 % recently in crypto ⦁ Financial Institutions are offering ETFs stocks through pro crypto recently . New players are IE . JPMorgan Vanguard Schwab Morgan Stanley . ⦁ Michael Saylor offering a 12 year cycle explanation now that the mining has capped 95 % Random Bears Events ⦁ Government Shutdown 43 days influenced the market heavily in all aspects ⦁ Jobs No_November or December job reports or accuracy ⦁ Unemployment Raised over the past two years ⦁ Tariffs Taxing everyone Random Thoughts Bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency validated and still in service . There are 21000000 coins and 95 % have been mined . An unknown number of coins have been lost forever . Imagine there are 8200000000 8.2 billion humans on earth today . 1 of 4 are Chinese . 25 % people on EARTH 2000000000 2.0 billion Chinese . Put this into perspective China are not_pro crypto nor is it legal since its ban in 2021 . Meaning in China you can be literally hanged if not_imprisoned for 10 years when trading crypto . Yet you can mine in China as they are 3 in the world in this field . The crypto market is down 2 billion users possibly not_2 billion dollars . This number is trillions . Possibly more than gold . Its almost like they are the little kid who cant play with the big kids when playing sports . They are hindered by the governments choices for freedom of investments ."

      "selftext": "Oracle shares fell about 5% on Wednesday after the database software maker reported lower quarterly revenue than expected. Here’s how the company did in comparison with LSEG consensus: Earnings per share: $2.26 adjusted vs. $1.64 expected Revenue: $16.06 billion vs. $16.21 billion expected Oracle’s revenue grew 14% year over year in the quarter that ended Nov. 30, according to a statement. Net income, at $6.14 billion, or $2.14 per share, rose from $3,151 billion, or $1.13 per share, in the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings exclude stock-based compensation. The company posted $7.98 billion in cloud revenue, more than the $7.92 consensus among analysts polled by StreetAccount. Cloud infrastructure revenue totaled $4.1 billion. Remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted revenue that hasn’t yet been recognized, soared 438% to $523 billion, topping the $501.8 billion average analyst estimate, according to StreetAccount. Doug Kehring, Oracle’s principal financial officer, said in the release that RPO were driven “by new commitments from Meta, Nvidia and others.” The stock plummeted 23% in November, its worst monthly performance since 2001 and, as of Wednesday’s close, is 32% below its record reached in September. Still, the shares are up 34% for the year, outperforming the Nasdaq, which has gained 22% over that stretch. Oracle generated $5.88 billion in software revenue, down 3% and lower than StreetAccount’s $6.06 billion consensus. Source:",

Demand for metals like copper, nickel, lithium, silver, and rare earths is rising due to military technology, AI infrastructure, robotics, and electrification. Strong gold and silver prices further support exploration budgets. This is expected to drive junior and senior mining companies to drill extensively. Major Drilling benefits as a global market leader with 45 years of experience in precision core drilling, and its archaeology services provide an edge in permitting and community relations. During the 2010 cycle, the stock traded at 21 CAD. Adjusting for the US M2 money supply expansion of about 2.79 times since 2007 gives a conservative price target of roughly 33 to 36 CAD. The theoretical peak adjusted for money supply would be above 58 CAD. Current price is around 13.60 CAD, with a market cap of approximately 1.1 billion CAD. The next earnings report on December 10 could act as a catalyst. Risks include exploration cycle volatility, execution challenges with fleet and labor expansion, and macroeconomic slowdowns that could delay project starts. Nfa. Dyor.",

This discrepancy suggests increased variance of positions across the board. If the actual neutral rate is lower than 3.50%–3.75%, the Fed may be passively tightening, leading to a slower growth outlook. If the market believes the Fed is now neutral, it may expect rate cuts only if the economy shows clear signs distress, or drop in inflation. * The bar for future rate cuts is now higher. The Fed may be willing to hold rates at this level for an extended period, which could push up longer-term yields.

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve cut interest rates again on Wednesday, but the decision came with unusually visible internal disagreement. The FOMC lowered the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to a 3.5%–3.75% range. While the move was widely expected, the tone around the announcement was far more cautious than markets were hoping for. The vote itself highlighted how divided policymakers have become. Three members dissented the most since 2019. Governor Stephen Miran pushed for a larger half-point cut, while Kansas City’s Jeffrey Schmid and Chicago’s Austan Goolsbee argued for no cut at all. That split essentially captures the Fed’s current dilemma: one camp is growing more concerned about weakening labor data, while the other worries that easing too fast could reignite inflation. This is Miran’s third straight dissent ahead of his January departure, and Schmid’s second. The mixed messaging reinforces the idea that although cuts are happening, the path forward may be slower and bumpier than markets expected. The Fed is easing, but not without hesitation and not without signaling that future moves are far from guaranteed. Source:",

      "title": "The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You",
      "selftext": "# The Broken Yardstick: Why Your “Historic” P/E Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘AI bubble’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days. If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the S&P 500’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio. The current multiple looks elevated, compared against a long-term average of \\~15/16x. The conclusion is always the same: “The market is expensive. A mean reversion is inevitable. We are in an AI bubble.” Let me start by making clear, this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples, not to say the market PE isn’t elevated. **I am not saying that ‘this time is different’… BUT some things are different. Notably, the accounting rules we use to define the ‘E’ in P/E.”** Comparing the S&P500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is apples-to-oranges comparison. This common comparison assumes that the “E” (Earnings) in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “E” in 2025. It doesn’t. Over the last two decades, there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits. Almost every single change has made today’s accounting more conservative, suppressing reported earnings compared to the past. Those changes were made for a reason, much of today’s accounting is more transparent, it is more rational, but it makes comparison cloudy. Let’s look at what’s changed and what the impact has been… # The SBC Distortion: The Core 10-15% Earnings Drag: The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stock-based compensation (SBC). Did you know that stock-based compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006? Before 2006, companies could issue massive stock options, dilute shareholders, and report zero expense on the income statement. SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share (EPS). That ended with **FAS 123(R)**, which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other share-based payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes. Today, rightfully so, SBC is a required, non-cash, impact on earnings. It belongs in the income statement as an expense. Buffett and Munger agree, commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter, prior to the accounting rule changes described above. \"A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not yet received an answer: “If options aren’t a form of compensation, what are they? If compensation isn’t an expense, what is it? And, if expenses shouldn’t go into the calculation of earnings, where in the world should they go?”\" (Cool Note: Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time, opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders, voluntarily.) **On the change:** \"Though the two (incentive) plans are an economic wash, the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result. This Alice-in-Wonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated, even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations. In effect, accounting principles offer management a choice: Pay employees in one form and count the cost, or pay them in another form and ignore the cost. Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed.\" (Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost.) **The Impact:** SBC now accounts for roughly **10-15%** of total S&P 500 earnings. If we reverted to 1999 rules, we would add that expense right back into the bottom line, drastically increasing bottom line earnings. Here’s a real world example. Let’s look at **Microsoft ($MSFT)** using current numbers (Q3 2025 Numbers). Looking at the financials, we can see the SBC impact on its valuation. **Current Numbers:** Price (12/6/25): $483.15 Market Cap: \\~$3.59 trillion TTM Net Income: $104.91 billion Diluted EPS: $14.1 GAAP PE: \\~34.26x **Pre-2006 Accounting Adjustment:** TTM Stock Based Compensation: $12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income (excluding SBC): $104.91b + $12.12b = $117.03b (-12.12% expense) Adjusted PE Ratio: \\~30.6x or a roughly 11% discount Now let’s look at **Microsoft ($MSFT)** during the 2000 peak. **Reported Numbers 2000:** Market Cap (Peak): \\~$600 billion Reported Operating Income: $11b Reported Net Income: \\~9.4 billion Diluted EPS: $1.70 Headline PE: \\~62.82x **Adjusted Numbers (applying current day accounting rules):** Market Cap (Peak): \\~$600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC: $9.11b *(-17.2% impact)* Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC: \\~8.1b *(-13% impact)* Diluted EPS: $1.57 *(-12.9% impact)* Adjusted PE: \\~74.07x # MSFT 2001 and 2002: The gap widens… **2001:** Reported Operating Income: $11.72b vs. Pro Forma: $8.34b *(-28.8% impact)* Reported Net Income: $7.35b vs Pro Forma: $5.08b *(-30.9% impact)* Reported Diluted EPS: $1.32 vs Pro Forma: $0.91 *(-31.1% impact)* Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $73.68 **Headline ‘reported’ PE: 55.81x** vs **Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 80.96x** **2002:** Reported Operating Income: $11.91b vs. Pro Forma: $8.27b (-30.6% impact) Reported Net Income: $7.83b vs Pro Forma: $5.36b *(-31.5% impact)* Reported Diluted EPS: $1.41 vs Pro Forma: $0.98 *(-30.5% impact)* Quarter Ending June 30, 2001 High Price: $60.38 **Headline ‘reported’ PE: 42.82x** vs **Adjusted PE (current day SBC accounting): 63.65x** When you take required reporting changes into account, the picture changes. # But SBC isn’t the only accounting change holding back earnings... Regarding Intangibles: Beyond SBC, the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the S&P500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets (factories, plants, equipment) to intangible assets (IP, software) and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation. For reference: Back in 1975, intangible assets made up just 17% of assets on the balance sheets of S&P 500 companies. Less than 50 years later, intangible assets exceed 90% of total assets on balance sheets. This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the S&P 500 by market capitalization. While Goodwill amortization went away, in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new, massive expense: Amortization of Definite-Lived Intangibles. When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B, a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets (Patents, Developed Technology, Customer Lists, etc.) Unlike Goodwill, these MUST be amortized. Because M&A volume is so much higher today (and tech valuations are higher), this amortization expense has exploded. **For the S&P 500, this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP (reported) earnings and Non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings, amounting to over $140 Billion per year in expenses.** In other words, that is a -6% drag on the S&P 500s net income, further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods. # Regarding R&D and the ‘Missing Amortization’: The US economic and S&P500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a tech/innovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples. The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts. This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic. Keep in mind, we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “capex light” tech companies are becoming more “capex heavy,” yet, the point still stands. **Old Economy:** If you build a factory, you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years. The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation. **New Economy (Software/Tech):** If you spend billions on R&D to build software, you must expense it immediately. Because Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Google spend massive amounts on R&D ($211B+ combined annually as of FY2024), their reported earnings are impacted immediately, where an industrial company re-investing in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades, drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings. According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin: \"The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets. Accounting, the means by which financial information is presented, treats tangible and intangible investments differently. This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings. Most intangible investments appear on the income statement. Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures. The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount. This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company’s operations. Given the assumptions we use, **the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the S&P 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported.** These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time.\" Taking this into account, earnings would be higher than 12% currently and the PE Ratio would be lower. So, while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization, they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of R&D and the amortization of acquired tech. The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules. # But What Even Is the S&P 500? Finally, let’s address the common complaint about the index itself: “The S&P 500 is too top-heavy. The market is so concentrated.” Somewhere along the way, the S&P 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself, serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market. But the S&P500 is a market-cap weighted index by design. It is not meant to be a representation of the average business; it is a momentum strategy. The index is built to reward our economy’s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers. When people complain that “the Mag7 is driving the index” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended. I see so many arguments that the “Mag 7” (Microsoft, Apple, Google, Nvidia, etc.) are distorting the market. But looking at them as just “7 stocks” is a mistake. They are diversified conglomerates. The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70. * **Amazon** is a retailer, a logistics company, an advertising agency, and a Cloud hyperscaler, that is building satellites and working on robots… * **Microsoft** is enterprise SaaS, Cloud hyperscaler, Gaming studio. * **Google** is a Cloud hyperscaler, leading AI developer, the largest search business, advertiser, streaming service, AV operator, soon to be TPU business. These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not because of hype, but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products, services, and financial results to match. Their net profit margins hover around **\\~26%**, roughly **double** the S&P 500 average of **\\~13%**. They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion. The S&P500 Index is not your only access to the stock market. You are not a forced buyer. Viewing the S&P 500 as the only “investable universe” is misleading. We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research. No one is forcing you to buy the market-cap weighted index. Not happy with the composition? Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended. Worried about concentration? Buy the Equal Weight S&P 500. If you choose to buy the S&P500 index, you are making an active choice to bet on the winners. Stop being upset when they win. # Conclusion: The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn’t arguing “this time is different,” but rather that the accounting is different. To create a consistent comparison of S&P500 valuations, we have to level the playing field. Remember, this is an exercise in expanding your perspective. I strongly prefer today’s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation. In no way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed. What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different. Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market *really* looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s. Here is the step-by-step impact on the S&P 500 P/E ratio (currently \\~29x) if we revert to historical rules: **The “SBC” Adjustment** * *The Change:* We add back the mandatory 10-15% Stock-Based Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s. * *The Impact:* Earnings rise \\~12.5% (midpoint). * *The Result:* The P/E drops from **29x** to **\\~25.8x**. **The “R&D Innovation” Adjustment** * *The Change:* We keep the SBC add-back AND we capitalize R&D expenses (treating them as assets/investments like factories, rather than immediate costs). * *The Impact:* As noted by Morgan Stanley, this boosts earnings by another \\~12%. * *The Result:* The P/E drops from **25.8x** to **\\~23.0x**. **A “Full Scope” Adjustment** * *The Change:* We include the above, PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through M&A. * *The Impact:* We add back a conservative \\~3% drag (discounting from the full 6% to account for historical M&A activity). * *The Result:* The P/E drops from **23.0x** to **\\~22.3x**. **The Reverse Adjustment: Today’s accounting applied to the past** Finally, let’s look at it the other way. What happens if we take the historical markets of the dot-com era and apply today’s accounting rules? * If we applied today’s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak, earnings would have been \\~10-20% lower. * The peak P/E of the Dot-Com bubble wasn’t 30x... by today’s standards it was **\\~34x - 38x**. When you compare a 22.3 - 25.8x market (Adjusted Today) to a 34x+ market (Adjusted History), some of the bubble talk can subside. Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited all-time average of 16x. The market is trading at a premium, but, in my opinion, is not in a bubble. We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples. Thanks for reading. I hope you found this article interesting and helpful. Please let me know! \\-Manu",

      "selftext_processed": "The Broken Yardstick Why Your “ Historic ” PE Chart is Lying to You There is a lot of talk about an ‘ AI bubble ’ and elevated SP500 multiples these days . If you have spent any time in financial social media circles you have certainly seen a chart comparing a graph of the SP 500 ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio . The current multiple looks elevated compared against a longterm average of 1516x . The conclusion is always the same “ The market is expensive . A mean reversion is inevitable . We are in an AI bubble. ” Let me start by making clear this post is intended to provide some perspective and insight into the context of the current multiples not_to say the market PE isn ’ t elevated . I am not_saying that ‘ this time is different ’ … BUT some things are different . Notably the accounting rules we use to define the ‘ E ’ in PE. ” Comparing the SP500 PE ratio of today to that of the past is applestooranges comparison . This common comparison assumes that the “ E ” Earnings in the 1990s and early 2000s measures the same thing as the “ E ” in 2025 . It doesn ’ t . Over the last two decades there have been several major accounting changes that have changed the way companies report profits . Almost every single change has made today ’ s accounting more conservative suppressing reported earnings compared to the past . Those changes were made for a reason much of today ’ s accounting is more transparent it is more rational but it makes comparison cloudy . Let ’ s look at what ’ s changed and what the impact has been… The SBC Distortion The Core 1015 % Earnings Drag The major difference of now vs then is the way GAAP requires companies to account for stockbased compensation SBC . Did you know that stockbased compensation was only required to be recorded as an expense as of 2006 Before 2006 companies could issue massive stock options dilute shareholders and report zero expense on the income statement . SBC prior to 2006 has zero impact on Earnings Per Share EPS . That ended with FAS 123R which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other sharebased payments on their income statements instead of just disclosing it in footnotes . Today rightfully so SBC is a required noncash impact on earnings . It belongs in the income statement as an expense . Buffett and Munger agree commenting on it in the 1998 Shareholder Letter prior to the accounting rule changes described above . A few years ago we asked three questions in these pages to which we have not_yet received an answer “ If options aren ’ t a form of compensation what are they If compensation isn ’ t an expense what is it And if expenses shouldn ’ t go into the calculation of earnings where in the world should they go ” Cool Note Berkshire terminated their stock options program at this time opting to pay cash incentives so that their financials reporting reflected the true expense to their shareholders voluntarily . On the change Though the two incentive plans are an economic wash the cash plan we are putting in will produce a vastly different accounting result . This AliceinWonderland outcome occurs because existing accounting principles ignore the cost of stock options when earnings are being calculated even though options are a huge and increasing expense at a great many corporations . In effect accounting principles offer management a choice Pay employees in one form and count the cost or pay them in another form and ignore the cost . Small wonder then that the use of options has mushroomed . Berkshire voluntarily chose to count the cost . The Impact SBC now accounts for roughly 1015 % of total SP 500 earnings . If we reverted to 1999 rules we would add that expense right back into the bottom line drastically increasing bottom line earnings . Here ’ s a real world example . Let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT using current numbers Q3 2025 Numbers . Looking at the financials we can see the SBC impact on its valuation . Current Numbers Price 12625 $ 483.15 Market Cap $ 3.59 trillion TTM Net Income $ 104.91 billion Diluted EPS $ 14.1 GAAP PE 34.26x Pre2006 Accounting Adjustment TTM Stock Based Compensation $ 12.12 billion Adjusted Net Income excluding SBC $ 104.91b $ 12.12b $ 117.03b 12.12 % expense Adjusted PE Ratio 30.6x or a roughly 11 % discount Now let ’ s look at Microsoft $ MSFT during the 2000 peak . Reported Numbers 2000 Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Reported Operating Income $ 11b Reported Net Income 9.4 billion Diluted EPS $ 1.70 Headline PE 62.82x Adjusted Numbers applying current day accounting rules Market Cap Peak $ 600 billion Pro Forma Footnote Operating Income to adjust for SBC $ 9.11b 17.2 % impact Pro Forma Footnote Net Income to adjust for SBC 8.1b 13 % impact Diluted EPS $ 1.57 12.9 % impact Adjusted PE 74.07x MSFT 2001 and 2002 The gap widens… 2001 Reported Operating Income $ 11.72b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.34b 28.8 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.35b vs Pro Forma $ 5.08b 30.9 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.32 vs Pro Forma $ 0.91 31.1 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 73.68 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 55.81x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 80.96x 2002 Reported Operating Income $ 11.91b vs . Pro Forma $ 8.27b 30.6 % impact Reported Net Income $ 7.83b vs Pro Forma $ 5.36b 31.5 % impact Reported Diluted EPS $ 1.41 vs Pro Forma $ 0.98 30.5 % impact Quarter Ending June 30 2001 High Price $ 60.38 Headline ‘ reported ’ PE 42.82x vs Adjusted PE current day SBC accounting 63.65x When you take required reporting changes into account the picture changes . But SBC isn ’ t the only accounting change holding back earnings ... Regarding Intangibles Beyond SBC the American economy has changed and the companies that make up the SP500 have shifted from companies with tangible assets factories plants equipment to intangible assets IP software and current day accounting rules penalize this shift in regards to valuation . For reference Back in 1975 intangible assets made up just 17 % of assets on the balance sheets of SP 500 companies . Less than 50 years later intangible assets exceed 90 % of total assets on balance sheets . This is due to the domination of software in the economy and tech companies becoming the heaviest weighted sector in the SP 500 by market capitalization . While Goodwill amortization went away in 2002 a new accounting rule replaced it with a new massive expense Amortization of DefiniteLived Intangibles . When Tech Company A buys Tech Company B a large percentage of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets Patents Developed Technology Customer Lists etc . Unlike Goodwill these MUST be amortized . Because MA volume is so much higher today and tech valuations are higher this amortization expense has exploded . For the SP 500 this is now often the single largest adjustment between GAAP reported earnings and NonGAAP adjusted earnings amounting to over $ 140 Billion per year in expenses . In other words that is a 6 % drag on the SP 500s net income further compressing earnings and expanding multiples when compared to previous periods . Regarding RD and the ‘ Missing Amortization ’ The US economic and SP500 transition from a manufacturing capex heavy composition to a techinnovation driven composition also creates challenges for comparison of as reported earnings multiples . The companies and the economy have changed but the expensing of investment in research and development is treated very differently than investment in manufacturing buildouts . This may be the biggest distortion to current day earnings vs historic . Keep in mind we are obviously in a major capex cycle so many of the typically “ capex light ” tech companies are becoming more “ capex heavy ” yet the point still stands . Old Economy If you build a factory you capitalize the cost and depreciate it over 30 years . The hit to earnings is spread out via straight line depreciation . New Economy SoftwareTech If you spend billions on RD to build software you must expense it immediately . Because Amazon Microsoft Meta and Google spend massive amounts on RD $ 211B combined annually as of FY2024 their reported earnings are impacted immediately where an industrial company reinvesting in its business smooths out the cost over multiple decades drastically reducing the annual impact on earnings . According to a 2022 Morgan Stanley report by Michael Mauboussin The global economy continues to shift from one built on tangible assets to one built on intangible assets . Accounting the means by which financial information is presented treats tangible and intangible investments differently . This introduces bias into common metrics such as earnings . Most intangible investments appear on the income statement . Capitalizing those investments treats them in a fashion similar to capital expenditures . The result is that earnings and investments increase the same amount . This leaves free cash flow unchanged but provides a more accurate picture of a company ’ s operations . Given the assumptions we use the capitalization of intangible investments would lead to net income for the SP 500 that is about 12 percent higher than what is reported . These figures suggest great caution in comparing earnings or multiples over time . Taking this into account earnings would be higher than 12 % currently and the PE Ratio would be lower . So while reported earnings are benefiting from the lack of old school Goodwill amortization they are being impacted far more by the immediate expensing of RD and the amortization of acquired tech . The net result is that current PE ratios are overstated relative to history because the earnings are being conservatively suppressed new modern day accounting rules . But What Even Is the SP 500 Finally let ’ s address the common complaint about the index itself “ The SP 500 is too topheavy . The market is so concentrated. ” Somewhere along the way the SP 500 transitioned from being a passive tracking index of the US economy to an active financial product itself serving as the favorite proxy for the overall stock market . But the SP500 is a marketcap weighted index by design . It is not_meant to be a representation of the average business it is a momentum strategy . The index is built to reward our economy ’ s best companies by letting winners run and dropping the worst performers . When people complain that “ the Mag7 is driving the index ” they are essentially complaining that the winners are winning and that the strategy is working as intended . I see so many arguments that the “ Mag 7 ” Microsoft Apple Google Nvidia etc . are distorting the market . But looking at them as just “ 7 stocks ” is a mistake . They are diversified conglomerates . The Mag7 is more akin to the Mag70 . Amazon is a retailer a logistics company an advertising agency and a Cloud hyperscaler that is building satellites and working on robots… Microsoft is enterprise SaaS Cloud hyperscaler Gaming studio . Google is a Cloud hyperscaler leading AI developer the largest search business advertiser streaming service AV operator soon to be TPU business . These companies are the most diversified businesses in the world and rightfully command a higher multiple not_because of hype but because they delivering seemingly unimaginable products services and financial results to match . Their net profit margins hover around 26 % roughly double the SP 500 average of 13 % . They are twice as efficient at turning revenue into profit and their earnings growth is keeping pace with their multiple expansion . The SP500 Index is not_your only access to the stock market . You are not_a forced buyer . Viewing the SP 500 as the only “ investable universe ” is misleading . We live in the golden age of ETFs and individual access to stock market research . No_one is forcing you to buy the marketcap weighted index . Not_happy with the composition Stop viewing it as a product and view it as a tracking index as it initially was intended . Worried about concentration Buy the Equal Weight SP 500 . If you choose to buy the SP500 index you are making an active choice to bet on the winners . Stop being upset when they win . Conclusion The Normalizing Adjustment I started this post by saying I wasn ’ t arguing “ this time is different ” but rather that the accounting is different . To create a consistent comparison of SP500 valuations we have to level the playing field . Remember this is an exercise in expanding your perspective . I strongly prefer today ’ s accounting standards to those of the 1990s and use GAAP reported numbers as my baseline for company valuation . In no_way am I suggesting you to do otherwise or that things should be changed . What I am suggesting is that you view the comparison of current day financial reporting with that of the past with a holistic perspective and acknowledge that things are different . Lets strip away the layers of modern current day accounting changes to see what the market really looks like compared to the rules of the 1990s . Here is the stepbystep impact on the SP 500 PE ratio currently 29x if we revert to historical rules The “ SBC ” Adjustment The Change We add back the mandatory 1015 % StockBased Compensation expense that was hidden in the 90s . The Impact Earnings rise 12.5 % midpoint . The Result The PE drops from 29x to 25.8x . The “ RD Innovation ” Adjustment The Change We keep the SBC addback AND we capitalize RD expenses treating them as assetsinvestments like factories rather than immediate costs . The Impact As noted by Morgan Stanley this boosts earnings by another 12 % . The Result The PE drops from 25.8x to 23.0x . A “ Full Scope ” Adjustment The Change We include the above PLUS we adjust for the aggressive amortization of acquired intangibles through MA . The Impact We add back a conservative 3 % drag discounting from the full 6 % to account for historical MA activity . The Result The PE drops from 23.0x to 22.3x . The Reverse Adjustment Today ’ s accounting applied to the past Finally let ’ s look at it the other way . What happens if we take the historical markets of the dotcom era and apply today ’ s accounting rules If we applied today ’ s SBC expensing rules to the 2000 peak earnings would have been 1020 % lower . The peak PE of the DotCom bubble wasn ’ t 30x ... by today ’ s standards it was 34x 38x . When you compare a 22.3 25.8x market Adjusted Today to a 34x market Adjusted History some of the bubble talk can subside . Especially when you acknowledge that the average PE of the last 50 years is 19.5x vs the often cited alltime average of 16x . The market is trading at a premium but in my opinion is not_in a bubble . We are in the midst of a technological revolution and company earnings are driving their multiples . Thanks for reading . I hope you found this article interesting and helpful . Please let me know Manu"

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year? Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026, but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak? A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year. For example, Deutsche Bank set their S&P 500 target at 8,000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex, corporate earnings growth, and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up. Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy, the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates, fiscal policy, and a rebound in more traditional sectors. Put simply, the bulls believe，AI is no longer just a hype story it’s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth. As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there’s still liquidity in the market, stocks could keep climbing. But I’m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive, and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that, the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off, the entire market could get hit hard. And then there’s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties. This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy. History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment, politics, or interest rates no matter how strong the bull feels. So here’s my approach going into 2026， I’ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future, but I’m not going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “high upside but high risk” long term bet. The rest stays diversified cyclicals, value, defensive names, low valuation sectors as the hedge.I’m not putting all my hopes into a single sector. And mentally, I’m prepared If tech swings hard, I’m not going to panic sell or blindly average down. If valuations correct to a reasonable level, I’d consider buying more in small batches. So what about you?For the 2026 U.S. market, are you leaning more toward:the bull continues”or sharp pullback ， big volatility”? Will you keep betting on tech and AI? Or play it safer with more defensive positioning? What kind of split would you choose? And which risks worry you the most",

      "selftext_processed": "Lately I ’ ve been thinking about one big question Is there still room for the market to run next year Wall Street is getting pretty bullish about 2026 but I keep wondering is this bull run going to continue or are we already at the peak A bunch of investment banks are betting that U.S. stocks could push higher next year . For example Deutsche Bank set their SP 500 target at 8000 by the end of 2026 saying AI driven capex corporate earnings growth and fresh capital inflows could fuel another big leg up . Morgan Stanley thinks even if tech stocks get choppy the overall market could still perform well thanks to rates fiscal policy and a rebound in more traditional sectors . Put simply the bulls believe，AI is no_longer just a hype story it ’ s actually turning into the foundation of economic and corporate growth . As long as AI keeps improving efficiency and there ’ s still liquidity in the market stocks could keep climbing . But I ’ m also seeing some big red flags Most leading tech and AI names are already expensive and overall market valuations are pretty high too On top of that the market right now is way too dependent on a handful of mega cap tech names If those companies disappoint or the AI hype cools off the entire market could get hit hard . And then there ’ s 2026 which might come with a whole bunch of uncertainties . This current structure of high concentration high valuations weak diversification makes me uneasy . History shows that bull markets can get derailed quickly by changes in the macro environment politics or interest rates no_matter how strong the bull feels . So here ’ s my approach going into 2026， I ’ ll put some money into tech AI high growth ，I want exposure to the future but I ’ m not_going all in or buying at the top.That part is my “ high upside but high risk ” long term bet . The rest stays diversified cyclicals value defensive names low valuation sectors as the hedge.I ’ m not_putting all my hopes into a single sector . And mentally I ’ m prepared If tech swings hard I ’ m not_going to panic sell or blindly average down . If valuations correct to a reasonable level I ’ d consider buying more in small batches . So what about youFor the 2026 U.S. market are you leaning more towardthe bull continues ” or sharp pullback ， big volatility ” Will you keep betting on tech and AI Or play it safer with more defensive positioning What kind of split would you choose And which risks worry you the most"

      "title": "Tesla pushes closer to unsupervised FSD, offers Model Y incentives as stock ticks higher",
      "selftext": "Tesla shared updates this week suggesting that its unsupervised Full Self-Driving system is nearing completion, with Elon Musk saying the company is making meaningful progress toward removing the need for human supervision. Around the same time, Tesla also rolled out fresh incentives on the Model Y to support demand, which helped the stock move about 2.5% higher on the day. While neither development is completely new on its own FSD timelines have shifted before and incentives have been used frequently the combination of software progress and sales support seems to be keeping investor sentiment steady for now. It also highlights Tesla’s continued shift toward positioning itself as more than just an EV company, leaning further into AI and autonomy while trying to protect delivery volumes in a competitive market. Curious how others are viewing this: meaningful progress this time, or just another step in a long roadmap?",

Around the same time Tesla also rolled out fresh incentives on the Model Y to support demand which helped the stock move about 2.5 % higher on the day . While neither_development is completely new on its own FSD timelines have shifted before and incentives have been used frequently the combination of software progress and sales support seems to be keeping investor sentiment steady for now . It also highlights Tesla ’ s continued shift toward positioning itself as more than just an EV company leaning further into AI and autonomy while trying to protect delivery volumes in a competitive market . Curious how others are viewing this meaningful progress this time or just another step in a long roadmap"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Waymo, Alphabet Inc.’s self-driving tech unit, expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year, aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan. It’s the first time that the company, which started in 2009 as the Google Self-Driving Car project, has set a hard target for its business. >Currently, the Mountain View, California-based company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Bay Area communities, Austin, Atlanta and, as of last month, Miami. That’s “a number that we’re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026,” Waymo said in a blog post. “As we look to 2026, we’re laying the early groundwork for ride-hailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026, including international cities like Tokyo and London.” >Waymo doesn’t share financial data, but various estimates suggest it makes at least $20 per ride, which adds up to more than $20 million a month. At 1 million rides per week, its annualized revenue would hit about $1 billion, a milestone for the early-stage robotaxi market. To handle that volume of rides the company’s fleet will likely expand to at least 10,000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2,500 now, likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar I-Pace SUVs. >Though the service has proved popular with riders, Waymo’s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges. The company’s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco, for example, following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat, a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors. Last month, a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street. Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company, which hasn’t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans, needs to make additional safety upgrades. >Additionally, Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses. >“While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers, holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better,” Mauricio Peña, Waymo’s Waymo's chief safety officer, said in a statement. >That said, Waymo’s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space, including General Motors’ Cruise unit, which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco. Tesla, whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving, is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its so-called Full Self-Driving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use. Last week, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it’s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD. >But while Waymo’s safety issues so far haven’t been as serious, some critics think it’s expanding too fast, perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit. >“We are left to wonder why the \\`world’s most experienced driver’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience,” Phil Koopman, an autonomous driving researcher and Carnegie-Mellon University professor, said in a blog post. “Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can’t shrug off. It’s unclear which will happen first.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Waymo Alphabet Inc. ’ s selfdriving tech unit expects to more than quadruple its ride service over the next year aiming to handle at least a million paid robotaxi rides as it enters new cities in the U.S. and begins operating in the U.K. and Japan . It ’ s the first time that the company which started in 2009 as the Google SelfDriving Car project has set a hard target for its business . Currently the Mountain View Californiabased company books more than 1 million rides a week in Phoenix Los Angeles San Francisco and Bay Area communities Austin Atlanta and as of last month Miami . That ’ s “ a number that we ’ re on a path to hit every week by the end of 2026 ” Waymo said in a blog post . “ As we look to 2026 we ’ re laying the early groundwork for ridehailing operations in over 20 additional cities in 2026 including international cities like Tokyo and London. ” Waymo doesn ’ t share financial data but various estimates suggest it makes at least $ 20 per ride which adds up to more than $ 20 million a month . At 1 million rides per week its annualized revenue would hit about $ 1 billion a milestone for the earlystage robotaxi market . To handle that volume of rides the company ’ s fleet will likely expand to at least 10000 vehicles over the next year from more than 2500 now likely including electric Hyundai Ioniq 5 hatchbacks and Zeekr RT microvans in addition to its current Jaguar IPace SUVs . Though the service has proved popular with riders Waymo ’ s rapid growth is also bringing new challenges . The company ’ s reputation for safety has been tarnished in San Francisco for example following the accidental killing in October of Kit Kat a popular neighborhood cat that had crawled under one of its vehicles without being detected by sensors . Last month a Waymo taxi killed a small dog in San Francisco that ran into the street . Both incidents have raised questions about whether the company which hasn ’ t had serious accidents or fatalities involving humans needs to make additional safety upgrades . Additionally Waymo last week announced a fleetwide recall to upgrade software after reports that its robotaxis in Texas failed to stop when encountering parked school buses . “ While we are incredibly proud of our strong safety record showing Waymo experiences 12 times fewer injury crashes involving pedestrians than human drivers holding the highest safety standards means recognizing when our behavior should be better ” Mauricio Peña Waymo ’ s Waymos chief safety officer said in a statement . That said Waymo ’ s safety record has been better than that of competitors in the robotaxi space including General Motors ’ Cruise unit which was shut down a year ago after one of its vehicles struck a pedestrian in San Francisco . Tesla whose CEO Elon Musk claims is a leader in autonomous driving is dealing with ongoing legal issues related to its socalled Full SelfDriving feature and multiple accidents and fatalities linked to its use . Last week the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it ’ s expanding an ongoing probe of FSD . But while Waymo ’ s safety issues so far haven ’ t been as serious some critics think it ’ s expanding too fast perhaps ahead of a potential IPO of the unit . “ We are left to wonder why the world ’ s most experienced driver ’ still struggles to handle obviously foreseeable circumstances after 100 million miles of experience ” Phil Koopman an autonomous driving researcher and CarnegieMellon University professor said in a blog post . “ Waymo has every incentive to continue their expansion juggernaut using this same playbook until they get their IPO or they suffer a mishap they can ’ t shrug off . It ’ s unclear which will happen first ."

      "selftext": "I could use some feedback from a potential strategy I'm considering. For context, before the 2020 election I was fairly certain Biden would win the election, which would start a bullish cycle for domestic and other cannabis stocks based on the belief he would possibly legalize, or enact positive regulation in the sector vs a Trump election win. I built up a sizeable position and rode the wave to the 2021 highs of the cannabis sector and made a good profit. Now that the prices of MSOS and other cannabis stocks have fallen steeply since 2021 I'm considering opening a long dated MSOS ETF call dated for 2028 exp. My reasoning is that as we get closer to the 2028 election and IF (big if) a strong democratic candidate emerges that could possibly win the 2028 election, the cannabis sector will start another bull cycle in anticipation of this, and in anticipation of potential federal legalization promises or hints, and or SAFE banking act passage, and in general a democratic admin not hostile to the sector and pro-cannabis legislation. My thought is if I can open this long dated call which right now is not very expensive, by the time 2028 nears the call will possibly appreciate sharply going into the election and beyond. I'm interested to hear thoughts on this potential strategy. I am aware this thesis is based on a lot of uncertainty, and hinges on democrats winning the 2028 presidential election amongst many other things that could not come to pass.",

      "selftext": "I'm shorting this optimism. Everyone is glued to the screen waiting for the Fed to cut rates today, acting like it’s a foregone conclusion, and analysts are talking about S&P 500 hitting 7,500 in 2026. That's pure euphoria. I look at one stock: Tesla (TSLA). Michael Burry, the \"Big Short\" investor, recently called the company \"ridiculously overvalued,\" citing shareholder dilution from stock-based compensation (SBC) and no buyback program. 1 - The Growth Narrative is Broken: The stock's valuation requires insane, uninterrupted growth, but the truck design is already controversial, and the competition is accelerating. It has an AI valuation but is fundamentally a car company. 2 - The EPS Overestimation: The bottom-up EPS estimate for the S&P 500 for 2026 is currently \\$309.22. However, over the past 25 years, analysts have overestimated the final EPS number by an average of 6.2\\%. Applying that average means the final 2026 EPS might be closer to \\$290.11. This makes current high valuations extremely sensitive to any shock. The market is showing extreme crowding and a \"winner-takes-all\" dynamic right now. When the high-momentum stocks like TSLA and other AI names start the rotation, the correction will be deep. I'm taking profits today. I’m not saying crash, but 25-30% pullback in 2026 is my base case. Roast me. Important Note: I am not a financial advisor.

However over the past 25 years analysts have overestimated the final EPS number by an average of 6.2 % . Applying that average means the final 2026 EPS might be closer to $ 290.11 . This makes current high valuations extremely sensitive to any shock . The market is showing extreme crowding and a winnertakesall dynamic right now .

      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

The company said it has “not seen any substantiation” to support the claim. The allegation came from *The Information*, which reported that restricted Nvidia hardware had somehow made its way into China despite export controls. Nvidia’s response was short and direct, signaling that they don’t believe the report is backed by solid evidence at this point. This comes at a time when scrutiny around chip exports, enforcement, and possible leakages is already intense. If anything concrete does surface, it could have serious implications but for now, it’s still unproven. What do you think noise, or something regulators will dig into deeper? Source: [",

The company said it has “ not seen any substantiation ” to support the claim . The allegation came from The Information which reported that restricted Nvidia hardware had somehow made its way into China despite export controls . Nvidia ’ s response was short and direct signaling that they don ’ t believe the report is backed by solid evidence at this point . This comes at a time when scrutiny around chip exports enforcement and possible leakages is already intense .

      "selftext": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year’s market outlook will be. So let’s study Wall Street’s latest New Year forecasts together. The market has really been wild lately. One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia’s earnings, thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years, and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google. The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half. So the question is: how long can this wave last? After this round of Christmas gains, will next year keep taking off or fall flat? Every year end, those suit-and-tie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year. This year, I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish. Eternal bull market. The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank. They boldly claim the S&P 500 could reach 8000 points next year, nearly a 20% increase. Keep in mind, the S&P has already risen more than 10% this year, and they still want more. Why so optimistic? It basically comes down to two words: Artificial Intelligence. AI is no longer just a tech buzzword. It has become the engine of the entire capital market. Nvidia, Microsoft, Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI R&D. Capital expenditure is at record highs. Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution. But here’s the problem the S&P 500 is now trading at a 25x P/E ratio, while the historical average is just above 15. Isn’t that expensive? It definitely is. But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don’t expand further, they can stay high. Why? Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong. Money is still flowing into equities, corporate buybacks haven’t stopped, and earnings expectations are rising. They even predict that in In 2026, EPS could reach $320. Interestingly, Morgan Stanley is also bullish, targeting 7800 points, yet they didn’t buy the Magnificent Seven. Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market. They prefer small caps, consumer discretionary, healthcare, financials, and industrials. Why? Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors, and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods. This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase. More importantly, Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early. The logic is simple: if employment weakens, liquidity tightens, and risk assets fall, Powell won’t be able to hold he’ll have to pump liquidity back into the market. Once rates turn down, the valuation ceiling opens again. HSBC, Barclays, and UBS all agree. HSBC even said: who cares if there’s a bubble? The dot-com bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first. UBS even drew a bull scenario where the S&P hits 8400. But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation. Capital spending is no longer only on AI chips it’s spreading across more industries. From my perspective, the U.S. market is still the top priority next year, but we shouldn’t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump’s second year in office. You might not know this, but historically, the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks. In 2018, during Trump 1.0’s second year, the first half was great, then the market collapsed in the second half. The trade war began, tech stocks plunged, the VIX soared 70%, and even crypto and emerging markets crashed. And now? The script looks nearly identical. Policies change every day. Tariffs can hit at any time. Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes, the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers, retailers, and exporters lose sleep. Plus, the 2026 midterm elections are coming. Both parties will go all-out, meaning fiscal policy may freeze again, and market trust in the government will keep eroding. What’s worse, sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017. In the U.S., only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market. Materials, energy, real estate everything else is dropping. Europe isn’t much better. Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump. When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant, it signals a fragile market. If tech stocks cool off, the entire market could lose momentum instantly. So next year, political cycles, policy risks, and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won’t disappear. Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth. Wanting everything at once often ends badly. In my view, the script may look like this: First half: AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again. Second half: As midterm elections approach, policy noise increases, earnings get disrupted, and volatility returns. Whoever holds high valuation, low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is starting to ask what next year ’ s market outlook will be . So let ’ s study Wall Street ’ s latest New Year forecasts together . The market has really been wild lately . One minute everyone is celebrating Nvidia ’ s earnings thinking tech stocks can keep rising for another ten years and the next minute the market suddenly tanks and big players dump Nvidia to rotate into Google . The AI ​​boom has clearly entered its second half . So the question is how long can this wave last After this round of Christmas gains will next year keep taking off or fall flat Every year end those suitandtie Wall Street elites start brainstorming and draw a road map for the next year . This year I looked through everything almost all of them are bullish . Eternal bull market . The most optimistic one is Deutsche Bank . They boldly claim the SP 500 could reach 8000 points next year nearly a 20 % increase . Keep in mind the SP has already risen more than 10 % this year and they still want more . Why so optimistic It basically comes down to two words Artificial Intelligence . AI is no_longer just a tech buzzword . It has become the engine of the entire capital market . Nvidia Microsoft Google these giants are throwing insane amounts of money into AI RD . Capital expenditure is at record highs . Deutsche Bank believes AI investment and adoption will dominate market sentiment next year and could even spark a true productivity revolution . But here ’ s the problem the SP 500 is now trading at a 25x PE ratio while the historical average is just above 15 . Isn ’ t that expensive It definitely is . But Deutsche Bank insists that even if valuations don ’ t expand further they can stay high . Why Because supply and demand for stocks are extremely strong . Money is still flowing into equities corporate buybacks haven ’ t stopped and earnings expectations are rising . They even predict that in In 2026 EPS could reach $ 320 . Interestingly Morgan Stanley is also bullish targeting 7800 points yet they didn ’ t buy the Magnificent Seven . Their chief strategist Wilson thinks tech stocks might fall alongside the broader market . They prefer small caps consumer discretionary healthcare financials and industrials . Why Because they see a key signal earnings expectations are shifting from tech to other sectors and consumer spending is moving from entertainment to physical goods . This suggests the economy might be entering a new phase . More importantly Morgan Stanley is betting that the Fed will cut rates early . The logic is simple if employment weakens liquidity tightens and risk assets fall Powell won ’ t be able to hold he ’ ll have to pump liquidity back into the market . Once rates turn down the valuation ceiling opens again . HSBC Barclays and UBS all agree . HSBC even said who cares if there ’ s a bubble The dotcom bubble also rose for three to five years just get on the ride first . UBS even drew a bull scenario where the SP hits 8400 . But they also admit the market is shifting from tech dominance to broader sector participation . Capital spending is no_longer only on AI chips it ’ s spreading across more industries . From my perspective the U.S. market is still the top priority next year but we shouldn ’ t be overly optimistic because it will be Trump ’ s second year in office . You might not_know this but historically the second year of a U.S. presidential term especially midterm election years has been the weakest and most volatile for stocks . In 2018 during Trump 1.0 ’ s second year the first half was great then the market collapsed in the second half . The trade war began tech stocks plunged the VIX soared 70 % and even crypto and emerging markets crashed . And now The script looks nearly identical . Policies change every day . Tariffs can hit at any time . Even if the Supreme Court slows down tax hikes the possibility alone is enough to make manufacturers retailers and exporters lose sleep . Plus the 2026 midterm elections are coming . Both parties will go allout meaning fiscal policy may freeze again and market trust in the government will keep eroding . What ’ s worse sector divergence is even more extreme than in 2017 . In the U.S. only AI related tech stocks are supporting the market . Materials energy real estate everything else is dropping . Europe isn ’ t much better . Finance and utilities barely hold up while others slump . When only a few assets are booming and most are stagnant it signals a fragile market . If tech stocks cool off the entire market could lose momentum instantly . So next year political cycles policy risks and the pressure of converting AI hype into real profits these three mountains won ’ t disappear . Right now the market is pricing in aggressive rate cuts while also assuming a soft landing and continued earnings growth . Wanting everything at once often ends badly . In my view the script may look like this First half AI momentum and liquidity expectations may push the market higher again . Second half As midterm elections approach policy noise increases earnings get disrupted and volatility returns . Whoever holds high valuation low cash flow story stocks will be the most at risk ."

I have identified 4 major companies, those being HP, PTEN, NBR, and PDS. Did I miss any? I know there are companies like SLB, BKR, HAL that are larger and provide many services to the oil and gas industry, but they are not mainly contract drillers. Looking at HP, PTEN, NBR, and PDS, their total combined market cap is $7.1B and their combined enterprise value is $12.7B. This seema tiny compared to the size of the onshore oil and gas exploration and production industry in the US and Canada. Any thoughts about this?",

I like my girls, I mean my stocks, ugly. I don’t like to compete for the hot and sexy Instagram models types. Lack of self-esteem or just pure self-awareness? I will go for the second option. I am a lazy guy and I like going on cheap dates. Same thing goes for my stock selection. WPP is marred with a seemingly unsustainable debt, it has lost its leading position in the Ad industry to the more nimble AI-focused Publicis. The stock is down 80% over a decade, selling below its 2008 lows. Shareholders are suing the company, a fired exec has followed suit. A new tech-centric CEO had been hired with the hope of aligning the company with the structural reality of data and AI. Thousands of jobs are on the line of fire and more assets stripping may be required to trim down the debt. The stock is cheap, reasonably so. But I believe the market also is overreacting and overstretching WPP troubles. The company’s legacy, assets, and revenues prove still rank the company at the top end of its industry. WPP is still printing cash, its list of loyal clients a thing of envy by its competitors. Cindy Rose’s tech background looks like a wise choice given the company’s need for flexibility and adaptability to the market AI revenues-driven reality. Will she deliver? Only the future will tell. But given the level of negative sentiment, I deem the company worthy of a second look. They say the beauty is in the eye of the beholder, well, I prefer my stocks for their inner beauty, and care little for the outside appearance. WPP had been a market leader in the Ad world for nearly 50 years and I don’t see the company disappearing without a fight. There is still a lot of juice left in its tank, and I am confident in Cindy Rose’s ability to turn the ship around. At worst, she will probably do enough cleaning to make its balance sheet worthy of a takeover bid. I am buying “this girl” some flowers.",

I like my girls I mean my stocks ugly . I don ’ t like to compete for the hot and sexy Instagram models types . Lack of selfesteem or just pure selfawareness I will go for the second option . I am a lazy guy and I like going on cheap dates . Same thing goes for my stock selection . WPP is marred with a seemingly unsustainable debt it has lost its leading position in the Ad industry to the more nimble AIfocused Publicis . The stock is down 80 % over a decade selling below its 2008 lows . Shareholders are suing the company a fired exec has followed suit . A new techcentric CEO had been hired with the hope of aligning the company with the structural reality of data and AI . Thousands of jobs are on the line of fire and more assets stripping may be required to trim down the debt . The stock is cheap reasonably so . But I believe the market also is overreacting and overstretching WPP troubles . The company ’ s legacy assets and revenues prove still rank the company at the top end of its industry . WPP is still printing cash its list of loyal clients a thing of envy by its competitors . Cindy Rose ’ s tech background looks like a wise choice given the company ’ s need for flexibility and adaptability to the market AI revenuesdriven reality . Will she deliver Only the future will tell . But given the level of negative sentiment I deem the company worthy of a second look . They say the beauty is in the eye of the beholder well I prefer my stocks for their inner beauty and care little for the outside appearance . WPP had been a market leader in the Ad world for nearly 50 years and I don ’ t see the company disappearing without a fight . There is still a lot of juice left in its tank and I am confident in Cindy Rose ’ s ability to turn the ship around . At worst she will probably do enough cleaning to make its balance sheet worthy of a takeover bid . I am buying “ this girl ” some flowers ."

Traders are largely in wait-and-see mode ahead of the Federal Reserve’s rate decision at 2 p.m. ET, where a widely expected rate cut is already priced in. The real focus is on the tone of the Fed’s commentary, which many worry could lean more hawkish on future easing. GE Vernova shares edged higher after the company issued a strong 2026 revenue outlook, while Oracle and Broadcom earnings are due later in the day and may help set the tone for tech. Overall, this Fed meeting is shaping up to be one of the most divided in recent years, as policymakers try to strike a balance between supporting a softening labor market and avoiding any rekindling of inflation pressures.

      "selftext": "Amazon announced it will invest over $35 billion in India and create 1 million jobs by 2030. This represents a significant commitment, clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India. This move appears to have dual implications for Amazon: Positives: India's e-commerce demand continues to grow rapidly. Large scale investment could accelerate Amazon's market share and logistics advantages locally. Long term, it may become a new growth engine. Risks: The massive investment and long return cycle, coupled with India's intense competition and complex regulations, may not necessarily translate into profits. The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited. I see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty. Does this news make you more optimistic about AMZN's long term value? If you're a shareholder, would you increase your position or remain cautious?",

This represents a significant commitment clearly signaling a long term dedication to deepening its presence in India . This move appears to have dual implications for Amazon Positives Indias ecommerce demand continues to grow rapidly . Large scale investment could accelerate Amazons market share and logistics advantages locally . Long term it may become a new growth engine . Risks The massive investment and long return cycle coupled with Indias intense competition and complex regulations may not_necessarily translate into profits . The short term boost to stock prices could also be limited . I see this as a classic case of long term upside with short term uncertainty . Does this news make you more optimistic about AMZNs long term value If youre a shareholder would you increase your position or remain cautious"

Basically I’m pretty sure I can afford that much weekly but if I feel financial pressure I will get it down to 200£, but this is in the case but let’s start on 250£. I have seen many opinions that I should start with SP500 - VUAG, but on the other hand have seen people giving an idea to diversify into world for example or some small % to the gold. I have two questions; as I’m using trading212, for example if someone mentioned ticker VT is that means on my app/market(UK) VT will be exactly the same like in USA market for example? Another question what do you think what strategy on my place would be the best with % allocation and any ideas what to look for? Thank you so much!",

      "selftext": "According to Axios & other financial media, at least 5 voting FOMC members have publicly stated in recent weeks they oppose lowering rates today (December 10, 2025), if not the foreseeable future until/unless inflation decelerates: [ However, financial markets expect a -0.25% move as a near-certainty. This means on paper, Powell would have to get all 7 remaining voters on board … or not. In practice, many FOMC members will blabber about their personal preferences in media interviews, but consistently side with the chair on the official recorded vote. Why they do this is not entirely clear: the FOMC prides itself in being an independent, consensus-minded organization, but has also been criticized for excessive groupthink. Also, with Powell’s chairmanship coming to an end, it’s not clear why so many FOMC members act like they owe some kind of allegiance to him. **So the truth is FOMC decision making lies somewhere between “one person, one independent vote” and “the chair dictates all policy decisions.”** Which brings the topic of discussion to next year’s leadership transition. Trump has stated in interviews he wants nominal rates below 1% (he’s repeated this specific number multiple times) and has made lowering rates his #1 litmus test in looking for a new chair. **But financial markets are currently pricing in ”only“ -0.50 to -0.75% of cuts in 2026.** lf the rumored front-runner Kevin Hassett (or whomever else Trump nominates) succeeds Powell, couldn’t he use the same powers of the position to force rates much lower?",

This means on paper Powell would have to get all 7 remaining voters on board … or not_In practice many FOMC members will blabber about their personal preferences in media interviews but consistently side with the chair on the official recorded vote . Why they do this is not_entirely clear the FOMC prides itself in being an independent consensusminded organization but has also been criticized for excessive groupthink . Also with Powell ’ s chairmanship coming to an end it ’ s not_clear why so many FOMC members act like they owe some kind of allegiance to him . So the truth is FOMC decision making lies somewhere between “ one person one independent vote ” and “ the chair dictates all policy decisions. ” Which brings the topic of discussion to next year ’ s leadership transition . Trump has stated in interviews he wants nominal rates below 1 % he ’ s repeated this specific number multiple times and has made lowering rates his 1 litmus test in looking for a new chair . But financial markets are currently pricing in ” only “ 0.50 to 0.75 % of cuts in 2026. lf the rumored frontrunner Kevin Hassett or whomever else Trump nominates succeeds Powell couldn ’ t he use the same powers of the position to force rates much lower"

      "selftext": "Hello everyone. I kindly ask if anyone could give me their opinion on this splendid but suffering stock. I invested at the beginning of the year, so I am currently at a significant loss. I have averaged several times, bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC. At the moment, I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to: \\- hold the position \\- increase it \\- give up and take the loss. What are you doing? Looking at the company's financial statements over the last few years, I see stability and growth, so I don't understand why it has fallen almost 30% from its highs in such a short time. Please don't tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never played in that league, at least as far as the public is concerned. Many thanks in advance to everyone.",

I invested at the beginning of the year so I am currently at a significant loss . I have averaged several times bringing me to a price of around €366 per PMC . At the moment I am seriously wondering whether it makes sense to hold the position increase it give up and take the loss . What are you doing Looking at the companys financial statements over the last few years I see stability and growth so I dont understand why it has fallen almost 30 % from its highs in such a short time . Please dont tell me I should look at the PE ratio compared to the automotive sector because Ferrari has never_played in that league at least as far as the public is concerned . Many thanks in advance to everyone ."

      "title": "Global Bond Yields Hit 16-Year High on Fading Rate-Cut Bets",
      "selftext": "Global bond markets flashed a warning signal ahead of this week’s Federal Reserve meeting. Long-dated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009, suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad rate-cut cycles is actually ending. A Bloomberg index tracking long-term sovereign yields is now back at 16-year highs. Futures markets reflect that shift: expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished, Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month, and Australia is now priced for two more quarter-point increases next year. The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision. While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday, the broader message from global markets is that easing may not last as long or run as deep as previously hoped. Anyone else watching this tightening narrative re-emerge? Bond markets usually sniff out trends early, and this feels like a meaningful shift. Source: [",

Longdated government bond yields have climbed to levels last seen in 2009 suggesting traders are starting to question whether the era of broad ratecut cycles is actually ending . A Bloomberg index tracking longterm sovereign yields is now back at 16year highs . Futures markets reflect that shift expectations for additional cuts from the European Central Bank have essentially vanished Japan is seen as almost certain to hike this month and Australia is now priced for two more quarterpoint increases next year . The move comes just as the Fed prepares to announce its next decision . While most investors still expect a cut on Wednesday the broader message from global markets is that easing may not_last as long or run as deep as previously hoped . Anyone else watching this tightening narrative reemerge Bond markets usually sniff out trends early and this feels like a meaningful shift . Source"

Inside the FOMC, there’s a clear split: some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market, while others worry that easing too much could re-ignite inflation pressures. Beyond the rate decision itself, most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections, which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward. The cut looks likely, but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time. Source:",

Inside the FOMC there ’ s a clear split some members want continued cuts to protect a cooling labor market while others worry that easing too much could reignite inflation pressures . Beyond the rate decision itself most of the focus will likely be on the updated dot plot and economic projections which should give a better sense of how policymakers see the path forward . The cut looks likely but the forward guidance may be doing most of the talking this time . Source"

There is a large management fee of 1.5% I believe but it’s worth it if that’s the only way to invest in spacex, for the average retail investor at least. The fund can appear to underperform the market for most of the year but its SpaceX position gets repriced twice a year. The last repricing was last Friday and the fund was up 20%. I have a $50,000 position. Additionally, if you own at least $40,000, you get an invite to their annual investment conference in NYC where Elon musk is regularly a guest speaker. I went this year and heard him talk. Last year Gwyneth Shotwell, COO of SpaceX spoke on stage. They also give out free swag in the form of clothing/bags (made by Figgs, one of their investments) and there are concert/comedian performances for lunch and then a surprise performance for the end. This year it was Pink. Last year it was Michael Buble.",

There is a large management fee of 1.5 % I believe but it ’ s worth it if that ’ s the only way to invest in spacex for the average retail investor at least . The fund can appear to underperform the market for most of the year but its SpaceX position gets repriced twice a year . The last repricing was last Friday and the fund was up 20 % . I have a $ 50000 position . Additionally if you own at least $ 40000 you get an invite to their annual investment conference in NYC where Elon musk is regularly a guest speaker . I went this year and heard him talk . Last year Gwyneth Shotwell COO of SpaceX spoke on stage . They also give out free swag in the form of clothingbags made by Figgs one of their investments and there are concertcomedian performances for lunch and then a surprise performance for the end . This year it was Pink . Last year it was Michael Buble ."

I spotted their prospectus on moomoo and after some due diligence, it seems like this IPO could be a stock worth holding at the end of 2025. A few quick points about the IPO: \\- Financials: Over 50 years of net sales growth, strong cash flow, and nearly 10% sales growth from 2024 to 2025 \\- Industry: Healthcare supplies is a pretty mature sector, not super cyclical \\- Institutional backing: Big institutions supporting it gives some confidence in the market Things to watch out for: \\- PE exit could impact the stock price \\- Growth drivers in this sector aren’t exactly high-flying Seems like it could suit someone looking for a relatively stable company with solid cash flow. Anyone else looking at this one? Haven’t seen much chatter about it. Curious if others are following this IPO too.",

Long story short, for the first time ever I have cash, but I have no idea what to buy There's something about having your money and self custody and not ever needing a bank account that feels amazing... And I'm looking at buying stocks- in this market feels fake Anything with a PE ratio above 10 is mathematically a meme coin - essentially when you buy stocks with PE ratios like that most of your money is going towards a narrative not the actual company itself And I want to buy index funds - but most of them are carried by the seven biggest tech companies All the stocks seem fake The dollar seems fake And Bitcoin is about to enter a death spiral and has multiple check engine lights outside of its price that people are not aware of because most people don't know how Bitcoin works....

Long story short for the first time ever I have cash but I have no_idea what to buy Theres something about having your money and self custody and not_ever needing a bank account that feels amazing ... And Im looking at buying stocks in this market feels fake Anything with a PE ratio above 10 is mathematically a meme coin essentially when you buy stocks with PE ratios like that most of your money is going towards a narrative not_the actual company itself And I want to buy index funds but most of them are carried by the seven biggest tech companies All the stocks seem fake The dollar seems fake And Bitcoin is about to enter a death spiral and has multiple check engine lights outside of its price that people are not_aware of because most people dont know how Bitcoin works .... I have no_idea what to do with my money ....."

I’m trying to understand what the market is pricing in for the next 12–36 months. Context I remember: • OKTA fell hard from prior highs to the 70s/60s in 2022. • Security-related headlines + weak/incomplete messaging seemed to wreck confidence. • Auth0 (~$6.5B) was widely viewed as an overpay and the synergy story felt slow. The pattern: 1. OKTA reports 2. Beats estimates 3. Stock pops 4. Then fades under $100 5. Drifts back into the 80s Feels like a trust/narrative discount more than just fundamentals. My key questions: • What’s the real bear case today? • Is Microsoft bundle risk the main overhang? • Is Auth0 still a drag or turning into an asset? • Why do CRWD/Zscaler get premium multiples while OKTA can’t hold $100+? • What would trigger a durable re-rate to $120–$150+?",

      "selftext": "[ Morningstar has updated their coverage on Nvidia Corp, after he company received a significant policy win after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that the company will be permitted to resume selling its H200 AI accelerators, a roughly two-year-old generation of AI GPUs into the Chinese market. Although the U.S. government will impose a 25% revenue cut on Nvidia’s China H200 sales, higher than the previously discussed 15%, Morningstar sees this as an important step toward rebuilding Nvidia’s China AI business. Morningstar emphasizes that this development helps establish a clearer path for future revenue growth from China, a market that contributed meaningfully to Nvidia’s data-center GPU sales prior to U.S. export restrictions. However, the firm cautions that policy uncertainty remains high, and future reversals or additional restrictions cannot be ruled out. At the same time, Morningstar notes that China’s government has recently encouraged domestic AI developers to shift away from Nvidia components in favor of local alternatives. As a result, the H200’s adoption in China is not guaranteed, despite its superior performance compared with the lower-end H20 model previously approved for sale. Still, Trump’s statement that President Xi “responded positively” suggests that some level of cooperation may help Nvidia regain traction in the region. Despite the geopolitical back-and-forth, Morningstar is maintaining its $240 fair value estimate for wide-moat Nvidia, arguing that the shares remain undervalued relative to long-term fundamentals. Morningstar sees the recent selloff in AI-driven stocks as a buying opportunity for investors who can tolerate volatility. The research firm continues to assign certain aspects in the sector with uncertainty, reflecting the numerous variables influencing the company’s future, such ad U.S.-China policy tensions, global AI chip demand, competitive dynamics, and technological progress in large language models and hyperscale infrastructure. Morningstar specifically highlights the strength of Google’s Gemini AI model, which leverages Google’s in-house silicon, as a competitive risk that could affect Nvidia’s dominance in AI accelerators over time. Overall, Morningstar views the U.S. approval for H200 China sales as a positive but measured step for Nvidia, acknowledging both the revenue upside and the geopolitical risks that continue to shape the firm’s long-term outlook.",

      "selftext": "Lately, the U.S. government has shown signs of easing restrictions on exporting high end AI chips to China. According to multiple media reports, the Trump administration has decided to allow NVDA to export its H200 chips to China, but under the condition that 25% of the revenue is taken as a fee. From a market perspective, if the H200 can legally be sold in China, it could be a major step for NVDA to regain access to the world’s largest AI market ， especially since export restrictions had previously caused its market share in China to drop to almost zero. And compared to the earlier H20 chip sold to China, the H200 is a big upgrade. However, even though it’s been approved, there are still a lot of uncertainties ，whether China will allow large scale purchases, whether there will be additional reviews, and whether concerns over security and domestic technology independence will lead to procurement limits. There are even reports suggesting that China may impose extra procedures or restrictions on H200 purchases. I believe global AI demand is still booming and NVDA long term fundamentals remain strong. But with China rapidly pushing for its own AI chip development, will the H200 still be welcomed by the market there? And could this be a good setup opportunity for NVDA and other U.S. chip stocks?",

      "selftext": "There's been a lot of talk lately about the Fed potentially cutting rates, but with the way things are going, I’m not so sure we’ll see that anytime soon. The economy’s holding up, but tech stocks, especially the high-valuation ones, are facing some serious pressure One big factor is the rise in job openings. More job vacancies are pushing up labor costs, which could hit companies that rely on high-paid talent the hardest. This is a problem for tech stocks, especially in a higher-rate environment where margins are already getting squeezed The other issue is wage inflation. When there’s a shortage of workers, businesses have to pay more to attract and keep talent, which can lead to rising prices across the board. And if that happens, inflation could start ticking up again. If job vacancies keep climbing, the Fed might have no choice but to delay rate cuts or even keep tightening until inflation is under control. It’s clear that they’re focused on inflation, and strong demand in the labor market is a big concern for them. So, I m curious how are you all thinking about this? Are you still bullish on tech, or are you adjusting your strategy given the pressure from higher labor costs and the Fed’s stance?",

      "selftext": "Hey 25M here. In 2024 i finished university and started, I started working as a mechanical engineer. With that i began investing and learning all about it this year. I opted for VUAA. I do roughly €200 a month, i recently did a large sump investment too. I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT. Thats my main investments into the future. I am planning to keep around €6-7k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4% inflation. I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.8-1.3% and they also have investment savings account. But with fees that amounts to about 2.7% and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum. There are various other fees they also do. This doesn't seem viable for me. Also government bonds aren't available/worth it. I am learning and looking into MMFs, bond ETFs etc. People have recommended XEON, which gives around 2.3%. I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs. For example ERNX. Which is about 2.6% However, i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4% and attempt to cover inflation. I don't mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up. Open to all suggestions. I am based in Europe, Slovakia.",

I opted for VUAA . I do roughly €200 a month i recently did a large sump investment too . I am also looking into doing a small percentage into SXRT . Thats my main investments into the future . I am planning to keep around €67k as emergency fund in my bank and i have about another €7k I want to put into some sort of fund to at least cover 4 % inflation . I looked into my bank and a normal savings account has 0.81.3 % and they also have investment savings account . But with fees that amounts to about 2.7 % and i cant touch the money for 12 months minimum . There are various other fees they also do . This doesnt seem viable for me . Also government bonds arent availableworth it . I am learning and looking into MMFs bond ETFs etc . People have recommended XEON which gives around 2.3 % . I am also looking to varioud Bond ETFs . For example ERNX . Which is about 2.6 % However i am looking for recommendations from people on what I could possibly do to get around 4 % and attempt to cover inflation . I dont mind learning and managing various things or doing something more complicated to set it up . Open to all suggestions . I am based in Europe Slovakia ."

      "title": "Figure Technologies is positioned to pioneer the modernization of traditional finance infrastructure with a bridge to digital assets",
      "selftext": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets (i.e. lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks, clearinghouses, and brokers collecting rent on each transaction). The company IPO'd earlier this year at $25 per share behind their mortgage / HELOC platform, which promises “a better mortgage done on blockchain”. A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $730 and takes a median of 10 days to close, compared to industry avg mortgage costs $11.2K and 42 days to close. Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days, and its platform automates 89% of loans from application through underwriting (i.e. borrower doesn’t need to talk to a human). Figure facilitated $6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months, up 29% from the prior year. For comparison, I am seeing JPM Chase originated \\~$38.2 billion and BoA originated \\~$29 billion, while leaders United Wholesale originated \\~$140 Billion in loans in 2024, and Rocket Mortgage \\~$100 Billion (publicly available sources). The point here is FIGR has some traction, but are not main-stream yet. Figure sees an $80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace - based on $2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4% take rate. **Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential** If FIGR’s process works as well as they say it does, which so far it seems to, it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital. Figure’s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paper-driven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana (added to S&P 500 this month) did for the secondary auto market. If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer, you know what I'm talking about. FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC’s, but are positioned to bring tokenized real-world assets and securities to the main stream. And unlike Carvana, FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention (i.e. it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans) – as of 9/30/2025 FIGR’s balance sheet shows $389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations. **FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company** Highlights include 42% YoY revenue growth, 82% gross margin, and $2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter +70% YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY. FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities, up from 168 in the S1 (as of 6/30/2025). The company also announced a first-of-its-kind the launch of a blockchain-native equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares. This has never been done before. **Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize** I am generally bullish on blockchain, stablecoins, and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70’s, and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process (deeds and “wet ink” requirements). Today's regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here. Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes (i.e. they are unnecessarily complex and expensive). These processes are begging to be disrupted. Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration, so if blockchain is going to work, we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed. **Conclusion** Figure, under Mike Cagney’s and Michael Tannenbaum’s leadership, are positioned well to be one of the [MAG 7]( to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing real-world assets and securities as well as stablecoin. If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US, FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen. Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets / blockchain! Not Investment Advice. All opinions are my own. I am long FIGR.",

      "selftext_processed": "Figure Technologies mission is to build the future of capital markets using its L1 Provenance Blockchain and believes it can remove intermediaries to achieve pareto markets i.e . lenders and borrowers are connected directly via blockchain without banks clearinghouses and brokers collecting rent on each transaction . The company IPOd earlier this year at $ 25 per share behind their mortgage HELOC platform which promises “ a better mortgage done on blockchain ” . A mortgage done with Figure costs an avg of $ 730 and takes a median of 10 days to close compared to industry avg mortgage costs $ 11.2K and 42 days to close . Figure can offer HELOC approvals in as little as five minutes and funding in as few as five days and its platform automates 89 % of loans from application through underwriting i.e . borrower doesn ’ t need to talk to a human . Figure facilitated $ 6 billion of home equity lending on its platform in the past 12 months up 29 % from the prior year . For comparison I am seeing JPM Chase originated $ 38.2 billion and BoA originated $ 29 billion while leaders United Wholesale originated $ 140 Billion in loans in 2024 and Rocket Mortgage $ 100 Billion publicly available sources . The point here is FIGR has some traction but are not_mainstream yet . Figure sees an $ 80 billion revenue opportunity for its Loan Origination and Distribution marketplace based on $ 2 trillion of annual consumer loan origination estimate and 4 % take rate . Carvana analogy illustrates FIGR potential If FIGR ’ s process works as well as they say it does which so far it seems to it is an unbelievably better and more accessible experience for every consumer – especially as people become increasingly more digital . Figure ’ s platform creates process efficiencies to digitize and automate the manual and paperdriven mortgage and lending process in a similar way to what Carvana added to SP 500 this month did for the secondary auto market . If anyone has sold a used car on through Carvana vs a dealer you know what Im talking about . FIGR started with mortgages and HELOC ’ s but are positioned to bring tokenized realworld assets and securities to the main stream . And unlike Carvana FIGR maintains a capital light business model that decouples loan origination from balance sheet retention i.e . it offers mortgage and HELOC loans and a marketplace to transact those securitized loans – as of 9302025 FIGR ’ s balance sheet shows $ 389 million in loans held for sale and facilitated $ 2.4 billion in quarterly HELOC originations . FIGR had an excellent first earnings call as a public company Highlights include 42 % YoY revenue growth 82 % gross margin and $ 2.5 billion in loan volume for the quarter 70 % YoY and the company reported that HELOC lending volumes tripled YoY . FIGR also expanded its partner network to 246 entities up from 168 in the S1 as of 6302025 . The company also announced a firstofitskind the launch of a blockchainnative equity share class on the Provenance blockchain – basically an ICO for real equity shares . This has never_been done before . Traditional finance in the US needs blockchain to modernize I am generally bullish on blockchain stablecoins and tokenized RWA becoming a part of traditional finance because it is unbelievable that in the US we operate on a payments and securities trading infrastructure that was built in the 70 ’ s and we still use physical paper throughout the mortgage and lending process deeds and “ wet ink ” requirements . Todays regulatory environment makes now a great time to make progress here . Interchange fees are way too high and there are probably far too many intermediaries in traditional finance processes i.e . they are unnecessarily complex and expensive . These processes are begging to be disrupted . Traditional finance has also been granted the greatest regulatory tailwinds in history through the current white house administration so if blockchain is going to work we should see some of the biggest progress as regulation and rules of the game are developed . Conclusion Figure under Mike Cagney ’ s and Michael Tannenbaum ’ s leadership are positioned well to be one of the MAG 7 to bridge the gap between digital assets and traditional finance through both tokenizing realworld assets and securities as well as stablecoin . If you believe that Blockchain technology can upgrade capital markets and payments infrastructure in the US FIGR seems to be positioned as one of the first to make this happen . Curious if anyone else has thoughts about FIGR or other plays bridging traditional finance and digital assets blockchain Not_Investment Advice . All opinions are my own . I am long FIGR ."

      "title": "Trying To Understand Where Nvidia Really Stands As AI Demand Rises",
      "selftext": "Nvidia’s recent moves keep pulling me back into the conversation because every new detail seems to reshape the picture a little. The approval to sell H200 chips to China is one of those changes that feels bigger than the headlines make it. It unlocks a huge AI market again, even though the regulatory environment around them is tightening. The stock reacting with a 2% premarket jump shows how strongly investors still believe in the long term story. Their profitability numbers back that confidence. A gross margin of 70.05% and an operating margin of 58.84% tell me Nvidia still has the kind of breathing room most companies don’t get. Even the valuation is shifting in an interesting way. The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before, especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth. The insider sales are the part I’m still trying to understand. Sixteen sales in total worth around $12.26M and not a single acquisition or award in that window. The CFO alone handled 25% of the total value, and one of her sales was more than 3% times her usual size. It could be perfect timing, it could be strategic, or it could just be routine for management. But the pattern stands out, and I can’t ignore it. Analysts don’t seem worried at all. Most targets range from $220 to $320 while the stock trades around $185.55. Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $300 with a high accuracy record, Bernstein at $275, and Melius goes all the way to $320. Even online discussions around rising volume show traders expecting something to build again while other uex like bitget are still pushing their users to trade more of it to keep securing their leading uex in tokenized choice for US stock trading in the space. Still, we have John Chambers saying 2026 will be a strong year for AI which adds another layer of expectation. My question is simple. Is Nvidia setting up for its next major run or are these insider moves a quiet signal that the current price already reflects a lot of the future.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia ’ s recent moves keep pulling me back into the conversation because every new detail seems to reshape the picture a little . The approval to sell H200 chips to China is one of those changes that feels bigger than the headlines make it . It unlocks a huge AI market again even though the regulatory environment around them is tightening . The stock reacting with a 2 % premarket jump shows how strongly investors still believe in the long term story . Their profitability numbers back that confidence . A gross margin of 70.05 % and an operating margin of 58.84 % tell me Nvidia still has the kind of breathing room most companies don ’ t get . Even the valuation is shifting in an interesting way . The P E ratio sliding from 48.89x to 45.63x and EV EBITDA moving from 41.39x to 38.29x makes it look less stretched than before especially for a company sitting at the center of AI growth . The insider sales are the part I ’ m still trying to understand . Sixteen sales in total worth around $ 12.26M and not_a single acquisition or award in that window . The CFO alone handled 25 % of the total value and one of her sales was more than 3 % times her usual size . It could be perfect timing it could be strategic or it could just be routine for management . But the pattern stands out and I can ’ t ignore it . Analysts don ’ t seem worried at all . Most targets range from $ 220 to $ 320 while the stock trades around $ 185.55 . Cantor Fitzgerald sits at $ 300 with a high accuracy record Bernstein at $ 275 and Melius goes all the way to $ 320 . Even online discussions around rising volume show traders expecting something to build again while other uex like bitget are still pushing their users to trade more of it to keep securing their leading uex in tokenized choice for US stock trading in the space . Still we have John Chambers saying 2026 will be a strong year for AI which adds another layer of expectation . My question is simple . Is Nvidia setting up for its next major run or are these insider moves a quiet signal that the current price already reflects a lot of the future ."

I set a target, lock funds, and on settlement I either buy/sell at that price or just get my assets back with some yield. It’s not magic - the funds are locked, and sometimes nothing happens if the market doesn’t hit my target but it does take the stress out of timing the market.

      "selftext": "Anyone else feel like we’re walking into a weird Fed meeting this time? Everyone keeps calling it a “hawkish cut” setup which honestly sounds like an oxymoron but New York banks are basically telegraphing the same thing: “Yes, we’ll cut… but don’t get excited.” And that’s exactly the kind of messaging that usually whips the market in both directions before we get any real clarity. Here’s what’s messing with my head right now: Inflation is cooling, but not in a way that gives Powell the victory lap he wants. Labor data looks soft enough for a cut, but not soft enough for a full pivot. The bond market is acting like cuts are already guaranteed, while equities are pretending they’ve already spent the money. If we do get a hawkish cut, I’m honestly not sure which side reacts harder tech has been running on fumes, defensives are asleep, and small caps are out here fighting for their lives. My gut? Powell cuts 25bps, sounds like a disappointed dad, and the first move is the wrong move. Every FOMC lately has been a fade the initial-reaction trade. What I’m watching: Whether Powell mentions “financial conditions” tightening big clue. How the dot plot shifts for 2025 (this will decide who bleeds). If he pushes back on “multiple cuts” expectations that’s where the fireworks start. I’ve traded through a lot of these, but something about this one feels like the market is too sure of the outcome. Whenever that happens, the Fed usually smacks someone. Curious what’s everyone positioning into this? Are you hedging? Sitting in cash? Leaning into the volatility? Or just grabbing popcorn and letting algos fight it out?",

Here ’ s what ’ s messing with my head right now Inflation is cooling but not_in a way that gives Powell the victory lap he wants . Labor data looks soft enough for a cut but not_soft enough for a full pivot . The bond market is acting like cuts are already guaranteed while equities are pretending they ’ ve already spent the money . If we do get a hawkish cut I ’ m honestly not_sure which side reacts harder tech has been running on fumes defensives are asleep and small caps are out here fighting for their lives . My gut Powell cuts 25bps sounds like a disappointed dad and the first move is the wrong move . Every FOMC lately has been a fade the initialreaction trade . What I ’ m watching Whether Powell mentions “ financial conditions ” tightening big clue . How the dot plot shifts for 2025 this will decide who bleeds . If he pushes back on “ multiple cuts ” expectations that ’ s where the fireworks start . I ’ ve traded through a lot of these but something about this one feels like the market is too sure of the outcome . Whenever that happens the Fed usually smacks someone . Curious what ’ s everyone positioning into this Are you hedging Sitting in cash Leaning into the volatility Or just grabbing popcorn and letting algos fight it out"

      "selftext": "Kind of funny… the market feels like it just took a deep breath today. The Dow crawling up a bit, the S&P drifting higher, the Nasdaq finally turning green right before the Fed speaks. It has the same quiet “oh, we’re doing this now?” reversal energy that popped up back in November. And on the crypto side, it wouldn’t be surprising if a similar shift is bubbling under the surface. Events like bitget phase 2 of the Crazy 48H rush tend to spark quick rotations, while phase 3’s BGB focus might end up pulling more long-view traders in. When a token or stock holds up well during a choppy period, people naturally start treating it as a potential anchor while everything else tries to find direction. Then you add the macro mix… JOLTS showing job openings ticking up, Nvidia getting the go-ahead on China chip exports, markets warming up a little. It all adds up to one of those stretches where both stocks and crypto start hinting at a run even before the headlines catch up. Feels like an interesting setup heading into year-end.",

And on the crypto side it wouldn ’ t be surprising if a similar shift is bubbling under the surface . Events like bitget phase 2 of the Crazy 48H rush tend to spark quick rotations while phase 3 ’ s BGB focus might end up pulling more longview traders in . When a token or stock holds up well during a choppy period people naturally start treating it as a potential anchor while everything else tries to find direction . Then you add the macro mix… JOLTS showing job openings ticking up Nvidia getting the goahead on China chip exports markets warming up a little . It all adds up to one of those stretches where both stocks and crypto start hinting at a run even before the headlines catch up . Feels like an interesting setup heading into yearend ."

      "selftext": "Hey, so if you don't know, I post more a lot in the daily threads over at r/stocks. I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past. One was around what I have learned along the years of investing, with like how I screen and how I research things. My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet, where I'm a GARPy style investor. I don't mind paying fair price for something, like Buffet would say \"**It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price, than a fair company at a wonderful price\".** So when I screen, I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues. More than happy to share my screener as well. I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research. I actually enjoy doing this, since this can basically be a free hobby. You get to learn more about the world around you, plus just different industries. I also feel like this is one area you can do well, is finding some under the radar names that have little no analyst coverage. Below are some stocks I just find interesting, Doesn't mean you should go out and buy these names, but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion. So here are those companies: **BK Technologies Corp** [ Smaller company, but fundamentals are pretty solid. I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership. This company fits that, with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13% insider ownership. Also has like no debt. Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not being that great, but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong. [ Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios. They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them. Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory, better margins and improved their working capital. Latest investor presentation: [ **Synchrony Financial** [ Much larger market cap here, with this one being 28B. Overall, it's a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8, with a PEG at 0.56. This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers, making them more of a niche play. This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names, but just offers a really cheap valuation. Latest quarter presentation: [ **Brainsway Ltd - ADR** This one is way more speculative of a name and not cheap, but the PEG is still about 1.04, since the EPS growth has been great. [ ROIC is a bit lower, but the company is what new to being profitable, but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023. It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters, around 27% growth QoQ. Another name is little debt, around 6.75M, but has 70M in cash & cash equivalents. Overall, I just find this company really interesting, what they do almost sounds fake. It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders, anxious depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, smoking addiction, bipolar disorders, post traumatic stress disorders, schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s disease, autism, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, post stroke rehabilitation, and Parkinson’s diseases. This is all FDA approved as well. Their latest investor presentation: [ **Flotek Industries Inc** Just opened a position in them this morning. They've been on my screener for a bit, but never looked into them. I tend to stay away from oil & gas names, really just own like one name in the space, FTI (which is another fun company) Valuation isn't too bad by any means: [ What is wild about this company, is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things. Kind's of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth. Gross margins went from like 18.3% in Sep 2024 to 31.7% Sept 2025. Same thing happened with operating margins, going from 5.5% to 16.5% that same time period. ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive. [",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey so if you dont know I post more a lot in the daily threads over at rstocks . I do like to write from time to time and have written a few posts in the past . One was around what I have learned along the years of investing with like how I screen and how I research things . My approach is kind of a blend of Lynch and Buffet where Im a GARPy style investor . I dont mind paying fair price for something like Buffet would say Its far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price . So when I screen I like to look for companies with a PEG under 2 and have high ROIC with growing revenues . More than happy to share my screener as well . I think a big part of becoming a successful investor is having to research . I actually enjoy doing this since this can basically be a free hobby . You get to learn more about the world around you plus just different industries . I also feel like this is one area you can do well is finding some under the radar names that have little no_analyst coverage . Below are some stocks I just find interesting Doesnt mean you should go out and buy these names but rather just highlighting some companies you probably have never_heard of and just to bring up for the sake of discussion . So here are those companies BK Technologies Corp Smaller company but fundamentals are pretty solid . I have a thing for small float companies with good or high insider ownership . This company fits that with only 2.97M shares available on the float with 13 % insider ownership . Also has like no_debt . Really strong numbers the last 4 quarters with revenue growth not_being that great but with gross margins and operating margins really improving as well as ROIC is looking really strong . Basically the company makes two way land mobile radios . They basically sell to all the federal agencies and have strong connections with them . Part of the story is the company outsourcing manufacturing which has led them to have less inventory better margins and improved their working capital . Latest investor presentation Synchrony Financial Much larger market cap here with this one being 28B . Overall its a pretty cheap valuation for the company with the forward and trailing PE both at 8 with a PEG at 0.56 . This company basically does financing and branded credit cards for retailers making them more of a niche play . This one is a basically really boring compounder that has the risks of all credit names but just offers a really cheap valuation . Latest quarter presentation Brainsway Ltd ADR This one is way more speculative of a name and not_cheap but the PEG is still about 1.04 since the EPS growth has been great . ROIC is a bit lower but the company is what new to being profitable but still seeing double digits revenue growth since Sep 2023 . It has been a bit more normalized the past four quarters around 27 % growth QoQ . Another name is little debt around 6.75M but has 70M in cash cash equivalents . Overall I just find this company really interesting what they do almost sounds fake . It offers Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation platform technology for the treatment of major depressive disorders anxious depression obsessivecompulsive disorders smoking addiction bipolar disorders post traumatic stress disorders schizophrenia Alzheimer ’ s disease autism chronic pain multiple sclerosis post stroke rehabilitation and Parkinson ’ s diseases . This is all FDA approved as well . Their latest investor presentation Flotek Industries Inc Just opened a position in them this morning . Theyve been on my screener for a bit but never_looked into them . I tend to stay away from oil gas names really just own like one name in the space FTI which is another fun company Valuation isnt too bad by any means What is wild about this company is the explosive growth they are seeing because they are basically going all into their data analytics side of things . Kinds of wild how much this has changed up the companies growth . Gross margins went from like 18.3 % in Sep 2024 to 31.7 % Sept 2025 . Same thing happened with operating margins going from 5.5 % to 16.5 % that same time period . ROIC is also looking great and the EPS growth is really impressive ."

      "title": "RBLX (Roblox): A Leader in the Future of Virtual Worlds",
      "selftext": "I've been following Roblox (RBLX Corporation) stock recently, and I think it's a great investment opportunity. As a gaming platform, Roblox has attracted a large number of young users, especially teenagers and children; almost every kid knows it. More importantly, it's not just a game platform; it's a platform for creation and social interaction, where players can create their own games and interact with other players. This unique model makes Roblox a huge ecosystem, not just a simple entertainment platform. With its growing user base, Roblox's revenue model is also expanding, from virtual item sales to advertising and revenue sharing with game developers, all providing the company with stable income streams. Although Roblox is currently still operating at a loss, its revenue growth rate is very fast, and I believe that as user engagement increases, the losses will gradually decrease, eventually leading to profitability. What makes me even more optimistic is that with the rise of virtual reality and the metaverse concept, Roblox, as an open virtual world platform, is in a very advantageous position. In the future, the demand for virtual worlds will only increase, and Roblox itself has the capability to build such virtual worlds. For young people, Roblox is not just a gaming platform, but also a virtual social space, and I believe this trend will continue. Even more interestingly, many may not have noticed Roblox's very strong creator economy. More and more users are not only playing games, but also creating games and earning money through the platform. This \"player-creator\" model not only provides Roblox with more content, but also greatly enhances user engagement and stickiness. For me, Roblox represents far more than just a gaming platform; it's more like a promising virtual world that I believe will become a crucial part of global entertainment and social interaction in the coming years. Overall, despite the current stock price volatility, I believe in Roblox's long-term growth potential, especially its breakthroughs in the youth market and virtual reality, making it a stock worth holding for the long term. And looking at its chart, the overall structure is also in an upward trend. What do you think?",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been following Roblox RBLX Corporation stock recently and I think its a great investment opportunity . As a gaming platform Roblox has attracted a large number of young users especially teenagers and children almost every kid knows it . More importantly its not_just a game platform its a platform for creation and social interaction where players can create their own games and interact with other players . This unique model makes Roblox a huge ecosystem not_just a simple entertainment platform . With its growing user base Robloxs revenue model is also expanding from virtual item sales to advertising and revenue sharing with game developers all providing the company with stable income streams . Although Roblox is currently still operating at a loss its revenue growth rate is very fast and I believe that as user engagement increases the losses will gradually decrease eventually leading to profitability . What makes me even more optimistic is that with the rise of virtual reality and the metaverse concept Roblox as an open virtual world platform is in a very advantageous position . In the future the demand for virtual worlds will only increase and Roblox itself has the capability to build such virtual worlds . For young people Roblox is not_just a gaming platform but also a virtual social space and I believe this trend will continue . Even more interestingly many may not_have noticed Robloxs very strong creator economy . More and more users are not_only playing games but also creating games and earning money through the platform . This playercreator model not_only provides Roblox with more content but also greatly enhances user engagement and stickiness . For me Roblox represents far more than just a gaming platform its more like a promising virtual world that I believe will become a crucial part of global entertainment and social interaction in the coming years . Overall despite the current stock price volatility I believe in Robloxs longterm growth potential especially its breakthroughs in the youth market and virtual reality making it a stock worth holding for the long term . And looking at its chart the overall structure is also in an upward trend . What do you think"

Even the founder of Anthropic went to meet with India’s top officials recently. The whole vibe feels… different. To me, this news isn’t about “bullish” or “bearish.” It’s more like a reminder: the big players are already positioning themselves for what the world looks like ten years from now, while most of us are still glued to short-term charts. Do you think Microsoft is just following its usual global expansion playbook? Or is this something bigger?",

The whole vibe feels… different . To me this news isn ’ t about “ bullish ” or “ bearish. ” It ’ s more like a reminder the big players are already positioning themselves for what the world looks like ten years from now while most of us are still glued to shortterm charts .

      "selftext": "[ Dec 9 (Reuters) - Beijing is set to limit access to Nvidia's advanced H200 chips despite U.S. President Donald Trump's [decision]( to allow the export of the technology to China, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. Regulators in Beijing have been discussing ways to permit limited access to the H200, Nvidia's second-best generation of artificial intelligence chips, according to the report. Such a move would add a hurdle to Nvidia [(NVDA.O)]( [, opens new tab]( and other top U.S. chipmakers' ability to address the China market, after Trump's Monday announcement appeared to settle a debate over whether these companies should keep their global lead by selling AI chips to China or withhold shipments. Nvidia shares, which had risen as much as 2% in premarket trading, pared gains after the report and were last up about 0.6%. The company did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the report. Beijing has been [pushing back]( against domestic firms' use of U.S. technology, especially Nvidia chips, as it retaliates against American restrictions. Earlier U.S. restrictions banned the sale of advanced AI processors to China, weighing on Nvidia's ability to grow in one of the world's largest markets for AI chips and development. The export of the [H200 chips]( will be permitted with a 25% fee levied on such sales, Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Monday. Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, said the approval alone may have limited impact on Nvidia's business in China unless it is allowed to export other chip lines such as Blackwell or Rubin. Shares of AMD and Intel also pared gains and were last up about 0.3% in premarket trading. So far this year, Nvidia has gained nearly 40% compared with the S&P 500 [(.SPX)]( [, opens new tab]( benchmark index's 16.4% rise in the same period.",

Thinking of either: (a) 60% VOO, 20% QQQM, 20% VXUS or (b) 45% VOO, 35% QQQM, 20% VXUS. After considering the various factors, my reasons for these 3 ETFs are as follows: - VOO as the backbone with the S&P 500. Although it’s the default “VOO and chill” which is a little boring, it’s relatively reliable and stable as a compounder and captures the overall strength of the US economy. - QQQM as the turbocharger for growth. Yes, VOO already has tech, but I see QQQM as a deliberate overweight into the sector which beats the broad market over the long run. I’m still on the boat that the tech sector will continue to thrive exponentially. - VXUS to capture everything non-US related. Europe, Japan, emerging markets, developed Asia. When the dollar weakens, when US valuations get too hot, when global cycles differ, VXUS is my ballast and the global hedge so I can ensure that I’m not betting my entire future on just one country.",

      "selftext": "Honestly, I’m getting tired of looking for value in this market with everything at ATH, so I started digging into unloved sectors. Stumbled across NICE Ltd ($NICE) and the numbers are weirdly good for a stock that’s done nothing lately. Basically, they do the backend software for contact centers (CCaaS) and financial crime prevention. Not sexy, I know. But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money. Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business. Usually, when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition, the multiple expands, but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pure-play cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow. I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings: |Metric|The Numbers|Why I think it matters| |:-|:-|:-| |**Cloud Growth**|**\\~20-22% (Guidance)**|Finally offsetting the legacy churn| |**FinCrime Margin**|**60-62%**|High-margin \"floor\" that funds the AI transition| |**Cash on Hand**|**\\~$1.5B**|Huge safety net, no bankruptcy risk here| |**Valuation**|**Discounted**|Priced like hardware, growing like SaaS| I looked deeper at their \"Actimize\" segment (the high-margin anti-money laundering stuff), and that 60%+ margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can’t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators. The bear case is obviously Amazon. Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors, NICE could get squeezed. Also, they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend, and integration is always a coin toss. I’m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it’s \"boring\" compared to AI chips. Does anyone here have experience with their actual product? Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed?",

Basically they do the backend software for contact centers CCaaS and financial crime prevention . Not_sexy I know . But here is the thing – they are quietly pivoting to cloud and actually making money . Their cloud revenue is growing fast and is about to flip their legacy business . Usually when legacy tech companies pull off a cloud transition the multiple expands but NICE is still trading at a massive discount to pureplay cloud stocks like Salesforce or ServiceNow . I pulled the key numbers that stood out to me from their latest filings MetricThe NumbersWhy I think it matters Cloud Growth2022 % GuidanceFinally offsetting the legacy churn FinCrime Margin6062 % Highmargin floor that funds the AI transition Cash on Hand $ 1.5BHuge safety net no_bankruptcy risk here ValuationDiscountedPriced like hardware growing like SaaS I looked deeper at their Actimize segment the highmargin antimoney laundering stuff and that 60 % margin feels like a sticky floor because banks can ’ t just stop spending on compliance without getting fined by regulators . The bear case is obviously Amazon . Amazon Connect is eating market share and if AWS decides to burn cash to kill competitors NICE could get squeezed . Also they just bought Cognigy to catch up on the AI agent trend and integration is always a coin toss . I ’ m thinking of opening a position because it feels like a classic GARP play that the market is ignoring because it ’ s boring compared to AI chips . Does anyone here have experience with their actual product Is the moat against Amazon real or are they going to get crushed"

      "selftext": "There's a video on Youtube titled 'What does 'wealthy' even mean in 2025?' which is a CNN channel. Here, CNN's Michael Smerconish speaks with Jean Chatzky. Mrs. Chatzky claims (time stamp 5:56 of the video) that a wealth transfer of $124T will happen from Boomers to their kids or whatever. Another thing she says is that this will increase the wealth concentration as in the rich will become even richer, and there will be fewer of those. It immediately hit me. Where will they plough that money into? A good chunk h_as to end up in S&P500 right? In other words, in the next decade, as and when these boomers pass on, S&P500 (and hence, the mag-7) should skyrocket in price right? Added to that, if these guys manage to pull it off in the AI race, these stocks are bound to skyrocket in price and could be at an inflated level (meaning high pe etc) for a while right? These two forces (AI boom, and wealth transfer of 124 freakin trillion dollars) should propel the markets a lot I'd think. It's basically an economic stimulus right? But this time, the fed is not printing the money. Your thoughts?",

      "title": "Google, Warby Parker to launch Gemini AI-powered smart glasses in 2026",
      "selftext": "Source: Dec 8 (Reuters) - Warby Parker said on Monday it is collaborating with Alphabet's Google to develop lightweight AI-powered glasses, with the first product expected to launch in 2026. The announcement, made during The Android Show | XR Edition, marks the first time the companies have set a public timeline for the release since unveiling the partnership earlier this year. Google has been making a renewed push into augmented reality and wearable technology, a sector where Meta and Apple have taken early leads. Meta has poured resources into its Quest mixed-reality headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses, while Apple entered the market with its Vision Pro headset earlier this year, positioning it as a premium spatial computing device. Google, which shelved its consumer-focused Glass product nearly a decade ago, is now betting on AI integration and strategic partnerships to make smart eyewear more mainstream. The collaboration with Warby Parker will leverage Google's Android XR platform and Gemini AI model to deliver multimodal intelligence in everyday eyewear, aiming for suitable for all-day wear. Warby Parker described its upcoming glasses as \"lightweight and AI-enabled\" but did not provide details on pricing or distribution plans. In a blog post, Google said it is working with Samsung, Gentle Monster and Warby Parker to create stylish, lightweight glasses. The initiative includes two types of devices: AI glasses for screen-free assistance, equipped with speakers, microphones and cameras for natural interaction with Gemini, and display AI glasses that feature an in-lens display for private access to information such as navigation or translation captions.",

The GENIUS Act regulatory changes permit the withdrawal of limits previously imposed by the staff advisory committee.

      "selftext": "What forms of damages/theft can Civil Asset Forfeiture take that I should be worried about? We have a lot of stories about Civil asset forfeiture out there already. Most of them are about cash and metals in vehicles or safe deposit boxes. Stuff that's tangible. In some cases, document folders too, because they might have a method to get more money. However, I have only seen one recent post saying that an \\*attempt\\* was made in civil asset forfeiture to take a person's entire brokerage account. I have had my brokerages for years and years and always thought it kept me immune to civil asset forfeiture, but this is something I do have to worry about since I have already been illegally detained by the police once since they didn't want me to call 911 or file complaints against a specific kind of people that attack others with a specific type of weapon. That same police department has harassed me over a year now. Has anyone actually lost all their stocks and cash in banks and brokerages to civil asset forfeiture based on a false charge brought on by police officers? Recently, they made an accusation at me of forcing entry to neighbors houses, and also, they heavily implied that I shouldn't be living there, but in the future, they could bring any number of bogus charges against me just to succeed in the forfeiture, and then they can drop the charges later once the brokerages comply, if they do.",

Most of them are about cash and metals in vehicles or safe deposit boxes . Stuff thats tangible . In some cases document folders too because they might have a method to get more money . However I have only seen one recent post saying that an attempt was made in civil asset forfeiture to take a persons entire brokerage account . I have had my brokerages for years and years and always thought it kept me immune to civil asset forfeiture but this is something I do have to worry about since I have already been illegally detained by the police once since they didnt want me to call 911 or file complaints against a specific kind of people that attack others with a specific type of weapon . That same police department has harassed me over a year now . Has anyone actually lost all their stocks and cash in banks and brokerages to civil asset forfeiture based on a false charge brought on by police officers Recently they made an accusation at me of forcing entry to neighbors houses and also they heavily implied that I shouldnt be living there but in the future they could bring any number of bogus charges against me just to succeed in the forfeiture and then they can drop the charges later once the brokerages comply if they do ."

      "selftext": "Credentials: 14 year automotive veteran. 15 year options trader Bullet Points: 1) Carvana’s profit margins are too good to be true. The best companies in the industry don’t come close to their 19% gross profit margins. 2) The CEO of Carvana (Ernest Garcia III) Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime. Drivetime is a dumpster fire. 3) Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana’s earnings. Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets. 4) Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat 5) Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year. At average $330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD. None of this reflects on the company’s financial report. Thesis: Based on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company’s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd. In the same period the company issued ~15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd. None of this issuance reflects on the company’s balance sheets. Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock. Carvana has no dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders. Drivetime (a company owned by Carvana’s CEO) has the worst inventory I have ever seen. Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage. Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months. In October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock. I am not a private investigator, financial pro, or accountant, but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana’s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge. I plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500",

The best companies in the industry don ’ t come close to their 19 % gross profit margins . 2 The CEO of Carvana Ernest Garcia III Also owns a privately owned auto business named Drivetime . Drivetime is a dumpster fire . 3 Ernest Garcia III has been funneling his unwanted Carvana inventory to Drivetime to prop up Carvana ’ s earnings . Drivetime overpays Carvana for this inventory and then takes the loss on their own balance sheets . 4 Over the last few months Ernest Garcia III has been selling tens of millions of dollars of stock to keep Drivetime afloat 5 Carvana has issued roughly 15.3 million shares over the last year . At average $ 330 price this comes to roughly 5 Billion USD . None of this reflects on the company ’ s financial report . Thesis Based on CVNA October 2025 earnings report the company ’ s equity attributed to shareholders increased by 1B usd . In the same period the company issued 15.3 million shares worth over 5B usd . None of this issuance reflects on the company ’ s balance sheets . Healthy companies issue dividends and buy back stock . Carvana has no_dividend and has issued billions in stock solely to their core insiders . Drivetime a company owned by Carvana ’ s CEO has the worst inventory I have ever seen . Thousands and thousands of cars that are absolutely overpriced garbage . Some of the cars they have been sitting on for over 6 months . In October and September of 2025 Ernest Garcia III has sold roughly 82 million dollars of carvana stock . I am not_a private investigator financial pro or accountant but to me the evidence is compelling that carvana ’ s results are being directly propped by DRIVETIME and once the Garcias have enriched themselves the real results will emerge . I plan to open short positions against CVNA in the next few weeks after they fully transition to the SP 500"

      "selftext": "The U.S. Commerce Department will allow Nvidia to export its advanced H200 artificial intelligence accelerators to China, according to a report from Semafor, marking one of the most notable shifts in U.S. semiconductor export policy in more than a year. The decision partially rolls back restrictions that had previously barred shipments of Nvidia’s A100, H100, and H200-class GPUs to Chinese customers over national security concerns. Under the revised rules, Nvidia may resume sales of the H200 so long as exported configurations fall within newly defined performance limits and comply with enhanced government monitoring. The adjustment follows weeks of uncertainty, during which Nvidia executives repeatedly emphasized that final export approval would ultimately come from President Trump. China represents 20 to 25% of Nvidia’s data-center revenue. Restoring access even partially could meaningfully lift 2026 sales guidance.",

      "title": "Netflix vs Paramount Skydance: The $108B Battle for HBO, Harry Potter, and DC - Who Wins?",
      "selftext": "Okay so this is getting spicy. We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely don't know who wins here. Want to hear what you all think. # Quick background **Friday (Dec 5):** [Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD's studio and streaming assets]( for $72B ($27.75/share). This gets them HBO Max, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Universe, The Sopranos, etc. Basically [100 years of Warner Bros content]( \\- 6,650 films, 50,000 TV titles. **Monday (Dec 8):** [Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid]( at $30/share all-cash ($108.4B enterprise value). David Ellison going directly to shareholders, bypassing the WBD board. The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. # The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** * Cash + stock deal * $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it * Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** * All cash, $30/share * Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) * Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds * And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners * [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( # The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it. Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand. 4. **Content integration is cleaner.** Netflix knows streaming. Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. # The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal. Some analysts say [Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon]( If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin... who do you think has the edge? 3. **Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real.** Combining #1 and #3 streamers? [Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming. [Paramount bid for the entire company]( including CNN, TNT Sports, etc. # What the market is saying * [WBD up 5% to $27]( (above Netflix's $27.75 offer, betting on bidding war) * PSKY up 7% * NFLX down 3% Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins. # The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay [$5.8B breakup fee if blocked]( That's how real the antitrust risk is. If WBD chooses Paramount instead, they owe Netflix a $2.8B breakup fee. Not nothing. Ellison's argument: Paramount is smaller, less antitrust concern, faster close. Counter-argument: Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August. Adding WBD on top? That's a LOT of integration. # My take (worth nothing) I genuinely don't know. The Netflix deal makes strategic sense - they get Harry Potter, DC, HBO originals, and crush the streaming wars permanently. But $17.6B is $17.6B and shareholders might want the cash. The Trump/Ellison relationship is the X factor nobody's pricing correctly imo. # Vote time - who wins? 1. **Netflix** \\- board-approved deal holds, synergies too good, Paramount's bid is desperate 2. **Paramount Skydance** \\- cash is king, regulatory path clearer, Trump admin approves faster 3. **Netflix raises bid** \\- this becomes a $90B+ deal 4. **Neither** \\- regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning. Especially curious what the media/entertainment folks here think about the content library value. *no position in any of these names, just fascinated by the biggest media deal since... ever?*",

      "selftext": "Okay so this is getting spicy. We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely don't know who wins here. Want to hear what you all think. ## Quick background **Friday (Dec 5):** [Netflix announced a deal to buy WBD's studio and streaming assets]( for $72B ($27.75/share). This gets them HBO Max, Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, DC Universe, The Sopranos, etc. Basically [100 years of Warner Bros content]( - 6,650 films, 50,000 TV titles. **Monday (Dec 8):** [Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid]( at $30/share all-cash ($108.4B enterprise value). David Ellison going directly to shareholders, bypassing the WBD board. The premium Paramount is offering? **$17.6 billion more** than Netflix's deal. ## The money behind each bid **Netflix ($72B):** - Cash + stock deal - $5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it - Would combine #1 streamer (Netflix) with #3 (HBO Max) **Paramount Skydance ($108.4B):** - All cash, $30/share - Backed by [$40.7B from Larry Ellison]( (David's dad, Oracle co-founder) - Plus funding from Saudi, Qatar, Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds - And Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners - [Bank of America, Citi, Apollo committed $54B in debt]( ## The bull case for Netflix winning 1. **Synergies are insane.** They have [200M non-HBO Max subscribers globally]( who could be cross-sold HBO content. Revenue synergy is real. 2. **Bank of America literally said \"the throne is secured\"** on Dec 7. They see Netflix as the streaming endgame. 3. **They already have a signed deal.** WBD board approved it. Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand. 4. **Content integration is cleaner.** Netflix knows streaming. Paramount is still figuring out Paramount+ after the Skydance merger in August. ## The bull case for Paramount winning 1. **$17.6 billion more cash.** Money talks. Shareholders might prefer certainty of all-cash vs Netflix's stock component. 2. **The Trump card (literally).** [Ellison told CNBC]( that Trump \"believes in competition\" and combining Paramount + WBD creates \"a real competitor to Netflix, a real competitor to Amazon.\" And here's what nobody's talking about: [Larry Ellison (David's dad) is basically Trump's closest tech ally]( He hosted a six-figure-per-person Trump fundraiser in 2020, [dines with Trump at Mar-a-Lago regularly]( and [dropped $450M on real estate 20 minutes from Mar-a-Lago]( When asked about TikTok, Trump literally said [\"I'd love for Larry to do it.\"]( Oracle got the Stargate AI deal. Some analysts say [Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon]( If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin... who do you think has the edge? 3. **Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real.** Combining #1 and #3 streamers? [Elizabeth Warren already called it \"an anti-monopoly nightmare.\"]( Writers Guild wants it blocked. 4. **Paramount wants the WHOLE thing.** Netflix is only buying studios + streaming. [Paramount bid for the entire company]( including CNN, TNT Sports, etc. ## What the market is saying - [WBD up 5% to $27]( (above Netflix's $27.75 offer, betting on bidding war) - PSKY up 7% - NFLX down 3% Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins. ## The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay [$5.8B breakup fee if blocked]( That's how real the antitrust risk is. If WBD chooses Paramount instead, they owe Netflix a $2.8B breakup fee. Not nothing. Ellison's argument: Paramount is smaller, less antitrust concern, faster close. Counter-argument: Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August. Adding WBD on top? That's a LOT of integration. ## My take (worth nothing) I genuinely don't know. The Netflix deal makes strategic sense - they get Harry Potter, DC, HBO originals, and crush the streaming wars permanently. But $17.6B is $17.6B and shareholders might want the cash. The Trump/Ellison relationship is the X factor nobody's pricing correctly imo. ## Vote time - who wins? 1. **Netflix** - board-approved deal holds, synergies too good, Paramount's bid is desperate 2. **Paramount Skydance** - cash is king, regulatory path clearer, Trump admin approves faster 3. **Netflix raises bid** - this becomes a $90B+ deal 4. **Neither** - regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning.

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so this is getting spicy . We officially have a bidding war for Warner Bros Discovery and I genuinely dont know who wins here . Want to hear what you all think . Quick background Friday Dec 5 Netflix announced a deal to buy WBDs studio and streaming assets for $ 72B $ 27.75share . This gets them HBO Max Harry Potter Game of Thrones DC Universe The Sopranos etc . Basically 100 years of Warner Bros content 6650 films 50000 TV titles . Monday Dec 8 Paramount Skydance launches hostile bid at $ 30share allcash $ 108.4B enterprise value . David Ellison going directly to shareholders bypassing the WBD board . The premium Paramount is offering $ 17.6 billion more than Netflixs deal . The money behind each bid Netflix $ 72B Cash stock deal $ 5.8B breakup fee if regulators block it Would combine 1 streamer Netflix with 3 HBO Max Paramount Skydance $ 108.4B All cash $ 30share Backed by $ 40.7B from Larry Ellison Davids dad Oracle cofounder Plus funding from Saudi Qatar Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds And Jared Kushners Affinity Partners Bank of America Citi Apollo committed $ 54B in debt The bull case for Netflix winning 1 . Synergies are insane . They have 200M nonHBO Max subscribers globally who could be crosssold HBO content . Revenue synergy is real . 2 . Bank of America literally said the throne is secured on Dec 7 . They see Netflix as the streaming endgame . 3 . They already have a signed deal . WBD board approved it . Paramount has to convince shareholders to reject a bird in hand . 4 . Content integration is cleaner . Netflix knows streaming . Paramount is still figuring out Paramount after the Skydance merger in August . The bull case for Paramount winning 1 . $ 17.6 billion more cash . Money talks . Shareholders might prefer certainty of allcash vs Netflixs stock component . 2 . The Trump card literally . Ellison told CNBC that Trump believes in competition and combining Paramount WBD creates a real competitor to Netflix a real competitor to Amazon . And heres what nobodys_talking about Larry Ellison Davids dad is basically Trumps closest tech ally He hosted a sixfigureperperson Trump fundraiser in 2020 dines with Trump at MaraLago regularly and dropped $ 450M on real estate 20 minutes from MaraLago When asked about TikTok Trump literally said Id love for Larry to do it . Oracle got the Stargate AI deal . Some analysts say Larry is more influential with Trump than Elon If this WBD deal needs regulatory approval from the Trump admin ... who do you think has the edge 3 . Antitrust concerns for Netflix are real . Combining 1 and 3 streamers Elizabeth Warren already called it an antimonopoly nightmare . Writers Guild wants it blocked . 4 . Paramount wants the WHOLE thing . Netflix is only buying studios streaming . Paramount bid for the entire company including CNN TNT Sports etc . What the market is saying WBD up 5 % to $ 27 above Netflixs $ 27.75 offer betting on bidding war PSKY up 7 % NFLX down 3 % Market seems to think either Netflix raises or Paramount wins . The regulatory wildcard Netflix agreed to pay $ 5.8B breakup fee if blocked Thats how real the antitrust risk is . If WBD chooses Paramount instead they owe Netflix a $ 2.8B breakup fee . Not_nothing . Ellisons argument Paramount is smaller less antitrust concern faster close . Counterargument Paramount just closed the Skydance merger in August . Adding WBD on top Thats a LOT of integration . My take worth nothing_I genuinely dont know . The Netflix deal makes strategic sense they get Harry Potter DC HBO originals and crush the streaming wars permanently . But $ 17.6B is $ 17.6B and shareholders might want the cash . The TrumpEllison relationship is the X factor nobodys_pricing correctly imo . Vote time who wins 1 . Netflix boardapproved deal holds synergies too good Paramounts bid is desperate 2 . Paramount Skydance cash is king regulatory path clearer Trump admin approves faster 3 . Netflix raises bid this becomes a $ 90B deal 4 . Neither regulators block everything and WBD stays independent Drop your vote and reasoning . Especially curious what the mediaentertainment folks here think about the content library value . no position in any of these names just fascinated by the biggest media deal since ... ever"

      "selftext": "# TL;DR Here’s the whole thesis: If you believe space launches will increase; if you expect NASA, commercial satellite operators, national-security agencies, and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit, then Karman is a little-known company you *need* to know. ================================= # The Short & Sweet Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is a little-known **aerospace and defense** company posting numbers that look nothing like the obscurity of its stock. Revenue up 23% YoY, net income up 191%, and a funded backlog up 35%, with guidance calling for another year *(and beyond)* of **double-digit expansion**. For a company most of you haven’t even heard of, these are eye-popping metrics. The driver is straightforward: Karman builds high-spec structures, subsystems, and assemblies for **missiles, hypersonics, and next-gen launch vehicles**. Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–high-temperature alloys, for materials used in **strategic missile programs** where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive. That move pushed Karman deeper into **classified supply chains** tied to U.S. rearmament, allied purchases, and the global shift toward tactical missile systems. Karman also sits inside both of the next-decade launch platforms: **Blue Origin’s New Glenn and ULA’s Vulcan**. Each is designed for national security, deep-space, and commercial missions. And since Karman supplies structural components to *both* vehicles, you don’t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst. **Karman wins either way**. Karman’s core markets (missile defense, hypersonics, and launch systems) are expanding, not contracting. That makes its recent pullback attractive. **Takeaway:** Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem. The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend, and that trend will just accelerate. ================================= # The Long & Winding Karman Holdings (**$KRMN**) is an under-the-radar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. **space and missile-defense programs**. But before we talk about what this company actually *does*, we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings. After all, **numbers don’t care about narratives**. They don’t hype. They simply record the truth, especially the kind most people don't pay attention to. Karman’s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual. A company whose trajectory doesn’t match its obscurity. **Growth hiding behind small-cap camouflage**. # The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small, the numbers don’t lie. They signal momentum. And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental. # FY2024: A Record Across the Board On April 8, 2025, KRMN reported: * **Revenue**: $345.3M, **+23% YoY** * **Net income**: $12.7M, **+191.3% YoY** * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $106.1M, **+29.7% YoY** * **Funded backlog**: $579.8M, **+35.2% YoY** For a small-cap contractor, these are not ordinary numbers. This is a company stepping into a larger orbit. # 2025 Outlook: Expansion, Not Consolidation For FY2025, Karman expects: * **Revenue**: $423–$433M * **Adjusted EBITDA**: $132–$137M **Double-digit growth on top of double-digit growth**. # Q1 2025: The Trend Continued On May 13, 2025: * **EPS**: $0.05 (vs. $0.02 est.) * **Revenue**: $100.12M, **+20.6% YoY** Guidance reaffirmed. No slowdown. At this point, some of you might realize that even though you’ve never heard of this company, these numbers look interesting. And they are. Because once you peel back the veil, the reason becomes obvious. # The CEO Speaks After delivering the [Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025]( Tony Koblinski, Karman’s Chief Executive Officer, summarized it this way: >“Across numerous key metrics, we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond. >Each of our end markets delivered **double-digit topline growth** and remains **very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities** in missiles, tactical defense systems, and space and launch systems.” [Karman Space & Defense Full-Fiscal Year 2024 Financial Results]( Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside **America’s missile defense buildup, hypersonic development race, and next-generation launch ecosystem**. But to understand how deep that goes, we begin with a move that opened new doors. # The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year, Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. (MTI), a company specializing in **ultra-high-temperature refractory alloys** used in strategic missile systems. MTI works with materials such as Tantalum, Zirconium, Niobium, Vanadium, and Molybdenum. These aren’t ordinary metals. They are **engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys**. With this acquisition, Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities, access to high-specification missile programs, **deeper integration into classified supply chains**, increased revenue and EBITDA, and expanded design and manufacturing scope. KRMN reaffirmed that it is not just a supplier, but a *strategic* supplier. # Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles. Why? Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished, global conflicts have continued to drive demand, allies are purchasing next-generation tactical systems, and missile defense is entering a new strategic era. Karman provides the structures, subsystems, and assemblies that make these systems operational. Now, it’s not about whether there’s a war or not. Of course, I don’t want *any* wars. But even in peacetime, **missile defense isn’t slowing down**. It’s accelerating. And now Karman sits closer to the core. # Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highest-temperature, highest-priority arms race on Earth. **Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade**. Every major power is investing, testing, and racing toward Mach-5+ platforms. But **few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses**. Karman is one of them. This segment’s revenue surged thanks to well-funded programs in both development and production, **backed by aggressive government budgets**. Karman’s offerings (propulsion, deployable shrouds, launchers, energetic subsystems) are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems. This is not speculative work. This is strategic infrastructure. # Space and Launch Systems This is **where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge**. Revenue here increased due to Karman’s involvement in two next-generation launch vehicles. # Blue Origin’s New Glenn A heavy-lift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites, space infrastructure, and future deep-space missions. It is still in a development stage. Although, on November 13, 2025, the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time. The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027. Blue Origin’s customer base: * Commercial satellite operators. * Government payloads. * Potential national-security missions. [New Glenn]( is designed to compete with SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy. Its reusable first stage, massive payload capacity, and **long-term contract potential with DoD and NASA** make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem. Karman supplies components used in New Glenn’s structures and launch systems. # ULA’s Vulcan A next-generation launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). [Vulcan]( is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV, the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. national-security launches. It has already flown its first successful mission. This rocket is built to serve: * U.S. Space Force. * DoD national-security missions. * Commercial payloads. * NASA deep-space missions. Vulcan is engineered specifically for **National Security Space Launch (NSSL)** contracts: The elite, highest-priority, and highest-specification launches in America’s defense architecture and orbital missions. It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defense-related payloads over the next decade. And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan’s architecture. # Whichever Rocket Wins, Karman Wins This isn’t about picking sides in the rocket race. It isn’t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads, or which timeline slips, or which program accelerates. Karman supplies critical hardware to *both* ULA’s Vulcan and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. Karman’s components run through the veins of *both* launch systems. Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts, Karman wins with it. If national-security payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another, the outcome is the same: **Karman benefits either way**. # Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play. **If you understand this one idea**, the rest of the thesis can open itself to you. **You don’t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade**. You don’t have to choose heads or tails. Because with Karman, **it isn’t about the side of the coin**. **It’s just about the coin being flipped into the air**. **As long as rockets are being launched** (commercial, government, national-security, deep-space, doesn’t matter) **Karman benefits**. The rivalry is irrelevant. **The activity itself is the catalyst**. # The Short-Term Decline Now, yes, Karman, like many other growth names, was bruised over the past few weeks. The stock is down –24.80% since the close on November 3, 2025. Personally, I bought (and keep buying) the dip *gradually*. There was support in the high $50s (Karman has bounced from there, though), and the stock did ride a +23.37% rally in four days (Nov 21-26), so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap. Check the chart. Once it runs, it runs north fast. You should also know the KRMN play, although great for swings, is mostly meant for the **long term**. This is a **structural story**, not a short-lived trade. I did buy a handful of **KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls** for cheap, though. Of course, this one is a cheap, low-risk, high-reward play if it works. Quite simply, the stock can move $10 in a couple of days, and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike, these become multi-baggers. But, again, the main play is for the long-term. # Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23, portfolio manager [Randy Gwirtzman]( of Baron Capital published a Barron’s article highlighting small-cap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential. He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward **companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions**. His focus, however, is on profitability, a key filter, especially when bond yields spike. Karman Holdings popped up on his list. And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could **benefit enormously** in the coming years: **Trump’s Golden Dome plans**. Now, everything in this post has been the backdrop, the scaffolding, the necessary foundation. In my next post, if this DD gets approved/noticed, I’ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself, what it is, why it matters, and why a small, overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly, along with several more developments from KRMN.

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Here ’ s the whole thesis If you believe space launches will increase if you expect NASA commercial satellite operators nationalsecurity agencies and private launch companies will keep expanding activity into orbit then Karman is a littleknown company you need to know . The Short Sweet Karman Holdings $ KRMN is a littleknown aerospace and defense company posting numbers that look nothing_like the obscurity of its stock . Revenue up 23 % YoY net income up 191 % and a funded backlog up 35 % with guidance calling for another year and beyond of doubledigit expansion . For a company most of you haven ’ t even heard of these are eyepopping metrics . The driver is straightforward Karman builds highspec structures subsystems and assemblies for missiles hypersonics and nextgen launch vehicles . Its acquisition of Metal Technology Inc. brought capabilities in ultra–hightemperature alloys for materials used in strategic missile programs where steel melts and only special refractory metals survive . That move pushed Karman deeper into classified supply chains tied to U.S. rearmament allied purchases and the global shift toward tactical missile systems . Karman also sits inside both of the nextdecade launch platforms Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn and ULA ’ s Vulcan . Each is designed for national security deepspace and commercial missions . And since Karman supplies structural components to both vehicles you don ’ t need to predict which rocket will win future contracts because the activity itself is the catalyst . Karman wins either way . Karman ’ s core markets missile defense hypersonics and launch systems are expanding not_contracting . That makes its recent pullback attractive . Takeaway Karman is a rare case of a true hidden gem . The company sits inside every major missile and launch trend and that trend will just accelerate . The Long Winding Karman Holdings $ KRMN is an undertheradar supplier embedded across some of the most important U.S. space and missiledefense programs . But before we talk about what this company actually does we start with the trail of evidence buried in its filings . After all numbers don ’ t care about narratives . They don ’ t hype . They simply record the truth especially the kind most people dont pay attention to . Karman ’ s disclosures reveal something quietly unusual . A company whose trajectory doesn ’ t match its obscurity . Growth hiding behind smallcap camouflage . The Numbers Speak Before the Narrative While the company may be small the numbers don ’ t lie . They signal momentum . And momentum in an obscure defense contractor is rarely accidental . FY2024 A Record Across the Board On April 8 2025 KRMN reported Revenue $ 345.3M 23 % YoY Net income $ 12.7M 191.3 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 106.1M 29.7 % YoY Funded backlog $ 579.8M 35.2 % YoY For a smallcap contractor these are not_ordinary numbers . This is a company stepping into a larger orbit . 2025 Outlook Expansion Not_Consolidation For FY2025 Karman expects Revenue $ 423– $ 433M Adjusted EBITDA $ 132– $ 137M Doubledigit growth on top of doubledigit growth . Q1 2025 The Trend Continued On May 13 2025 EPS $ 0.05 vs. $ 0.02 est . Revenue $ 100.12M 20.6 % YoY Guidance reaffirmed . No_slowdown . At this point some of you might realize that even though you ’ ve never_heard of this company these numbers look interesting . And they are . Because once you peel back the veil the reason becomes obvious . The CEO Speaks After delivering the Business Outlook for the Full Year 2025 Tony Koblinski Karman ’ s Chief Executive Officer summarized it this way “ Across numerous key metrics we achieved record performance in 2024 that positions us very well for growth in 2025 and beyond . Each of our end markets delivered doubledigit topline growth and remains very well aligned with existing and emerging customer and national priorities in missiles tactical defense systems and space and launch systems. ” Karman Space Defense FullFiscal Year 2024 Financial Results Karman is one of the quiet cogs inside America ’ s missile defense buildup hypersonic development race and nextgeneration launch ecosystem . But to understand how deep that goes we begin with a move that opened new doors . The Metallurgical Key Earlier this year Karman acquired Metal Technology Inc. MTI a company specializing in ultrahightemperature refractory alloys used in strategic missile systems . MTI works with materials such as Tantalum Zirconium Niobium Vanadium and Molybdenum . These aren ’ t ordinary metals . They are engineered for environments where temperatures reach levels that melt steel and vaporize conventional alloys . With this acquisition Karman gained new metallurgical capabilities access to highspecification missile programs deeper integration into classified supply chains increased revenue and EBITDA and expanded design and manufacturing scope . KRMN reaffirmed that it is not_just a supplier but a strategic supplier . Missile and Integrated Defense Systems The revenue in this segment grew due to key programs entering or continuing production cycles . Why Because U.S. military inventory is being replenished global conflicts have continued to drive demand allies are purchasing nextgeneration tactical systems and missile defense is entering a new strategic era . Karman provides the structures subsystems and assemblies that make these systems operational . Now it ’ s not_about whether there ’ s a war or not_Of course I don ’ t want any wars . But even in peacetime missile defense isn ’ t slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . And now Karman sits closer to the core . Hypersonics and Strategic Missile Defense It has been called the highesttemperature highestpriority arms race on Earth . Hypersonics is the battlefield of the next decade . Every major power is investing testing and racing toward Mach5 platforms . But few companies can build components that survive these temperatures and stresses . Karman is one of them . This segment ’ s revenue surged thanks to wellfunded programs in both development and production backed by aggressive government budgets . Karman ’ s offerings propulsion deployable shrouds launchers energetic subsystems are precisely the components required for hypersonic missile systems . This is not_speculative work . This is strategic infrastructure . Space and Launch Systems This is where commercial demand and defense priorities finally converge . Revenue here increased due to Karman ’ s involvement in two nextgeneration launch vehicles . Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn A heavylift reusable orbital rocket whose purpose is to launch satellites space infrastructure and future deepspace missions . It is still in a development stage . Although on November 13 2025 the New Glenn first stage landed successfully for the first time . The rocket is scheduled to launch the Blue Moon Mark 1 lunar lander on robotic missions in early 2026 and late 2027 . Blue Origin ’ s customer base Commercial satellite operators . Government payloads . Potential nationalsecurity missions . New Glenn is designed to compete with SpaceX ’ s Falcon Heavy . Its reusable first stage massive payload capacity and longterm contract potential with DoD and NASA make it a cornerstone of the growing commercial and government launch ecosystem . Karman supplies components used in New Glenn ’ s structures and launch systems . ULA ’ s Vulcan A nextgeneration launch vehicle by United Launch Alliance a joint venture between Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT . Vulcan is the United Launch Alliance successor to Atlas V and Delta IV the legacy rockets that became the backbone of U.S. nationalsecurity launches . It has already flown its first successful mission . This rocket is built to serve U.S. Space Force . DoD nationalsecurity missions . Commercial payloads . NASA deepspace missions . Vulcan is engineered specifically for National Security Space Launch NSSL contracts The elite highestpriority and highestspecification launches in America ’ s defense architecture and orbital missions . It is expected to be one of the main U.S. rockets for defenserelated payloads over the next decade . And Karman is inside that build because Karman supplies structural components and subsystems that go directly into Vulcan ’ s architecture . Whichever Rocket Wins Karman Wins This isn ’ t about picking sides in the rocket race . It isn ’ t about tracking which launch vehicle secures more payloads or which timeline slips or which program accelerates . Karman supplies critical hardware to both ULA ’ s Vulcan and Blue Origin ’ s New Glenn . Karman ’ s components run through the veins of both launch systems . Whichever rocket wins the next wave of contracts Karman wins with it . If nationalsecurity payloads shift in one direction or commercial contracts in another the outcome is the same Karman benefits either way . Understanding the Core of the Play This is a crucial hinge of the entire play . If you understand this one idea the rest of the thesis can open itself to you . You don ’ t need to decide whether New Glenn or Vulcan will dominate the next decade . You don ’ t have to choose heads or tails . Because with Karman it isn ’ t about the side of the coin . It ’ s just about the coin being flipped into the air . As long as rockets are being launched commercial government nationalsecurity deepspace doesn ’ t matter Karman benefits . The rivalry is irrelevant . The activity itself is the catalyst . The ShortTerm Decline Now yes Karman like many other growth names was bruised over the past few weeks . The stock is down –24.80 % since the close on November 3 2025 . Personally I bought and keep buying the dip gradually . There was support in the high $ 50s Karman has bounced from there though and the stock did ride a 23.37 % rally in four days Nov 2126 so keep that in mind since this is a company below 10 billion in market cap . Check the chart . Once it runs it runs north fast . You should also know the KRMN play although great for swings is mostly meant for the long term . This is a structural story not_a shortlived trade . I did buy a handful of KRMN Dec 19 2025 80 Calls for cheap though . Of course this one is a cheap lowrisk highreward play if it works . Quite simply the stock can move $ 10 in a couple of days and if KRMN even gets in the ballpark to sniff that strike these become multibaggers . But again the main play is for the longterm . Why Smart Money Is Interested On May 23 portfolio manager Randy Gwirtzman of Baron Capital published a Barron ’ s article highlighting smallcap defense and cybersecurity stocks he believes have strong potential . He noted that many investors are shifting away from economically sensitive sectors and toward companies capable of compounding regardless of macro conditions . His focus however is on profitability a key filter especially when bond yields spike . Karman Holdings popped up on his list . And he understands there is a powerful reason this company could benefit enormously in the coming years Trump ’ s Golden Dome plans . Now everything in this post has been the backdrop the scaffolding the necessary foundation . In my next post if this DD gets approvednoticed I ’ ll guide you deeper into the Golden Dome itself what it is why it matters and why a small overlooked company like Karman is positioned to benefit directly along with several more developments from KRMN . Have a nice day ."

      "title": "Is Tesla Really Slowing Down or Just Resetting?",
      "selftext": "After following Tesla closely for a while now, I keep wondering if what i'm seeing is just a pause or something more significant. Free cash flow jumped by over 540% in FY 2025 Q3, which is huge, but at the same time gross margin dropped to 17% and EPS growth fell by 64%. It makes me think how a company can produce that much cash while its core earnings are under such pressure. The numbers seem to be pulling in different directions and that tension is hard to ignore. I noticed analysts are all over the map on Tesla. Price targets range from $145 up to $860. Some, like Piper Sandler and Wedbush, see a lot of potential upside while Morgan Stanley points to high valuations and forecasts a 20% decline in electric vehicle sales by 2026. and i wonder if the market is really entering an EV winter or is this just a temporary slowdown as competition and regulatory pressure build? For me, it feels like there is more happening beneath the surface than the short-term metrics suggest. Insider activity adds another layer to consider. Elon Musk received a stock award valued at $141.57 billion while Kimbal Musk’s stock gift was much smaller. That contrast makes me feel there is still a lot of confidence in Tesla’s long-term direction even if it doesn’t show in the quarterly numbers even the volume i’m seeing on uex like bitget futures on tsla is making me wonder if people are still having high hope in it, but another mind is still wondering whether they are just there for the META stock extras. Operationally, the company is projected to meet seven out of twelve milestones in Musk’s compensation plan by 2035, which tells me growth might not be disappearing, it is just taking a different path than some might expect. But right now, I’m leaning toward staying curious and watching closely. Cash flow, market sentiment, analyst expectations, and insider moves all seem to tell slightly different stories. To me, that is what makes Tesla so fascinating right now. you?",

      "selftext_processed": "After following Tesla closely for a while now I keep wondering if what im seeing is just a pause or something more significant . Free cash flow jumped by over 540 % in FY 2025 Q3 which is huge but at the same time gross margin dropped to 17 % and EPS growth fell by 64 % . It makes me think how a company can produce that much cash while its core earnings are under such pressure . The numbers seem to be pulling in different directions and that tension is hard to ignore . I noticed analysts are all over the map on Tesla . Price targets range from $ 145 up to $ 860 . Some like Piper Sandler and Wedbush see a lot of potential upside while Morgan Stanley points to high valuations and forecasts a 20 % decline in electric vehicle sales by 2026. and i wonder if the market is really entering an EV winter or is this just a temporary slowdown as competition and regulatory pressure build For me it feels like there is more happening beneath the surface than the shortterm metrics suggest . Insider activity adds another layer to consider . Elon Musk received a stock award valued at $ 141.57 billion while Kimbal Musk ’ s stock gift was much smaller . That contrast makes me feel there is still a lot of confidence in Tesla ’ s longterm direction even if it doesn ’ t show in the quarterly numbers even the volume i ’ m seeing on uex like bitget futures on tsla is making me wonder if people are still having high hope in it but another mind is still wondering whether they are just there for the META stock extras . Operationally the company is projected to meet seven out of twelve milestones in Musk ’ s compensation plan by 2035 which tells me growth might not_be disappearing it is just taking a different path than some might expect . But right now I ’ m leaning toward staying curious and watching closely . Cash flow market sentiment analyst expectations and insider moves all seem to tell slightly different stories . To me that is what makes Tesla so fascinating right now . you"

      "selftext": "US stocks weakened overall today, primarily due to market uncertainty surrounding the Fed's future interest rate policy, rising bond yields, and some institutions reducing their holdings due to concerns about overvaluation in the technology sector, leading to cautious market sentiment. Major stock indices and the Nasdaq ETFs (SPY, QQQ) all declined slightly; Apple shares fell, Google shares fell more, while Microsoft remained relatively resilient, rising slightly. Overall, given the uncertainty in the macroeconomy, this is a normal technical adjustment. From a technical perspective, the Nasdaq index formed a double top pattern on the hourly chart and subsequently retreated. Market volatility is normal during such a volatile period, but for individual investors, prudent asset allocation and appropriate risk management are more important. Long-term planning and maintaining a margin of safety are always more reassuring than chasing highs and lows.",

      "selftext": "Waymo, the robotaxi unit owned by Alphabet, has crossed 450,000 weekly paid rides, according to a letter from investor Tiger Global viewed by CNBC. That’s almost double the milestone it hit in April, when Waymo reported 250,000 paid robotaxi rides a week in the U.S. “Waymo is the clear leader in autonomous driving, recently surpassing 450k trips per week with a product that is 10x safer than human drivers,” Tiger Global wrote in a letter to investors announcing the launch of a new fund. Tiger’s 450,000-ride estimate is based on publicly available data. Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger’s 2024 fund. Waymo declined to comment. This year, Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions, including its debut on freeways in three cities, and autonomous driving in cities including Miami, Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Orlando. The latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring self-driving competitor Tesla, which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ride-hailing service in the Bay Area. Tesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not driverless like Waymo’s fleet vehicles. According to Tesla’s latest earnings call, executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin, and more than one million in the Bay Area. In July, Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles. Source: [",

That ’ s almost double the milestone it hit in April when Waymo reported 250000 paid robotaxi rides a week in the U.S. “ Waymo is the clear leader in autonomous driving recently surpassing 450k trips per week with a product that is 10x safer than human drivers ” Tiger Global wrote in a letter to investors announcing the launch of a new fund . Tiger ’ s 450000ride estimate is based on publicly available data . Waymo is one of the largest positions in Tiger ’ s 2024 fund . Waymo declined to comment . This year Waymo has also announced a slew of expansions including its debut on freeways in three cities and autonomous driving in cities including Miami Dallas Houston San Antonio and Orlando . The latest milestone is also another sign that Waymo is continuing to push ahead of aspiring selfdriving competitor Tesla which has run limited pilots in Austin and operates a ridehailing service in the Bay Area . Tesla vehicles include human drivers or safety supervisors on board and are not_driverless like Waymo ’ s fleet vehicles . According to Tesla ’ s latest earnings call executives said the company hit a quarter of a million miles with its fleet in Austin and more than one million in the Bay Area . In July Waymo announced 100 million total fully autonomous miles . Source"

The move which would send Nvidia H200s to China seeks to find a middle ground between those who oppose exports of any advanced AI chips and those who worry that restrictions will merely hand the market to Chinese competitors . It also aims to satisfy the Chinese government which has blocked imports of less powerful chips such as Nvidia ’ s H20 . The move which has the support of Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick could bolster Nvidia ’ s revenue by opening up a huge market for its chips while ensuring US technology remains the standard worldwide . The US enacted strict export restrictions under the Biden Administration in an effort to prevent China from catching up on AI . But some in the White House believe those restrictions have more or less failed according to people familiar with their thinking . Source"

      "selftext": "Morgan Stanley just downgraded Tesla to a hold, saying the stock is now at a full valuation even as Elon Musk continues to pitch the company as a future robotics and AI powerhouse. Right now, Tesla is trading at around 210x forward earnings, making it one of the most expensive stocks in the entire S&P 500 second only to Warner Bros. Discovery, and well ahead of Palantir. That valuation already assumes big success in areas like robotics and artificial intelligence, according to the bank. The downgrade isn’t a call that Tesla’s future vision is wrong it’s more about the stock price already reflecting those ambitions. In other words, the growth story may still be intact, but the risk-reward at these levels looks stretched. Feels like this is less about Tesla as a company and more about how much future investors are already paying for today. Source: [",

      "selftext": "According to a Reuters report, SoftBank and Nvidia are in discussions to invest in Skild AI as part of a funding round that could exceed $1 billion and value the robotics-focused AI startup at around $14 billion. A term sheet seen by Reuters suggests this would be one of the largest private funding rounds in the robotics AI space so far. Skild AI develops foundation models for robots, which are large AI systems designed to help machines understand and interact with the physical world a different challenge than text- or image-based AI. While language models dominate headlines, robotics models aim to bring intelligence into warehouses, factories, logistics, and even household environments. The potential investor lineup is notable. SoftBank has a long history of large tech bets, especially in AI and robotics, going back to its early ARM investment and its aggressive Vision Fund era. Nvidia, on the other hand, continues to expand beyond just selling chips quietly positioning itself across the entire AI ecosystem, from data centers to software and now physical-world AI. If this deal goes through, it would signal that big money is shifting focus from just generative AI into real-world automation, where returns could take longer but potentially reshape entire industries. It also raises questions about valuations: a $14B price tag for a private robotics startup shows how aggressive capital remains in the AI space, even after recent volatility in tech stocks. Curious to hear what others think Is robotics the next real wave after generative AI, or are we getting ahead of adoption again with these valuations? Source: [",

      "selftext_processed": "According to a Reuters report SoftBank and Nvidia are in discussions to invest in Skild AI as part of a funding round that could exceed $ 1 billion and value the roboticsfocused AI startup at around $ 14 billion . A term sheet seen by Reuters suggests this would be one of the largest private funding rounds in the robotics AI space so far . Skild AI develops foundation models for robots which are large AI systems designed to help machines understand and interact with the physical world a different challenge than text or imagebased AI . While language models dominate headlines robotics models aim to bring intelligence into warehouses factories logistics and even household environments . The potential investor lineup is notable . SoftBank has a long history of large tech bets especially in AI and robotics going back to its early ARM investment and its aggressive Vision Fund era . Nvidia on the other hand continues to expand beyond just selling chips quietly positioning itself across the entire AI ecosystem from data centers to software and now physicalworld AI . If this deal goes through it would signal that big money is shifting focus from just generative AI into realworld automation where returns could take longer but potentially reshape entire industries . It also raises questions about valuations a $ 14B price tag for a private robotics startup shows how aggressive capital remains in the AI space even after recent volatility in tech stocks . Curious to hear what others think Is robotics the next real wave after generative AI or are we getting ahead of adoption again with these valuations Source"

      "selftext": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics ($MLTX) YOLO. I added on to my position here today. **I still like the stock.** TL;DR: MoonLake ($MLTX) is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease (CID) powerhouse. We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15, 2025. This is just the beginning. MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market. We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape. DD is available here: [ We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month. PPP is an untapped market; there are no approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year. [ Also, I don’t really like talking about personal details, but here is some context: My personal life is a mess. I’m living out of a hotel right now. My wife kicked me out of the house, removed my access from the Tesla app, and took our only car. [Telsa]( I currently have a rental car, and the internet here is horrible. I’m moving to another one later today; my morning is stacked with meetings. I need to physically move hotels, as well as secure various accounts. My soon-to-be ex-wife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night. I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently, which I already don’t have access to trade. (Side note: If my soon-to-be ex-wife happens to read this: please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children) [Sneaky Links?]( I say this for context; I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while, but there are distractions everywhere. I’ll try and answer any questions as they come up, but that may not be until later because my personal life is a mess, and I think everyone has a right to know what I’m going through for perspective. I said weeks ago here: That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car, maybe a house: [Reddit r\\/InvestingandTrading]( I’m buying another car and likely another house. I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I’m not selling MLTX stock. Luckily, I have other trades like this I can free up capital with: [Silver 100&#37; YTD]( And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver, even at these levels. With the long standing global fiscal deficits, the increasing global debt levels, the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization. Debasement has to accelerate here. This is bullish for real assets. Stock valuations are currently elevated. Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high? TINA. Increasingly, there is no alternative. Holders of debt-based currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power. That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively. Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand, and a persistent supply deficit. We have already seen cracks in the silver market, and the world needs hard money now more than ever. That just goes to say, as much as I like silver, I like MLTX more. I don’t reduce my silver position lightly. MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career, and the catalysts are staggering: [MLTX Catalyst Pipeline]( I’ve said before I don’t like price targets, and I’ve said MLTX can 3X, 4X, or 5X by next year. Next year is only a few weeks away. MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this. The opportunity across the CID space is huge. A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization. That equates to right around $140 a share. Long-term, MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address. [Possible SLK Indications]( On top of this, MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen. The company is quick, capital-efficient, and transparent. They should not need to dilute going forward; they have a cash runway well into 2027. They are not burdened by any massive debt. Additionally, they have a non-dilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization. This is a management team that respects shareholders. This is a company that I want to be part of. Some context on options: Please be responsible here. MLTX is still a small cap stock. MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity. I can't recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking. I have December 2025 calls because it was a very cost-effective way to gain leverage, and it’s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX. I am willing to lose the entire investment, and to make these pay off, I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don’t expect to be released until well after the expiration date. I am not relying on the official FDA meeting minutes. I expect these things to happen, but the timing is tight. The timing risk is real, and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration, they are worthless. If I had limited capital, I was willing to lose; that’s my lottery ticket. But if they pay off – I’m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options. Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best. A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher. I also have some other short-dated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation; the bulk of my position is as a long-term MLTX shareholder. This is not financial advice. But please take this advice: don’t play the lottery if you don’t have the capital to lose, and do your due diligence first. Not just on MLTX, but any investment.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake Immunotherapeutics $ MLTX YOLO . I added on to my position here today . I still like the stock . TLDR MoonLake $ MLTX is primed to be a chronic inflammatory disease CID powerhouse . We have an upcoming FDA Type B meeting on December 15 2025 . This is just the beginning . MoonLake has a shareholder friendly management team and a massive potential addressable market . We already have a robust dataset from various clinical trials on SLK efficacy across various indications in the CID landscape . DD is available here We recently got a Phase 2 LEDA data readout just last month . PPP is an untapped market there are no_approved treatments for PPP in the US or EU and the company plans to move forward with a Phase 3 next year . Also I don ’ t really like talking about personal details but here is some context My personal life is a mess . I ’ m living out of a hotel right now . My wife kicked me out of the house removed my access from the Tesla app and took our only car . Telsa I currently have a rental car and the internet here is horrible . I ’ m moving to another one later today my morning is stacked with meetings . I need to physically move hotels as well as secure various accounts . My soontobe exwife linked her new bank account to one of my Fidelity accounts last night . I set up UTMA accounts for my kids that each have about 100K in them currently which I already don ’ t have access to trade . Side note If my soontobe exwife happens to read this please take some free cash in there and invest it in MLTX for the children Sneaky Links I say this for context I believe I am finally seeing things more clearly than I have in a while but there are distractions everywhere . I ’ ll try and answer any questions as they come up but that may not_be until later because my personal life is a mess and I think everyone has a right to know what I ’ m going through for perspective . I said weeks ago here That I fully expect MLTX to buy me a car maybe a house Reddit rInvestingandTrading I ’ m buying another car and likely another house . I fully expect MLTX stock to more than pay for it… But I ’ m not_selling MLTX stock . Luckily I have other trades like this I can free up capital with Silver 10037 YTD And anyone who knows me personally knows I like silver even at these levels . With the long standing global fiscal deficits the increasing global debt levels the cost to service this debt is going to be increasingly monetization . Debasement has to accelerate here . This is bullish for real assets . Stock valuations are currently elevated . Does it make sense that stock valuations are this high TINA . Increasingly there is no_alternative . Holders of debtbased currencies are going to increasingly lose purchasing power . That dynamic is outstandingly bullish for real assets comparatively . Silver is positioned as one of the most atractive metals right now with a tight supply and robust industrial demand and a persistent supply deficit . We have already seen cracks in the silver market and the world needs hard money now more than ever . That just goes to say as much as I like silver I like MLTX more . I don ’ t reduce my silver position lightly . MLTX is poised as the single greatest asymmetric setup I have seen in my investment career and the catalysts are staggering MLTX Catalyst Pipeline I ’ ve said before I don ’ t like price targets and I ’ ve said MLTX can 3X 4X or 5X by next year . Next year is only a few weeks away . MLTX is currently a 1 billion dollar company as I write this . The opportunity across the CID space is huge . A 10X from here only needs MLTX to hit roughly a 10 billion market capitalization . That equates to right around $ 140 a share . Longterm MLTX appreciation can potentially rise much higher with the variety of CID indications SLK can possibly address . Possible SLK Indications On top of this MoonLake appears to have one of the best management teams I have seen . The company is quick capitalefficient and transparent . They should not_need to dilute going forward they have a cash runway well into 2027 . They are not_burdened by any massive debt . Additionally they have a nondilutive debt facility in place to provide additional funding well into potential commercialization . This is a management team that respects shareholders . This is a company that I want to be part of . Some context on options Please be responsible here . MLTX is still a small cap stock . MLTX options are thinly traded with wide spreads and low liquidity . I cant recommend trading these unless you fully understand the risks you are taking . I have December 2025 calls because it was a very costeffective way to gain leverage and it ’ s a very small percentage of my overall allocation to MLTX . I am willing to lose the entire investment and to make these pay off I am pretty much relying on a positive statement from the company after the Dec 15 FDA meeting outlining a path forward for an SLK BLA for HS prior to expiration as the official minutes from the meeting I don ’ t expect to be released until well after the expiration date . I am not_relying on the official FDA meeting minutes . I expect these things to happen but the timing is tight . The timing risk is real and if this catalyst misses the tight window of the Dec options expiration they are worthless . If I had limited capital I was willing to lose that ’ s my lottery ticket . But if they pay off – I ’ m looking at a potential 100X or more on the invested capital on those options . Taking asymmetric payoff on an asymmetric stock is capital efficiency at its best . A path forward to SLK approval after the Dec 15 FDA Type B meeting could rerate MLTX violently higher . I also have some other shortdated calls I put on just to gain inexpensive leverage to potential MLTX appreciation the bulk of my position is as a longterm MLTX shareholder . This is not_financial advice . But please take this advice don ’ t play the lottery if you don ’ t have the capital to lose and do your due diligence first . Not_just on MLTX but any investment . Misinformation is everywhere . Trade smart stay disciplined Richard Doxtator MBA CFA"

If you had to choose one individual stock for a long-term tech tilt, would you go with Meta or Microsoft? Microsoft seems strongly positioned in AI through Azure + OpenAI, while Meta has strong advertising growth and LLaMA, but is more volatile. Which one do you think offers the better long-term risk/reward profile? Thanks!",

For me, consistency has been the only thing that has really come out. It's not exciting, but it works.",

Total billionaire wealth rose to a record $15.8 trillion by the end of Q3, up about 13% from last year. Out of the total, 2,059 billionaires are self-made while 860 inherited their wealth. This is the second-highest number of new billionaires UBS has ever recorded, behind only 2021. Over the last four years alone, 727 people have crossed the billionaire mark. While tech and AI still dominate headlines, this year’s new billionaires came from a wider mix of sectors including software, genetics, infrastructure, natural gas, and even restaurants.

Well lo and behold the stock never went down and has since had a historic run and is now sitting at $245… what are my options? Fidelity’s platform allows me to roll or close but at this point I’m not sure what the best option is, if I close the position I’m pretty sure I would be out over $10k. Any help is appreciated.",

Well lo and behold the stock never_went down and has since had a historic run and is now sitting at $ 245… what are my options Fidelity ’ s platform allows me to roll or close but at this point I ’ m not_sure what the best option is if I close the position I ’ m pretty sure I would be out over $ 10k . Any help is appreciated ."

      "selftext": "Let’s say John keeps a lightbulb on in an empty room for 20 hours, after which his name and the number 1 are written into a public table. Mike keeps the same kind of lightbulb on for 100 hours, so the number 5 is written next to his name. The numbers proportionally represent the energy spent. Later, Alex pays 100,000 dollars to have the number 1 written next to his name, and to have everything next to John’s name erased to 0. The question: Did John \"mine\" some coins or create money or an asset? Did Alex invest? No. It is funny to even ask. John and Mike spent energy and received some kind of measure of that expenditure. That is all that happened. Alex simply bought that measure, which updated the table. No money or asset was created, and there is nothing to invest in. There is only a table with numbers. This is exactly how Bitcoin works. Instead of a lightbulb in an empty room, energy is wasted on useless guessing of hash values. The result is a numerical metric of energy expenditure (btc). After that, people pay to have that metric placed next to their IDs, and these entries are stored in a distributed table called the blockchain. There is nothing to invest in because investment always rests on a resource that generates a return. Let’s look at examples to make this obvious. With stocks, there is a company that creates profit and has capital. Returns in the form of dividends, buybacks, or liquidation value come from these sources. With bonds, there is a debtor who must repay the debt. The dollar is a more complex type of investment. Here is how it works in practice. A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of nothing. The company uses those dollars to pay workers and buy machinery and then produces, say, a car. You buy the car and pay with dollars. The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan. When the bank receives the dollars, it simply deletes them, removes them from its balance sheet, and they disappear from the market. You received a car, and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished. The return, in the form of the car, came from the company that owed the bank. Or another example: you pay taxes to the government in dollars. The government uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve. Those dollars are deleted from the Fed’s balance sheet and disappear from the market. You received a service, meaning your tax obligation was erased and you do not go to jail. Again, the return in the form of that service came from the debtor (the government). Bitcoin is not issued like a company share or as someone’s debt, so that a company or debtor could generate returns for Bitcoin holders. Also, there is no money, commodity, or asset because every such thing provides some benefit to people, either through the returns mentioned above or directly. Gold conducts electricity and decorates. Wheat feeds. Oil powers machines and heats homes. An MP3 provides entertainment. A painting provides visual experience. Casino chips and gift cards pay out money or goods. All of these things have clearly measurable usefulness for people. Bitcoins (btc), as a metric of energy spent, do none of that. Now, why individuals and institutions pay enormous sums for this metric, why they call it 'money', 'an investment', or 'an asset', and why they call its arbitrary limit 'scarcity', is a phenomenon that one day many fields will study: from cultural anthropologists and scholars of religion, to philosophers and cognitive psychologists, to behavioral economists and experts on memetics. They will study it as the greatest, most expensive, and most successful collective digital cult or mythic phenomenon in the history of humankind.",

      "selftext_processed": "Let ’ s say John keeps a lightbulb on in an empty room for 20 hours after which his name and the number 1 are written into a public table . Mike keeps the same kind of lightbulb on for 100 hours so the number 5 is written next to his name . The numbers proportionally represent the energy spent . Later Alex pays 100000 dollars to have the number 1 written next to his name and to have everything next to John ’ s name erased to 0 . The question Did John mine some coins or create money or an asset Did Alex invest No_It is funny to even ask . John and Mike spent energy and received some kind of measure of that expenditure . That is all that happened . Alex simply bought that measure which updated the table . No_money or asset was created and there is nothing_to invest in . There is only a table with numbers . This is exactly how Bitcoin works . Instead of a lightbulb in an empty room energy is wasted on useless guessing of hash values . The result is a numerical metric of energy expenditure btc . After that people pay to have that metric placed next to their IDs and these entries are stored in a distributed table called the blockchain . There is nothing_to invest in because investment always rests on a resource that generates a return . Let ’ s look at examples to make this obvious . With stocks there is a company that creates profit and has capital . Returns in the form of dividends buybacks or liquidation value come from these sources . With bonds there is a debtor who must repay the debt . The dollar is a more complex type of investment . Here is how it works in practice . A bank lends money to a company by creating dollars out of nothing_The company uses those dollars to pay workers and buy machinery and then produces say a car . You buy the car and pay with dollars . The company then takes those dollars back to the bank to repay the loan . When the bank receives the dollars it simply deletes them removes them from its balance sheet and they disappear from the market . You received a car and the dollar as an investment did its job and vanished . The return in the form of the car came from the company that owed the bank . Or another example you pay taxes to the government in dollars . The government uses those dollars to repay its bonds held by the Federal Reserve . Those dollars are deleted from the Fed ’ s balance sheet and disappear from the market . You received a service meaning your tax obligation was erased and you do not_go to jail . Again the return in the form of that service came from the debtor the government . Bitcoin is not_issued like a company share or as someone ’ s debt so that a company or debtor could generate returns for Bitcoin holders . Also there is no_money commodity or asset because every such thing provides some benefit to people either through the returns mentioned above or directly . Gold conducts electricity and decorates . Wheat feeds . Oil powers machines and heats homes . An MP3 provides entertainment . A painting provides visual experience . Casino chips and gift cards pay out money or goods . All of these things have clearly measurable usefulness for people . Bitcoins btc as a metric of energy spent do none of that . Now why individuals and institutions pay enormous sums for this metric why they call it money an investment or an asset and why they call its arbitrary limit scarcity is a phenomenon that one day many fields will study from cultural anthropologists and scholars of religion to philosophers and cognitive psychologists to behavioral economists and experts on memetics . They will study it as the greatest most expensive and most successful collective digital cult or mythic phenomenon in the history of humankind ."

      "selftext": "*I am just trying to sharpen my analytical skills. My reports are designed for informational purposes only and do not constitute investment advice. Do your own due diligence and contact a professional before investing.* EV: 10.87B, trailing P/E: 5.12, P/S: 0.14, P/B: 0.84, profit Margin: -9.44%, Ret on Equity: -42.19%, Net loss: -1.73B. Goodyear Tire and Rubber, one of the world’s oldest and most iconic tire companies, also ranks as the third-largest tire manufacturer globally. **But competitive pressure from Chinese manufacturers' low-cost efficient production has been particularly damaging to its bottom line.** In fact, the company’s debt-laden capital structure is now marred by decades of failed corporate bureaucrats’ acquisition-driven growth plans that have merely saturated the company's balance sheet with debt and justified corporate officers' juicy pay and benefits packages. **For instance, during his final year as Chairman in 2023, former CEO Richard Kramer was paid a staggering $14.7 million while the company incurred $689 million in losses.** In contrast, Florian Menegaux, the CEO of Michelin, received a total compensation of $3.26 million in 2024. Similarly, Shuichi Ishibashi, the CEO of Bridgestone Global, earned just $1.89 million in 2024 while Bridgestone has consistently maintained its position as the largest and most profitable tire manufacturer globally. Notably, both Michelin and Bridgestone are dividend-paying stocks. **For nearly a decade, Kramer, a CPA by training, mismanaged the company while leading it to a decline in its market share, simultaneously granting himself lavish pay and benefit packages.** **In addition to Chinese entrants in the tire sector, Goodyear’s competitive edge has also been impacted by renewed pressure from its better capitalized international brands such Michelin, Sumitomo, Bridgestone, and Pirelli.** **On the positive note, Goodyear boasts a legacy brand with a leading position in a core essential service sector. The brand’s recognition as a quality tire manufacturer and its popularity among customers stem from its long-standing relationship with manufacturers since the days of Henry Ford's Model T.** **David Tepper’s Appaloosa Management’s recent stock accumulation can be seen as a vote of confidence in management turn around plan, and may even spark retail interest in the company.** [Undervalued metrics or justifiable underperformance?]( Given the company’s substantial liabilities and debt load, further debt restructuring efforts are expected. Shareholders have been sacrificed for far too long, and a turnaround strategy is crucial to improve owner equity. Mark Stewart’s $24M pay package for 2024 must therefore be \" earned\" with stockholders' capital gain. The $3B net equity on total assets of $20B input a more aggressive asset divestiture plan and renewed focus on customer satisfaction and profitability. The company’s depressed shares are therefore poised for a turnaround if corporate officers uphold their commitments in cost reduction and net income maximization. **In conclusion:** **At $8/share, the stock is fairly valued considering the current market downside volatility and the lingering effects of decade-long corporate misaligned strategy in an industry exposed to Chinese low-cost alternatives such as Zhongce rubber Group, Giti Tire, Sailun group, and the Koreans Kumho and Hankook tires.** **A turnaround is probable given the company’s legacy brand and revenues. In fact, a retail meme fervor could easily ignite a fire under the shares, pushing equities to relative highs.** **Should Goodyear ($GT) get acquired?** **Current valuation warrants serious consideration from private equity given management's strategic commitment to optimizing its portfolio, cutting down debt, and improving margins. However, the company's legacy of overpaid \" technocrats\" demands a radical approach. Basically, investors are fed up with the old \" turnaround\" tale designed to gaslight the public and secure execs' compensation package over shareholders' returns: Asset stripping, layoffs, vanity projects...At this juncture, firing the overpaid execs and truly thinning off the balance sheet fat is necessary to salvage the company's legacy.** **Overall, the stock warrants a speculative buy grade. A radical change in executive culture is necessary, warranting either an acquisition or going going-private restructuring.** **Estimated Fair Value: $12/share.** Going private estimation: $18/share.",

Do your own due diligence and contact a professional before investing . EV 10.87B trailing PE 5.12 PS 0.14 PB 0.84 profit Margin 9.44 % Ret on Equity 42.19 % Net loss 1.73B . Goodyear Tire and Rubber one of the world ’ s oldest and most iconic tire companies also ranks as the thirdlargest tire manufacturer globally . But competitive pressure from Chinese manufacturers lowcost efficient production has been particularly damaging to its bottom line . In fact the company ’ s debtladen capital structure is now marred by decades of failed corporate bureaucrats ’ acquisitiondriven growth plans that have merely saturated the companys balance sheet with debt and justified corporate officers juicy pay and benefits packages . For instance during his final year as Chairman in 2023 former CEO Richard Kramer was paid a staggering $ 14.7 million while the company incurred $ 689 million in losses . In contrast Florian Menegaux the CEO of Michelin received a total compensation of $ 3.26 million in 2024 . Similarly Shuichi Ishibashi the CEO of Bridgestone Global earned just $ 1.89 million in 2024 while Bridgestone has consistently maintained its position as the largest and most profitable tire manufacturer globally . Notably both Michelin and Bridgestone are dividendpaying stocks . For nearly a decade Kramer a CPA by training mismanaged the company while leading it to a decline in its market share simultaneously granting himself lavish pay and benefit packages . In addition to Chinese entrants in the tire sector Goodyear ’ s competitive edge has also been impacted by renewed pressure from its better capitalized international brands such Michelin Sumitomo Bridgestone and Pirelli . On the positive note Goodyear boasts a legacy brand with a leading position in a core essential service sector . The brand ’ s recognition as a quality tire manufacturer and its popularity among customers stem from its longstanding relationship with manufacturers since the days of Henry Fords Model T. David Tepper ’ s Appaloosa Management ’ s recent stock accumulation can be seen as a vote of confidence in management turn around plan and may even spark retail interest in the company . Undervalued metrics or justifiable underperformance Given the company ’ s substantial liabilities and debt load further debt restructuring efforts are expected . Shareholders have been sacrificed for far too long and a turnaround strategy is crucial to improve owner equity . Mark Stewart ’ s $ 24M pay package for 2024 must therefore be earned with stockholders capital gain . The $ 3B net equity on total assets of $ 20B input a more aggressive asset divestiture plan and renewed focus on customer satisfaction and profitability . The company ’ s depressed shares are therefore poised for a turnaround if corporate officers uphold their commitments in cost reduction and net income maximization . In conclusion At $ 8share the stock is fairly valued considering the current market downside volatility and the lingering effects of decadelong corporate misaligned strategy in an industry exposed to Chinese lowcost alternatives such as Zhongce rubber Group Giti Tire Sailun group and the Koreans Kumho and Hankook tires . A turnaround is probable given the company ’ s legacy brand and revenues . In fact a retail meme fervor could easily ignite a fire under the shares pushing equities to relative highs . Should Goodyear $ GT get acquired Current valuation warrants serious consideration from private equity given managements strategic commitment to optimizing its portfolio cutting down debt and improving margins . However the companys legacy of overpaid technocrats demands a radical approach . Basically investors are fed up with the old turnaround tale designed to gaslight the public and secure execs compensation package over shareholders returns Asset stripping layoffs vanity projects ... At this juncture firing the overpaid execs and truly thinning off the balance sheet fat is necessary to salvage the companys legacy . Overall the stock warrants a speculative buy grade . A radical change in executive culture is necessary warranting either an acquisition or going goingprivate restructuring . Estimated Fair Value $ 12share . Going private estimation $ 18share ."

A few years ago, it was everywhere, but now it seems that the standard advice is \"just ETFs, ignore the rest.\" I mostly follow this approach, but I still keep a small allocation to P2P for diversification. For me, P2P only works as: a small part of my portfolio something outside the public markets an experiment, not a core strategy I've been using one platform in the EU for some time (that's not the topic of this post, I don't want to promote anything here). The experience has been... okay. Nothing magical, nothing terrible – just another tool with its own risks and compromises. It is clear that: there is a platform risk buyback guarantees are not real guarantees it can go wrong, especially in unfavorable macroeconomic conditions This is not advice or a recommendation. I'm just interested in what the community thinks about it. So: are you still investing in P2P, or have you completely abandoned it in favor of ETFs/stocks? If anyone really wants specific information, I'll be happy to answer in the comments or DM – but I'm interested in the discussion itself. Here is printscreen of my portfolio as an example: [ [",

The last time I did a single large deposit into the market was around 2022, and within a few months the market took a downturn and it was painful to see it take several years for that money to return to the original investment value so now I am scared. In addition to that experience, I feel like I keep hearing there will be an AI bubble burst and downturn in the market. What would you all recommend? Invest 1 million now all at once or slowly? Are there funds you recommend investing in to avoid this AI bubble burst?",

The last time I did a single large deposit into the market was around 2022 and within a few months the market took a downturn and it was painful to see it take several years for that money to return to the original investment value so now I am scared . In addition to that experience I feel like I keep hearing there will be an AI bubble burst and downturn in the market . What would you all recommend Invest 1 million now all at once or slowly Are there funds you recommend investing in to avoid this AI bubble burst"

      "selftext": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared? I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House: 1. Road to Housing Act - somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren. It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA. Now the house needs to decide if it’s going to add it on their end. Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good. Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2. FOMC meeting. With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices. If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes, things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not stick thing. I don’t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it. Now, there’s a wrinkle here. We don’t have enough construction workers. So from my POV we have two solutions: 1. Lift the cap on H2B workers - which may be done temporarily via executive order, particularly if a housing emergency is declared. 2. Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses. I think Road To Housing is the key element here. It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing, small houses, and cheaper housing. It couldn’t move forward without the government reopening. The government is open and we may get our rate cut. It passed the senate, and the White House wants the house to add it. I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it’s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms. Stocks I bought (see screenshots): Builders and materials: ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured: CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving: RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren’t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck. Manufactured could be huge here, but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes. The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages, 40/50 yr mortgage ideas get put in action. If Hassett replaces JP we’ll probably get the lower rates. Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff, Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago: I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn’t have the manufactured homes builders. I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off. Not financial advice.",

      "selftext_processed": "Remember when Bessent said a housing emergency may be declared I think the government shutdown messed with the timing but now I think we have two catalysts that will make a declaration soon be smart from the White House 1 . Road to Housing Act somehow a bipartisan bill from Tim Scott and Elizabeth Warren . It passed the senate and is attached to the NDAA . Now the house needs to decide if it ’ s going to add it on their end . Road to Housing is huge and if it passes alone makes my trade good . Ask AI to explain it to you and what it does for housing stocks 2 . FOMC meeting . With 2.5 days to go until a decision it would be dumb to introduce anything that could be construed as inflationary towards home prices . If the rate cut hits and Road to Housing passes things are a lot easier for the executive to do their whole declare stuff that may or may not_stick thing . I don ’ t fully think materials tariffs will be lowered but Bessent did talk about it . Now there ’ s a wrinkle here . We don ’ t have enough construction workers . So from my POV we have two solutions 1 . Lift the cap on H2B workers which may be done temporarily via executive order particularly if a housing emergency is declared . 2 . Road to Housing act incentivizes localities to relax zoning for manufactured houses . I think Road To Housing is the key element here . It provides a ton of benefits to manufactured housing small houses and cheaper housing . It couldn ’ t move forward without the government reopening . The government is open and we may get our rate cut . It passed the senate and the White House wants the house to add it . I think this ends up being a path of political survival now that it ’ s clear affordability is what will be driving voters at midterms . Stocks I bought see screenshots Builders and materials ITB QXO DHI LGIH Manufactured CVCO SKY UMH ELS More People Buying and Moving RKT Z COMP I think materials and most builders aren ’ t ideal for this because the workers shortage is a real bottleneck . Manufactured could be huge here but DHI and LGIH sell a lot of starter homes . The RKT Z COMP stocks do best if rates fall and if the portable mortgages 4050 yr mortgage ideas get put in action . If Hassett replaces JP we ’ ll probably get the lower rates . Unrelated to all the policy and rate specific stuff Cathie Wood oddly referenced housing as a good trade 2 days ago I deleted my last DD on this because it was too heavy on materials and didn ’ t have the manufactured homes builders . I still want to get this up so I can feel good about having told everyone before it all goes off . Not_financial advice ."

      "selftext": "Hi all - I bought 160 shares of Palantir in late 2024 in a smaller account. I studied the company and watched the stock like crazy before I invested, but I should’ve bought more. Some were purchased at $31 and some were purchased at $43. I let my dad sometimes manage one of my accounts, a smaller, diversified portfolio, as he has done really well in the stock market. I’ve was pregnant this past year and not looking at my accounts as I didn’t want to make any rash decisions (pregnancy hormones). He asked me in May 2025 if I would think about selling some shares since I made a good profit and he thought palantir’s rapid growth was unsustainable. I told him he could sell 10 shares, but I’d really prefer him not to. In June 2025 I told him, I hope you didn’t sell any palantir, and he replied “you’re good.” I found out last week after I got back on my account for the first time that he sold 160 shares, 60 at $121.02 in May 2025 and 80 shares at $158.65 in August 2025. He didn’t tell me about this, and I didn’t see the emails or check my account so I didn’t find out until last week. Usually I manage my account weekly. Now I only have 20 shares left. In my dads defense, he has made me a lot of money on stocks, so while I am angry at him, he always tells me before he buys and sells and I do the bulk of the trading. My stock advisor only manages big funds and not individual stocks, so he doesn’t place any trades for me. I am wondering if I should buy back Palantir, at least 30 shares, as its growth is expected to continue to skyrocket. I know its trading at $181 but have no problem putting a couple thousand into it.",

      "selftext": "I posted this on Friday predicting SP inclusion, but the mods deleted it. Anyway… I’ve been studying/trading Carvana for many years. The key to survival has been understanding that the CVNA CEO and his father (who owns nearly 40% of the diluted share count an sits at #42 in the Forbes list) are evil, but extremely clever. They have manipulated both the share price as well as the company’s financials by controlling the float and establishing 4 quarters of profitability via related party transactions. Their end goal was always SP inclusion, which now creates continuous liquidity to turn back on the 10b5-1 trading plan and unload on passive buyers. Due to the conditions that enabled the above, this ain’t a gap up, it’s a supply crisis. Institutions currently own 90-95% of the tradeable float. The actual loose float available is only 10-15 million shares. Tomorrow morning three big buyers are hitting a wall of zero supply: - Short interest is still ~12M shares. Many are facing a margin call at the open and must buy to cover. - MM were selling calls all week on the rumor. With the AH gap to $440, thousands of Dec 19 contracts just went Deep ITM. MM need to buy 2.5M - 3M shares to stay delta neutral. - The SP500 index funds need to buy roughly 16 million shares (approx. $7B) by Dec 19. They can't buy yet, so arb desks will be buying Monday to warehousefor them. The level of greed is on mars right now because every trading desk is aware of the mechanics and liquidity crunch. Institutions are holding because they know indexes will pay whatever it takes on Dec 18. Buying demand far outweighs supply. It’s hard to say how exactly this plays out, but this is stock is crazy and this event is extremely unique. If I had to guess, CVNA gaps up 15%+ and has the potential to rip higher. I’m expecting a high in the 470-500 range. Absurd, I know, but this is the grand finale of one of the greatest marker manipulations in history. It’ll be fun to watch tomorrow.",

      "selftext": "Buying VOO and shorting a few stocks is not for me. As the Mag 7 combined are now ~ 35% of S&P500, VOO has become a less diversified investment. As a principle, I don’t like concentration. TSLA ’s valuation in particular is an outlier. Buying VOO and shorting TSLA (or any other) requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent. What if I just don’t own it? I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of S&P493 ( it excludes the Mag 7). Fees are 0.35% so quite more than VOO 0.03% but lower than direct indexing, has no minimum and no headache of transferring assets to another brokerage. It rebalances quarterly. I see one drawback, it’s new and relatively small (67M in assets! ) The bid & ask spread yesterday was a few cents (17 bps). It’s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stock(s).",

As a principle I don ’ t like concentration . TSLA ’ s valuation in particular is an outlier . Buying VOO and shorting TSLA or any other requires margin and the market could stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent . What if I just don ’ t own it I found XMAG is an ETF with full replication of SP493 it excludes the Mag 7 . Fees are 0.35 % so quite more than VOO 0.03 % but lower than direct indexing has no_minimum and no_headache of transferring assets to another brokerage . It rebalances quarterly . I see one drawback it ’ s new and relatively small 67M in assets The bid ask spread yesterday was a few cents 17 bps . It ’ s pretty simple to add any of the Mag7 by adding individual stocks ."

      "selftext": "My grandfather retired in 1998 at 48 years old(around when I was born to help out), he had about $75k in an IRA and a pension that covered most of his expenses. He currently has $170k in a Roth IRA. Since then he’s invested only in stocks (no bonds or ETFs), he mostly did short term trades until 5-7 years ago he started long term investing. The last 20 years he withdrew between $15-25k a year to help cover expenses. He’s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know. It helped set me on a really solid path, but I never actually knew how well he did and he never tracked it. But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says, he’s old now and literally didn’t know it had that feature. So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2%, the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA. But I got it down to 10.7% annualized over 27 years. I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02%, but the nasdaq (which is his preferred benchmark) is 11-12% I couldn’t get an exact number easily. So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq. I’d argue he did much better than he likely would have with an advisor (after fees) or even just following the normal 80/20 recommendation. So I think his performance is good. However, I don’t think it was great and likely when risk adjusted significantly underperformed. Curious what others think as everyone here always says “well good luck maintaining that for 30 years” and I never see realistic posts of people’s 30 year return so I figured I’d share a real life example.",

The last 20 years he withdrew between $ 1525k a year to help cover expenses . He ’ s always talked to me about investing and taught me maybe half of what I know . It helped set me on a really solid path but I never_actually knew how well he did and he never_tracked it . But yesterday I finally grew the balls to ask to check his Fidelity account and look at what its performance tracker says he ’ s old now and literally didn ’ t know it had that feature . So over the last 10 years he had annualized returns of 14.2 % the first couple years were a bit harder to gauge since he moved everything from a trad ira to a Roth IRA . But I got it down to 10.7 % annualized over 27 years . I see sp500 over that time annualized 9.02 % but the nasdaq which is his preferred benchmark is 1112 % I couldn ’ t get an exact number easily . So he outperformed the sp500 but underperformed the nasdaq .

Using Zacks.com’s stock screener, I downloaded all public stocks with: (1) a market cap above $100 billion, (2) an operating margin above 0%, and (3) a sales growth forecast above 0%. This screen gave me 118 stocks (including the Class B shares for GOOG/L). I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars: [Growth Profit Matrix]( With no surprise, the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region. PLTR, HOOD, LLY and TSM also made the cut. MA, APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks. For my Value Points calculation, I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 (above the blue line). This could include Stars, Cash Cows and Question Marks. Once I’ve identified the good companies, the next step, of course, is to determine whether they currently are overvalued, undervalued or appropriately priced. We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks.",

      "selftext_processed": "With apologies to BCGs Growth Share Matrix I present my version for evaluating public stocks . Using Zacks.com ’ s stock screener I downloaded all public stocks with 1 a market cap above $ 100 billion 2 an operating margin above 0 % and 3 a sales growth forecast above 0 % . This screen gave me 118 stocks including the Class B shares for GOOGL . I then put those stocks in a scatter plot to identify the Stars Growth Profit Matrix With no_surprise the semiconductor stocks NVDA and AVGO were the furthest into the Star region . PLTR HOOD LLY and TSM also made the cut . MA APP and V are examples of high operating margin but lower revenue growth stocks . For my Value Points calculation I like stocks that have a combined operating margin and projected revenue growth of at least 40 above the blue line . This could include Stars Cash Cows and Question Marks . Once I ’ ve identified the good companies the next step of course is to determine whether they currently are overvalued undervalued or appropriately priced . We will run that analysis on individual stocks over the coming weeks ."

      "selftext": "I’m 23 years old. I’ve been in the workforce for 1 year after finishing my degree and I don’t have a good job or a career yet. I’ve recently inherited a little over $1,000,000 AUD. I know there are reasons Australians have to buy a house. The first is you don't have to pay capital gains tax when you sell your Principal Place of Residence (PPOR). The second is that it's the easiest way for a normal person to get access to affordable leverage. Finally, it's a great forced savings mechanism for people without the discipline to save. On the other hand, I feel like most Australian property investors are very emotional about their investments. They see the good performance over the last couple of decades and believe that that tells them anything about the future performance of the asset class. There's also the status associated with owning a home and FOMO about being priced out of owning a home that influences them to buy. Needless to say, emotional investments have rarely made for good investments historically. Stocks seem attractive to me because of the 50 percent CGT discount for long-term holders. If you sell it slowly in retirement you can avoid paying CGT just as with a PPOR. Furthermore, while price to rental yields make purchasing property expensive in Australia right now, stocks don't have this same issue. US stocks are expensive. The average PE ratio is extraordinarily high compared to the past. The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future. Emerging market stocks are not, however. The PE ratios are low, and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic. They have done poorly the past 2 decades, after all. Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no signs of slowing down. People there are industrious, educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent, entitled, and lazy. So what I'm saying here is that EM stocks, to my eye, are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive. Is there some argument for Australian property I'm not seeing here? Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead?",

Theres also the status associated with owning a home and FOMO about being priced out of owning a home that influences them to buy . Needless to say emotional investments have rarely made for good investments historically . Stocks seem attractive to me because of the 50 percent CGT discount for longterm holders . If you sell it slowly in retirement you can avoid paying CGT just as with a PPOR . Furthermore while price to rental yields make purchasing property expensive in Australia right now stocks dont have this same issue . US stocks are expensive . The average PE ratio is extraordinarily high compared to the past . The current preference of Australian investors to overweight US stocks is probably in part due to the common fallacy of investors to look at past exceptional performance to extrapolate exceptional performance in the future . Emerging market stocks are not_however . The PE ratios are low and sentiment around EM stocks is pessimistic . They have done poorly the past 2 decades after all . Meanwhile developing countries particularly in Asia seem to be making progress modernising and see no_signs of slowing down . People there are industrious educated and intelligent while Westerners doing the same jobs are often complacent entitled and lazy . So what Im saying here is that EM stocks to my eye are cheap and are a solid bet and that Australian property is overrated and expensive . Is there some argument for Australian property Im not_seeing here Do the tax benefits of owning AU property trump any potential future outperformance of owning EM stocks instead"

      "selftext": "I was born in 1998. My generation hasn’t experienced a serious market drawdown in our adult lifetime. Every asset class has gone up consistently, fueled by massive central bank stimulus quantitative easing (QE) that began in 2008. I can’t help but wonder how brutal the next real crash might be, especially considering that most of us born around the same time and now working in finance with real responsibilities have never lived through one. We just dont know what real f*cking market fear is. The new “truth” seems to be that a 10% annual return in the stock market is guaranteed, and that the risk free rate despite now yielding about the same as the S&P 500 earnings yield is for fools. I feel like freaking Gandalf, sitting in Minas Tirith, reading ancient scrolls about the ring that once existed, that no one believes could return. Except in this case, it’s “stocks can actually fall for long periods”. There was a time when stocks were considered risky, and people understood that. Now I hear friends talk about mutual funds like they’re savings accounts: “10% returns, locked in.” And since we’ve never seen anything close to a long lasting market drawdown with real fear, I can’t even imagine how badly people will panic. Just a few weeks ago, people were already calling for the Fed to step in when the S&P was still at 5000. God, when I look at my friends and our generation, I can’t stand that the only thing left is to hope we actually get a lesson. There’s an ATH of fools running around thinking they’re f*cking George Soros on Main Street. We need a 1929 event, and we need it now. I don’t care if I have to live in a tent",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m planning to start investing more consistently and could use some perspective from people with more experience. My plan is to invest around €500 every few months, with a long-term horizon (10+ years). I’m not looking for quick gains, mainly preservation of value with a reasonable long-term return. I’ve been considering a few options: Physical gold, but many people say it’s not the best idea right now since it’s at an all-time high. An S&P 500 ETF, but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “too high” to enter. Some Asian/emerging markets ETFs, but opinions on those are mixed as well. So now I’m a bit stuck, it feels like everything is “not a good idea right now,” which doesn’t make sense if I want to invest regularly. Given today’s market conditions, what would you consider a sensible long-term investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not trying to time the market? All advice and perspectives are welcome.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ m planning to start investing more consistently and could use some perspective from people with more experience . My plan is to invest around €500 every few months with a longterm horizon 10 years . I ’ m not_looking for quick gains mainly preservation of value with a reasonable longterm return . I ’ ve been considering a few options Physical gold but many people say it ’ s not_the best idea right now since it ’ s at an alltime high . An SP 500 ETF but I also keep seeing comments that the index is currently “ too high ” to enter . Some Asianemerging markets ETFs but opinions on those are mixed as well . So now I ’ m a bit stuck it feels like everything is “ not a good idea right now ” which doesn ’ t make sense if I want to invest regularly . Given today ’ s market conditions what would you consider a sensible longterm investment strategy for someone contributing periodically and not_trying to time the market All advice and perspectives are welcome ."

      "selftext": "I’m reviewing research for the 2026–2030 cycle that suggests we are entering a period of sticky inflation driven by tariffs and deficits, alongside a weakening labor market that headline GDP isn't capturing. The argument is that standard nominal bonds will fail to protect purchasing power if the Fed cuts rates to support the economy while inflation remains above target. Is there a prudent case for tilting towards Small Cap Value, Gold, and Managed Futures to hedge this specific environment, or is this just unnecessary complexity compared to a standard total market approach?",

The argument is that standard nominal bonds will fail to protect purchasing power if the Fed cuts rates to support the economy while inflation remains above target . Is there a prudent case for tilting towards Small Cap Value Gold and Managed Futures to hedge this specific environment or is this just unnecessary complexity compared to a standard total market approach"

My brain considers investing as an almost 10% guarantee over a 40 year timespan when I retire, with volatility being ironed out by time in the market, but when you apply that to any of the top individual companies, that 10% annual return gives valuations that my brain can’t comprehend and interprets as ludicrous. Could we really see companies like Apple or Microsoft (or some other company that might take over in the future) or whoever else being valued at 30 trillion in 40 years time? Or is the stock market hitting some unknown limit of size? I believe the stock market will grow more, but when you consider that growth being driven by companies being valued at 10s of trillions, it all seems impossible!",

      "selftext": "I’ve twice previously posted on Verticals valuation; this time I want to focus on their quality. If you go to the investors section of Verticals website, you’ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions. I’m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles. Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency. The European equivalent of the FAA. Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household, acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords. This following a long career at MI5 (UK equivalent of FBI) where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General. Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025. He was previously the CEO of ATP, Denmark’s national pension plan. These three people have a couple of things in common. First and chief among them is integrity. These are people whose lives are built upon it. The second is that they are not short of options, and yet Dómhnal Slattery, an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board. One final thought, how would the market react if the former head of the FAA, the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers? Massive thanks to Prof G for the “Heads Up”. Adam",

If you go to the investors section of Verticals website you ’ ll see many individuals with impressive resumes who are all familiar with senior positions . I ’ m just going to focus briefly on 3 of the most recent recruits and their most pertinent previous roles . Patrick Ky joined Verticals board at the beginning of September 2025 following 10 years as Executive Director of The European Aviation Safety Agency . The European equivalent of the FAA . Lord Andrew Parker joined the board in June 2025 after serving as Lord Chamberlain of the Royal Household acting as the main channel of communication between the monarch and the House of Lords . This following a long career at MI5 UK equivalent of FBI where from 2013 to 2020 he served as Director General . Carsten Stendevad joined in May 2025 . He was previously the CEO of ATP Denmark ’ s national pension plan . These three people have a couple of things in common . First and chief among them is integrity . These are people whose lives are built upon it . The second is that they are not_short of options and yet Dómhnal Slattery an aerospace entrepreneur with almost 40 years ’ experience was able to cherry pick them for his board . One final thought how would the market react if the former head of the FAA the former head of the FBI and the former head of say The Federal Reserve were to join the board of one of Verticals peers Massive thanks to Prof G for the “ Heads Up ” .

I have made around 4k over 2025 by doing it and learning more with it. My question is would it be smarter for me to just be investing my money into a roth ira at this age and letting it build over time or just keep doing what i’m doing and push for an earlier retirement through a taxable account, i contribute about 10-12k a year into my taxable account and the amount i’ll invest each year will go up as I get older",

      "title": "Robinhood froze my ~$160k account 18+ months ago after misreading a police email",
      "selftext": "I’m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don’t want it tied back to my main. About a year and a half ago my ex, who was very abusive, filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her. I’m in Texas, so the cops went all in. They arrested me, searched my house, took all my electronics and paperwork, and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them. The only “drugs” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college, and I had receipts for everything. Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no THC. I was never charged with anything. They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture, so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it. That case is now over. All my property has been returned and there are no charges and no open criminal cases against me. During the investigation, one cop sent a generic “this person is under investigation” email to all my banks and to Robinhood. It was not a court order, not a levy, nothing that said “freeze this account.” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it. Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account. The account is around 160k, mostly in three big stocks I’ve held since the COVID crash. Since then, the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no hold, no lien, no legal freeze, and that they don’t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all. They’ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn’t. Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now. Every time I contact support, I get the same copy-paste answer about “our team is reviewing this, we can’t give a timeline.” I’ve filed complaints with regulators. The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he’s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never any freeze or lien, but he doesn’t really know Robinhood/FINRA stuff and I don’t have money for a second lawyer. Meanwhile I’m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked. Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there’s no court order, no lien, and no seizure according to the city attorney and police, or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win? What legal steps, if any, actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “under review” response? For the hearing on the 15th, I don’t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never any freeze or lien and nothing on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds. I’ve also wondered if it’s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “release” email when the police are saying there was never a freeze in the first place. If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit, I’d like to know whether there’s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it’s caused, or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened. And I’d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of Robinhood/FINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they’re doing.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m posting from a throwaway because this whole thing has been a nightmare and I don ’ t want it tied back to my main . About a year and a half ago my ex who was very abusive filed an online report saying I was selling weed after I finally left her . I ’ m in Texas so the cops went all in . They arrested me searched my house took all my electronics and paperwork and even towed both of my cars and ripped through them . The only “ drugs ” they found were legal CBD gummies and a couple of CBD drinks I bought from a shop by a college and I had receipts for everything . Their own field test and then the lab both came back with no_THC . I was never_charged with anything . They still tried to take my stuff using civil forfeiture so I hired a lawyer and spent around 50k fighting it . That case is now over . All my property has been returned and there are no_charges and no_open criminal cases against me . During the investigation one cop sent a generic “ this person is under investigation ” email to all my banks and to Robinhood . It was not_a court order not_a levy nothing_that said “ freeze this account. ” All of my banks and credit card companies ignored it . Only Robinhood decided to lock my brokerage account . The account is around 160k mostly in three big stocks I ’ ve held since the COVID crash . Since then the police and the city attorney have put in writing that there is no_hold no_lien no_legal freeze and that they don ’ t plan to go after my Robinhood funds at all . They ’ ve looked at the original email and basically said Robinhood misread it and treated it like something it isn ’ t . Robinhood has kept the account frozen for more than 18 months now . Every time I contact support I get the same copypaste answer about “ our team is reviewing this we can ’ t give a timeline. ” I ’ ve filed complaints with regulators . The lawyer who handled the forfeiture case has a hearing on the 15th where he ’ s going to ask a judge to officially say there was never_any freeze or lien but he doesn ’ t really know RobinhoodFINRA stuff and I don ’ t have money for a second lawyer . Meanwhile I ’ m sitting on credit card debt and money I owe family while my savings are locked . Can Robinhood legally keep my account frozen this long when there ’ s no_court order no_lien and no_seizure according to the city attorney and police or is this something I can realistically take to arbitration or court and expect to win What legal steps if any actually exist to force them to act instead of just sending the same “ under review ” response For the hearing on the 15th I don ’ t even know what my lawyer should be asking the judge for beyond some kind of order clearly saying there was never_any freeze or lien and nothing_on the government side stopping Robinhood from releasing my funds . I ’ ve also wondered if it ’ s even possible for a judge to order the police or city to send some kind of “ release ” email when the police are saying there was never_a freeze in the first place . If I do end up in arbitration or a lawsuit I ’ d like to know whether there ’ s any realistic chance of getting extra damages for how long this has gone on and the financial mess it ’ s caused or if it usually just ends with the account finally being opened . And I ’ d really appreciate guidance on what type of lawyer actually handles this kind of RobinhoodFINRA situation and how to find one who knows what they ’ re doing ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 23 years old, earning €1,500 per month. I’ve been investing €235 monthly for the last 4 months. My goal is to keep this amount until I build a savings buffer that I personally feel comfortable with, and then increase my monthly contributions. For context, I already have an emergency fund equal to 6 months of my salary. My current portfolio allocation is: • 85% VWCE • 15% IBIT I want to keep at least 5% IBIT long-term, and I want VWCE to remain my core holding. However, since I’m still young, I’m considering adding a technology ETF or possibly a semiconductor ETF for higher growth potential. If you have a better strategy in mind that fits my profile, feel free to suggest it. Additional info: • My country has no capital gains tax on stocks/ETFs. • I’m currently investing through Trading212, but I plan to move to IBKR once my portfolio reaches a certain size. All opinions and advice are welcome.",

For context I already have an emergency fund equal to 6 months of my salary . My current portfolio allocation is • 85 % VWCE • 15 % IBIT I want to keep at least 5 % IBIT longterm and I want VWCE to remain my core holding . However since I ’ m still young I ’ m considering adding a technology ETF or possibly a semiconductor ETF for higher growth potential . If you have a better strategy in mind that fits my profile feel free to suggest it .

      "selftext": "I have spent the last year working on tools that helps investors do research quickly and understand their own portfolios. Here's some observations on what people say they'll do and what they actually do when the markets get choppy or goes sideways. 1. **The \"I'll buy the dip\" crowd that never does** Everyone has a plan until the markets drop 10%. Then suddenly that cash on the sidelines stay on the sidelines. Even worse is that some sell at the bottom and convince that they will get back in when everything stabilize. They rarely do. The investors who actually benefit from volatility are the ones who automate their buying or have rules they stick to **2. Checking Portfolios way too often** There is some good research on this already and some of you may already aware of it, but watching it in practice is something else. The folks who check daily usually tend to make more changes. More changes usually means worse returns. The one's who check monthly or quarterly tend to be better at riding out the noise and end up better off. **3. Confusing narrative with strategy** \"AI is the future\" is NOT a portfolio strategy. Neither is \"The dollar is collapsing\" or \"real estate always goes up\" or something is a bubble etc. The investors that actually do well tend to have actual rules for allocation, percentages, a thesis, exit strategy etc. The ones chasing themes tend to buy high, panic sell at lows and end up worse than they'd just held a boring index fund. None of this is new, but seeing it play out at our analysis repeatedly made it real in a way that reading about it never did. What behavioral traps have you caught yourself falling into ?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been taking time off work and during the break I’ve been trying to understand money and investing a bit more deeply, beyond the usual “buy stocks, buy index funds” talking points. Something I keep coming back to is the way interest rates and markets interact. We’re living in a time where interest rates are generally quite low (with some spikes here and there recently), and inflation is mostly kept under control. But if you look back a few decades, high interest rates (double digits) weren’t unusual at all. It made me wonder: are low rates simply the new normal because of how modern economies are structured? Or is this just another phase in a longer cycle? And when interest rates stay low, the money tends to flow into equities and indexes like the S&P 500. Over long stretches, the S&P has massively outperformed other investment avenues from GIC/Precious Metals/Bank Savings, depending on the timeframe you choose. I’m trying to understand if that’s purely because of real economic growth and innovation, or if low rates artificially push valuations up. I’m definitely not saying the S&P is a Ponzi (it clearly represents real companies), but the way it keeps going up almost nonstop made me wonder if there’s a point where the growth stalls, like for ex, what happened to Japan’s Nikkei after its massive boom. So my question is basically: Is the long-term rise of the S&P 500 mostly driven by productivity and innovation, or by monetary policy and liquidity? And if the latter, what happens when liquidity can’t expand forever? Could we ever see a long sideways/down market like Japan, or are the situations too different to compare? I’m just trying to understand how money actually works in the big picture, so any explanation or reading material would be appreciated.",

Something I keep coming back to is the way interest rates and markets interact . We ’ re living in a time where interest rates are generally quite low with some spikes here and there recently and inflation is mostly kept under control . But if you look back a few decades high interest rates double digits weren ’ t unusual at all . It made me wonder are low rates simply the new normal because of how modern economies are structured Or is this just another phase in a longer cycle And when interest rates stay low the money tends to flow into equities and indexes like the SP 500 . Over long stretches the SP has massively outperformed other investment avenues from GICPrecious MetalsBank Savings depending on the timeframe you choose . I ’ m trying to understand if that ’ s purely because of real economic growth and innovation or if low rates artificially push valuations up . I ’ m definitely not_saying the SP is a Ponzi it clearly represents real companies but the way it keeps going up almost nonstop made me wonder if there ’ s a point where the growth stalls like for ex what happened to Japan ’ s Nikkei after its massive boom . So my question is basically Is the longterm rise of the SP 500 mostly driven by productivity and innovation or by monetary policy and liquidity And if the latter what happens when liquidity can ’ t expand forever Could we ever see a long sidewaysdown market like Japan or are the situations too different to compare I ’ m just trying to understand how money actually works in the big picture so any explanation or reading material would be appreciated ."

      "selftext": "In the history of human economic relations, wealth and power have always had only two sources: a) you hold a resource others depend on; b) you hold an instrument of someone's obligation (others owe you) Whoever holds the key to someone else’s dependence is free. Whoever depends on others is a slave. Quite simple. If you hold oil, grain, or electricity, people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles, feed themselves, or heat their homes and factories. Without that resource, their normal functioning stops. If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not enough housing, individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price, often handing over a large part of their income for decades. Without access to an apartment, they cannot normally live and work in that city. If you hold supermarket gift cards, airline \"miles,\" casino chips, or shares in a company, the issuers owe you goods, services, cash, dividends, or liquidation proceeds. If you hold dollars or euros, bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory, and the state will be unable to pay its bonds. This is because that money is created through bank loans. Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house. Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory. Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy. That is why millions of people work, sell, and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans. You, who hold that money, don't have to do anything. Others work for you. In all these examples, you possess leverage over others: people must come to you, beg you, work for you, or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations. Bitcoin gives you none of that. It gives you neither a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends (as with energy, housing, or dollars). There is no issuer who owes you anything (as with stocks, casino chips, or gift cards). In short, Bitcoin does not give you control over others. Instead, it gives you control over a number in a shared database. To obtain that \"number,\" you had to give up things that gave you real power: other people's obligations, other people's dependence, other people's fear of being left without what you control. The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin, you traded leverage for emptiness. You no longer have anything that others depend on. All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number. In other words: before, others had to come to you; now you have to beg them. Before, you held an instrument that was someone else's obligation or the key to their functioning. Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no one to anything. You gave up power and received pure dependence. That is why all the talk of \"digital gold,\" \"sovereignty,\" and \"financial freedom\" is just a marketing trick. True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you, when you hold something without which they cannot function or something that obliges them to do something for you. With Bitcoin it is the opposite: you are the one who depends on other people's acceptance, on other people's will. That is not liberation; it is a voluntary entry into slavery.",

Whoever depends on others is a slave . Quite simple . If you hold oil grain or electricity people and companies must come to you and pay you to drive their vehicles feed themselves or heat their homes and factories . Without that resource their normal functioning stops . If you hold most apartments in a city where there is not_enough housing individuals and families must pay you rent or the purchase price often handing over a large part of their income for decades . Without access to an apartment they can not normally live and work in that city . If you hold supermarket gift cards airline miles casino chips or shares in a company the issuers owe you goods services cash dividends or liquidation proceeds . If you hold dollars or euros bank debtors must come to you or they will lose their house or factory and the state will be unable to pay its bonds . This is because that money is created through bank loans . Every person with a mortgage must bring that money to the bank to get the lien removed from their house . Every company with a loan must bring it to get the lien removed from its factory . Every state with bonds must bring it to avoid bankruptcy . That is why millions of people work sell and beg just to obtain those same dollars or euros and close their loans . You who hold that money dont have to do anything . Others work for you . In all these examples you possess leverage over others people must come to you beg you work for you or bring you something to get what they need or to get rid of their obligations . Bitcoin gives you none of that . It gives you neither_a physical nor a systemic resource on which the functioning of others depends as with energy housing or dollars . There is no_issuer who owes you anything as with stocks casino chips or gift cards . In short Bitcoin does not_give you control over others . Instead it gives you control over a number in a shared database . To obtain that number you had to give up things that gave you real power other peoples obligations other peoples dependence other peoples fear of being left without what you control . The moment you traded that power for Bitcoin you traded leverage for emptiness . You no_longer have anything that others depend on . All that remains is the naked hope that the market will voluntarily accept your number . In other words before others had to come to you now you have to beg them . Before you held an instrument that was someone elses obligation or the key to their functioning . Now you have thrown it away and are left with a number that obliges no_one to anything . You gave up power and received pure dependence . That is why all the talk of digital gold sovereignty and financial freedom is just a marketing trick . True freedom and sovereignty exist only when others depend on you when you hold something without which they can not function or something that obliges them to do something for you . With Bitcoin it is the opposite you are the one who depends on other peoples acceptance on other peoples will . That is not_liberation it is a voluntary entry into slavery ."

It really works so I was wondering if anyone in here did/does it? I plan on using NTSX as my base. At its core, return stacking is the idea of layering one investment return on top of another to achieve more than $1.00 of exposure for every $1.00 invested. This is typically done to maintain core portfolio exposure (like stocks and bonds) while simultaneously introducing new, diversifying return streams (like managed futures or other alternative strategies).",

There ’ s not_much on YouTube other than the main company trying to push it It really works so I was wondering if anyone in here diddoes it I plan on using NTSX as my base . At its core return stacking is the idea of layering one investment return on top of another to achieve more than $ 1.00 of exposure for every $ 1.00 invested . This is typically done to maintain core portfolio exposure like stocks and bonds while simultaneously introducing new diversifying return streams like managed futures or other alternative strategies ."

      "selftext": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never touch it, even more specifically the S&P 500 as it has outperformed 90% of all individual stocks in about 85% of all hedge funds and 75% of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor. This is why the S&P 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes, period. While all of this may be true, there is something that still needs to be considered: When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007, it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing is wrong and just keep passively investing. The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive, however, there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous. The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max, the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50% or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50% decline, The US dollar will devalue dramatically. In this current predicament, I would not say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging. If you were to buy in 2007 or pre- Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25-year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the S&P 500. And for the Great depression, it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even. So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 20-40 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years. This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on. According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader, it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not 9 months, but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds, not US bonds for reasons I can discuss later, as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession. So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions. After a substantial decline my goal is buy at -20%, then -35% then near -50% is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession. Please do not be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term. PS. My average annualized percent gain is 50%. Try getting that in an index fund",

      "selftext_processed": "The general Financial wisdom is to invest in index funds and never_touch it even more specifically the SP 500 as it has outperformed 90 % of all individual stocks in about 85 % of all hedge funds and 75 % of all asset classes including creating your own business which requires your own work and labor . This is why the SP 500 is the absolute golden standard for all investments and asset classes period . While all of this may be true there is something that still needs to be considered When the market valuations are reaching levels of pre Great depression and levels of peak 2007 it is foolish to sit there and pretend like nothing_is wrong and just keep passively investing . The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent . That is true and generally speaking with that strategy you should just keep investing when the market is expensive however there is a point where expensive becomes ludicrous . The markets are at the ludicrous level and although they might keep pushing up for another 6 months to 2 years at Max the coming recession is seeming to be a everything bubble and will likely drop markets by 50 % or more and if the government and the Federal reserve try to prevent a 50 % decline The US dollar will devalue dramatically . In this current predicament I would not_say that it is wise to ignore the ludicrous levels of the market and just keep dollar cost averaging . If you were to buy in 2007 or pre Great depression you would have been sitting on a almost 20 to 25year wait to break even inflation adjusted with the SP 500 . And for the Great depression it was somewhere around 40 to 50 years just to break even . So in essence you are saying that you are willing to take the risk of 2040 years waiting for the reward of at most 2 years . This is completely insane and is putting your head in the ground ignoring what is going on . According to all the data and statistics that I have seen as a stock trader it seems that the market is indeed likely to keep going higher for at least 3 months if not_9 months but somewhere around the 6 to 9 months from now is a very strong sell signal and I would recommend selling everything and swapping into foreign bonds not_US bonds for reasons I can discuss later as well as gold but keeping in mind that gold does start to drop about mid recession . So when the recession begins you want to sell your gold as it is up and then have the rest of your money and bonds or short positions . After a substantial decline my goal is buy at 20 % then 35 % then near 50 % is when you can allocate your capital to great growth companies that will have large returns after the recession . Please do not_be foolish and ignore the obvious economic and Market signals that are flashing danger for the long term . PS . My average annualized percent gain is 50 % . Try getting that in an index fund"

The other 2 RAM companies, Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 1/3rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely. The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can’t meet expectations, thus not making profits, causing the bubble to pop, or the market crash. But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware. If the crash occurs, how would their stocks drop, if they are making profits by selling hardware? Note: I’m a fairly new investor, so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation. Please feel free to correct me!",

The other 2 RAM companies Samsung an SK Hyinx will also profit as a whole 13rd of their competition in the consumer RAM market disappears completely . The AI Bubble popping would be because AI companies can ’ t meet expectations thus not_making profits causing the bubble to pop or the market crash . But these RAM providers ARE meeting expectations by selling the hardware . If the crash occurs how would their stocks drop if they are making profits by selling hardware Note I ’ m a fairly new investor so I may be way off the mark with this evaluation .

      "selftext": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else, but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company’s conception. Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000: \"Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google. So we had the ultimate search engine, it would understand everything on the web; it would understand, um, you know, exactly what you wanted, and it would give you the right thing. And that's obviously artificial intelligence.\"[ Google Co-Founder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI (2000)]( \\- For those that don’t know, it was supposedly Larry Page’s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI. # Full-stack AI Now, imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation. Your first thought will probably be: Which should I pick? ChatGPT immediately comes to mind, but you want to do your research properly. Through your research, you find that Google's Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck, at least among American AI models. Plus, they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model. Perfect. Google seems like a good choice. Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity (especially if they improve). But what about implementation? Google offers enterprise-ready API:s via Vertex with more features coming like auth, database and payments, Google Cloud for storage, and now even at location TPU:s that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible. Super. Suddenly, your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google, and along the way, you never touch an Nvidia product. But before you make your final decision, you ask yourself: Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term, so I don’t get vendor-locked with an inferior offering? I’ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never want to bet against the man - and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way. I don’t imagine Nvidia is particularly - or really at all - threatened by Google in the short term, though Google's TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices, reducing profit margin. Apparently, OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it, according to[ Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis]( worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia. Though what is actually important is not the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future. # AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed[ AlphaEvolve: A Gemini-powered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms]( The evolutionary AI system had, in secret, improved everything from the training of their AI models to Google's hardware, i.e., their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multi-billion dollar deal for them, with Meta considering the same. The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro, not even Gemini 2.5. Today, it’s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations, and in the future, it will use far more powerful models than that. Meaning that the better Google’s AI models get, the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google’s models and hardware. The cheaper and better Google’s hardware, the more powerful models can be built and run. The more powerful the models, the better the hardware. And so on. Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia’s CUDA moat. One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code, causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA. But once AI models become sufficiently advanced, the programming difficulty may not be a concern, or Google and Gemini create some CUDA-variant of their own. Rumors also exist of them doing just that. # All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business, it’s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia. If they do it often enough, AI labs will eventually wonder: can you build better AI models without Nvidia? This will be especially true if other AI-labs do it too:[ “resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs”]( Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for? Not at all, as I said, I've spent enough time studying Jensen that I'd never want to bet against him. After all, he is a man who roommated with a 17-year-old ex-con covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5-trillion-dollar man. Jensen has a ton of cards to play, and he’s already playing them perfectly. Nvidia still has a hardware/hardware-software lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future. If they make a substantial compute leap, Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia’s AI lab, absorb one of the AI labs, or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race. He is securing long-term deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia. Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development. He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem. Nvidia will likely begin to offer full-stack solutions of its own. And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia, Google and AMD. **Disclaimer:** I hold a significant long position in Google (Alphabet). The views expressed in this post are for educational purposes only and are my personal opinions and predictions regarding the AI landscape and do not constitute financial or investment advice. Please conduct your own due diligence before making any investment decisions. **TLDR;** Google is unlikely to pose a large threat to Nvidia in the short term, though the perceived threat might force Nvidia to decrease their profit margin. But over the long term, Google’s full stack offerings - AI models/applications, cloud and TPUs - with AI model’s designed to improve AI models and hardware (AlphaEvolve) getting better, Google might even take a long term lead. Though, Jensen is playing Nvidia’s cards perfectly.",

      "selftext_processed": "AMD is competing with Nvidia playing the game Jensen Huang knows better than anyone else but Google is playing the game they have been preparing for since the company ’ s conception . Look at this quote from Larry Page from the year 2000 Artificial intelligence would be the ultimate version of Google . So we had the ultimate search engine it would understand everything on the web it would understand um you know exactly what you wanted and it would give you the right thing . And thats obviously artificial intelligence . Google CoFounder Larry Page Predicts the Future of Search With AI 2000 For those that don ’ t know it was supposedly Larry Page ’ s attitudes about AI that inspired Elon Musk and Sam Altman to start OpenAI . Fullstack AI Now imagine you are tasked with implementing AI in your organisation . Your first thought will probably be Which should I pick ChatGPT immediately comes to mind but you want to do your research properly . Through your research you find that Googles Gemini 3 seems best or second best right now and that their flash models tend to give the most intelligence per buck at least among American AI models . Plus they have one of the leading video models and the leading image model . Perfect . Google seems like a good choice . Especially since people in the company might already be using their AI applications like AntiGravity especially if they improve . But what about implementation Google offers enterpriseready APIs via Vertex with more features coming like auth database and payments Google Cloud for storage and now even at location TPUs that are specialized to run Gemini models as cheaply as possible . Super . Suddenly your entire AI ecosystem is locked into Google and along the way you never_touch an Nvidia product . But before you make your final decision you ask yourself Will Google be able to compete with Nvidia on the hardware side over the long term so I don ’ t get vendorlocked with an inferior offering I ’ ve done enough research about Jensen that I would never_want to bet against the man and I think a ton of companies will feel the same way . I don ’ t imagine Nvidia is particularly or really at all threatened by Google in the short term though Googles TPUs may force Nvidia to lower its prices reducing profit margin . Apparently OpenAI received an Nvidia discount of 30 % because of it according to Dylan Patel from SemiAnalysis worth remembering is that piece by him is still bullish on Nvidia . Though what is actually important is not_the current competitiveness of the TPUs but that Google has a flywheel effect that has barely begun spinning and will become more powerful in the future . AlphaEvolve I allocated around 85 percent of my portfolio into Google in May after Google DeepMind revealed AlphaEvolve A Geminipowered coding agent for designing advanced algorithms The evolutionary AI system had in secret improved everything from the training of their AI models to Googles hardware i.e . their TPUs that are today so good that Anthropic secured a multibillion dollar deal for them with Meta considering the same . The remarkable thing was that AlphaEvolve had been using Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro not_even Gemini 2.5 . Today it ’ s most likely using their internal Gemini 3.0 DeepThink variations and in the future it will use far more powerful models than that . Meaning that the better Google ’ s AI models get the better AlphaEvolve will get at improving Google ’ s models and hardware . The cheaper and better Google ’ s hardware the more powerful models can be built and run . The more powerful the models the better the hardware . And so on . Better AI models could also destroy some of Nvidia ’ s CUDA moat . One reason CUDA has been so important is that it has made it easier for human programmers to write AI hardware code causing a network effect where everyone learnt CUDA . But once AI models become sufficiently advanced the programming difficulty may not_be a concern or Google and Gemini create some CUDAvariant of their own . Rumors also exist of them doing just that . All in all This means that every time Google releases an AI model that is the best in the business it ’ s an acknowledgement that you can build the best models without Nvidia . If they do it often enough AI labs will eventually wonder can you build better AI models without Nvidia This will be especially true if other AIlabs do it too “ resulting in Anthropic training Sonnet and Opus 4.5 on multiple types of hardware including TPUs ” Does this mean I think Nvidia is done for Not_at all as I said Ive spent enough time studying Jensen that Id never_want to bet against him . After all he is a man who roommated with a 17yearold excon covered in knife scars at the age of nine to become the 5trilliondollar man . Jensen has a ton of cards to play and he ’ s already playing them perfectly . Nvidia still has a hardwarehardwaresoftware lead and is likely to retain it at least in the near future . If they make a substantial compute leap Jensen can massively scale up Nvidia ’ s AI lab absorb one of the AI labs or partner with one of them and go for gold in the AI race . He is securing longterm deals with customers to ensure they stay with Nvidia . Nvidia themselves in using AI in its development . He is investing in the entire AI ecosystem . Nvidia will likely begin to offer fullstack solutions of its own . And the compute needs in the future are likely to be so massive it should benefit Nvidia Google and AMD .

      "selftext": "Hey! First post on WSB. Here's why I'm betting big on Rivian: **Customers Love The Product** Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian, currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade, or posts on any of the EV/Rivian forums or subreddits. The product has well-documented reliability issues and despite that is still #1 in EV customer satisfaction. According to Consumer Reports' November 2025 survey, 86% of Rivian owners would buy again. BMW comes in second at 77%. Tesla is third at 75% with complaints about build quality. **CEO Has The Right Stuff** If you're seriously considering investing in Rivian, I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview ([Here's one]( with John Collison, founder of Stripe). I've listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews, and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic, ambitious, and competent CEOs out there. He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009. His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows. Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPO'd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around. Lucid's leadership does not hold a candle to this guy. Go watch them yourself (Marc Winterhoff, Peter Rawlinson) and see the difference. **Solid Company Culture** I don't look at Glassdoor. Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on [Blind]( Before making an investment in a tech company, I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what it's like working there. For example, I don't want to see things like \"excellent work-life balance\" or \"nepotism\" because they suggest an unproductive environment. The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fast-paced, scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently. I like that. **The R2 Is A Game-Changer** At a much more accessible $45,000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S, production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VW-backed Georgia plant. This one makes or breaks the company, and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive. They're also planning a smaller, cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026. **Autonomy & AI Day On Dec 11** Rivian will likely unveil hands-free driving features, an overview of their sensor stack, and future autonomous roadmap. Not yet comparable to Tesla, but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock. **Amazon Delivery Vehicles** Rivian built about 2.5% of Amazon's fleet (30,000 vehicles) with a projection of over 10% by 2030 as gas vans are phased out. Rivian currently accounts for about 80-90% of Amazon's EV fleet. Take a look around you. If you see a cute-looking Amazon van, on the side you'll notice it's \"powered by Rivian\". **Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW** With VW's financial backing, Rivian is developing a modular, vertically-integrated EV software stack. VW already plans to use it across its brands, giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream. Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win. **Major Institutional Backing** Amazon owns 13% and VW owns 12.3% of Rivian. A welcome vote of confidence, given how closely they work together. Vanguard (6%), BlackRock (4%), UBS (1.6%) and a whole host of other well-known institutional investors are in as well. **The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation** I'll admit it - I'm an astrologer. But you can't look at this chart and say something didn't change after the last earnings call. Popped from 12-18, consolidated at 14.5-15, and headed higher all within a month. Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity. This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 12-13 again \"like it always does.\" It has steadily been making higher lows (6 separate times since Apr 2024 - roughly 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and just recently 14) and once it breaks out, all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher. **Some Personal Anecdotes** * An AI/ML PhD friend of mine currently working in the self-driving space claimed that Tesla FSD (Full Self-Driving) is a \"long-running failure\", bought Rivian stock because he \"likes the car and company\" and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle. * My scammer ex-girlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her. I didn't, but every time we'd drive around town and she saw one she'd point at it and excitedly say \"Rivian!\" in that cute little Russian accent of hers. I don't miss her all that much, she was a complete pain in the ass. Really, I don't.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey First post on WSB . Heres why Im betting big on Rivian Customers Love The Product Talk to anyone you know who owns a Rivian currently owns another EV and wants an upgrade or posts on any of the EVRivian forums or subreddits . The product has welldocumented reliability issues and despite that is still 1 in EV customer satisfaction . According to Consumer Reports November 2025 survey 86 % of Rivian owners would buy again . BMW comes in second at 77 % . Tesla is third at 75 % with complaints about build quality . CEO Has The Right Stuff If youre seriously considering investing in Rivian I urge you to watch an RJ Scaringe interview Heres one with John Collison founder of Stripe . Ive listened to hundreds of business and world leader interviews and this guy comes across as one of the most authentic ambitious and competent CEOs out there . He got his PhD from MIT Sloan Automotive Lab and started Rivian in 2009 . His passion for cars and specifically building the best possible electric vehicle from a product perspective really shows . Rivian is often compared to Lucid as car companies that IPOd and fell off a cliff but are still hanging around . Lucids leadership does not_hold a candle to this guy . Go watch them yourself Marc Winterhoff Peter Rawlinson and see the difference . Solid Company Culture I dont look at Glassdoor . Tech people tell you what they really feel about their companies on Blind Before making an investment in a tech company I always look at Blind reviews to get an overall feel for what its like working there . For example I dont want to see things like excellent worklife balance or nepotism because they suggest an unproductive environment . The overall vibe I get from Rivian is a fastpaced scrappy startup that makes a lot of mistakes and pivots frequently . I like that . The R2 Is A GameChanger At a much more accessible $ 45000 base and slightly smaller than the R1S production begins in early 2026 at their massive new VWbacked Georgia plant . This one makes or breaks the company and initial reviews have been overwhelmingly positive . Theyre also planning a smaller cheaper R3 crossover later in 2026 . Autonomy AI Day On Dec 11 Rivian will likely unveil handsfree driving features an overview of their sensor stack and future autonomous roadmap . Not_yet comparable to Tesla but any unexpected good news here can boost the stock . Amazon Delivery Vehicles Rivian built about 2.5 % of Amazons fleet 30000 vehicles with a projection of over 10 % by 2030 as gas vans are phased out . Rivian currently accounts for about 8090 % of Amazons EV fleet . Take a look around you . If you see a cutelooking Amazon van on the side youll notice its powered by Rivian . Platform Architecture Joint Venture With VW With VWs financial backing Rivian is developing a modular verticallyintegrated EV software stack . VW already plans to use it across its brands giving Rivian a software licensing revenue stream . Any other manufacturer adopting the platform would be a major win . Major Institutional Backing Amazon owns 13 % and VW owns 12.3 % of Rivian . A welcome vote of confidence given how closely they work together . Vanguard 6 % BlackRock 4 % UBS 1.6 % and a whole host of other wellknown institutional investors are in as well . The Chart Looks Awfully Like Major Accumulation Ill admit it Im an astrologer . But you cant look at this chart and say something didnt change after the last earnings call . Popped from 1218 consolidated at 14.515 and headed higher all within a month . Every intraday dip is getting bought back up with intensity . This stock has been beaten down for so long that many potential investors who love the company are waiting for it to drop to 1213 again like it always does . It has steadily been making higher lows 6 separate times since Apr 2024 roughly 8 9 10 11 12 and just recently 14 and once it breaks out all these dip buyers who are waiting for Godot are going to have to buy in much higher . Some Personal Anecdotes An AIML PhD friend of mine currently working in the selfdriving space claimed that Tesla FSD Full SelfDriving is a longrunning failure bought Rivian stock because he likes the car and company and will buy a Rivian as his next vehicle . My scammer exgirlfriend had a Tesla but wanted me to buy a Rivian for her . I didnt but every time wed drive around town and she saw one shed point at it and excitedly say Rivian in that cute little Russian accent of hers . I dont miss her all that much she was a complete pain in the ass . Really I dont ."

Throughout that period I have earned a total of $60k and another $60k was given to me due to an accident. My investment is currently sitting on $120k with a dividend yield of 6.4%. I have never spend a single cent for any entertainment purposes from dividends and all the money I had and still receiving from my internship and side job, which are being split 80/20. 80% for investment, 20% on needs (bills and necessities). But for 2026 I really feel like just taking a break and relax from all the things that I have been doing (DRIPS + salary contribution + tracking finances) and really enjoy the fruits of my efforts. But tbh, I do not know how to go about doing that because Ive never done it in my life like going overseas and stuff. Those who have faced the same or similar issue as me, what did you do to really just relax your mind about all these things.",

I have never_spend a single cent for any entertainment purposes from dividends and all the money I had and still receiving from my internship and side job which are being split 8020 . 80 % for investment 20 % on needs bills and necessities . But for 2026 I really feel like just taking a break and relax from all the things that I have been doing DRIPS salary contribution tracking finances and really enjoy the fruits of my efforts . But tbh I do not_know how to go about doing that because Ive never_done it in my life like going overseas and stuff . Those who have faced the same or similar issue as me what did you do to really just relax your mind about all these things ."

      "selftext": "As we all know, 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again, with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains. Personally, as far as an AI bubble is concerned, the market still has legs to run -- and empirical as this is, I don't think we'll have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind. Here's my current portfolio weights, how I'll be reallocating for the new year, and my predictions on how each will move! I'll be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year :) NVDA - 17% Nvidia continues to be my largest holding. There is significant overlap with my ETFs, but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which I'm comfortable having overweight. Doubt we will see 30+% gains after such a huge run-up though, although a 20% gain wouldn't surprise me. QQQ - 16% I've unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didn't realise there were alternatives (QQQM) with much lower expense ratios. Anyway, doesn't make sense for me to sell and buy back, but just a note for beginners. Mag 7 propelled it to 20+% gains this year, I'm predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12% gain in 2026, supported by more mid caps. VOO - 15% Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech. Predicting a healthy 9% as tech continues to outpace other sectors. AAPL - 11% The Vision Pro hasn't seen much success yet, and I think it's very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point. However, with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year, I think it'll continue to see revenue growth. Predicting a 16% upside. META - 9% Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut, hope to see more of that in the coming year. While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now, I don't think it'll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT. As far as I'm concerned, the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage. Share price has been relatively shaky this year, but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18%. VT - 7% Going to continue DCAing into VT, likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year. Non-US markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I don't have enough conviction to go into VXUS. Assuming global markets do better than the US, I'm projecting 11% upside. XLU - 6% My only defensive holding in utilities. Being capital-intensive, utilities should benefit greatly from a low-rate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk. Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well. Don’t expect big gains, at most 8%, just on pace with the overall market. DUOL - 5% One of my only two high-risk plays. Down from highs over 540 this year, share price has begun to consolidate. The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising long-term user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market, but this is a good long-term outlook. With a 34% 3-5 year projected EPS growth rate, I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32% gain. ANET - 3% Last but not least, my smallest holding (for now). My long-term AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have. Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns, but with the prospect of a continue, albeit slowing bull market, I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth. My guess is 35%, and I will be adding ANET/VRT on dips close to their 50MA. Let me know what you guys think about my predictions!",

      "selftext_processed": "As we all know 2025 has been a great year for equities yet again with major indices significantly outpacing historic gains . Personally as far as an AI bubble is concerned the market still has legs to run and empirical as this is I dont think well have a crash when everyone has a crash at the back of their mind . Heres my current portfolio weights how Ill be reallocating for the new year and my predictions on how each will move Ill be deleting my trading apps once the new year starts due to other commitments and come back to this post at the end of next year NVDA 17 % Nvidia continues to be my largest holding . There is significant overlap with my ETFs but it was and continues to be a long hold for me which Im comfortable having overweight . Doubt we will see 30 % gains after such a huge runup though although a 20 % gain wouldnt surprise me . QQQ 16 % Ive unfortunately been holding QQQ from a time I didnt realise there were alternatives QQQM with much lower expense ratios . Anyway doesnt make sense for me to sell and buy back but just a note for beginners . Mag 7 propelled it to 20 % gains this year Im predicting a more conservative but evenly distributed 12 % gain in 2026 supported by more mid caps . VOO 15 % Essentially the same thing as QQQ but with slightly less tech . Predicting a healthy 9 % as tech continues to outpace other sectors . AAPL 11 % The Vision Pro hasnt seen much success yet and I think its very much a work in progress especially given the extremely high price point . However with Apple regaining its spot as the top smartphone manufacturer and likely releasing a foldable phone next year I think itll continue to see revenue growth . Predicting a 16 % upside . META 9 % Great to see that Metaverse expenditure is being cut hope to see more of that in the coming year . While Meta AI is one of the worst AIs out there now I dont think itll be difficult for them to improve their model seeing how quickly Gemini has caught up with ChatGPT . As far as Im concerned the core advertising business continues to be a solid model and Instagram is still growing in terms of MAUs and average usage . Share price has been relatively shaky this year but I think it will deliver more stable shareholder returns of 18 % . VT 7 % Going to continue DCAing into VT likely will be my top holding before the start of the new year . NonUS markets outperformed in the first half of 2025 but I dont have enough conviction to go into VXUS . Assuming global markets do better than the US Im projecting 11 % upside . XLU 6 % My only defensive holding in utilities . Being capitalintensive utilities should benefit greatly from a lowrate environment and having some exposure marginally reduces my drawdown risk . Looking to add on dips to increase holding as well . Don ’ t expect big gains at most 8 % just on pace with the overall market . DUOL 5 % One of my only two highrisk plays . Down from highs over 540 this year share price has begun to consolidate . The CEO mentioned in the Q3 earnings call that they are prioritising longterm user growth and teaching quality which was taken negatively by the market but this is a good longterm outlook . With a 34 % 35 year projected EPS growth rate I expect the market to revalue the company more optimistically with a 32 % gain . ANET 3 % Last but not_least my smallest holding for now . My longterm AI data centre play that has a lot more upside than the big names have . Quite a volatile stock that has a high beta especially in tech downturns but with the prospect of a continue albeit slowing bull market I believe renewed data centre investment will propel sales and earnings growth . My guess is 35 % and I will be adding ANETVRT on dips close to their 50MA . Let me know what you guys think about my predictions"

      "selftext": "Netflix has prevailed in its bid to buy much of Warner Bros. Discovery, agreeing to pay $72 billion for the Burbank-based Warner Bros. film and television studios, HBO Max and HBO. The two companies announced the blockbuster deal early Friday morning. The deal would give Netflix such beloved characters as Batman, Harry Potter and Fred Flintstone. “Our mission has always been to entertain the world,” Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, said in a statement. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies — from timeless classics like ‘Casablanca’ and ‘Citizen Kane’ to modern favorites like ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Friends’ — with our culture-defining titles like ‘Stranger Things,’ ‘KPop Demon Hunters’ and ‘Squid Game,’ we’ll be able to do that even better.” Netflix’s cash and stock transaction is valued at about $27.75 per Warner Bros. Discovery shares. Netflix also agreed to take on more than $10 billion in Warner Bros. debt, pushing the deal’s value to $82.7 billion. The breakthrough came late Thursday, soon after a deadline for deal sweeteners. Netflix, Paramount and Comcast had submitted bids earlier in the week as jockeying intensified for Hollywood’s biggest prize.",

I hadn't really put a finger on the possible value of the write-down, but I know it would be large. However, now we know. Warner Brothers Dscovery has taken a $9 billion write-down of its TV assets. On many levels this doesn't bode well for the company. WBD still has about $43 billion dollars in combined long-term and short-term debt on its balance sheet and still tens of billions of dollars in intangible assets. However, the good thing is that the company has been generating relatively decent free cash flow. So, again, that's a good thing. The companies wanting to buy this company would do well to really knuckle down on doing it's due diligence. At this point, I give the stock a rating of HOLD.",

      "selftext": "From doing past analysis, I realized that most people, including myself, miss out on life-changing huge gains because we sell our stocks too early. There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100-200% and some over 5Y went up 1000%-3000%. One thing I noticed people like to do is day-trade or swing-trade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days. They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly. But then afterwards, the stock that they just sold ends up going up +30% in one day suddenly, then continues to go up consistently day by day, +5%, +7%, +3%... and so on, eventually before you know it, the stock has already went up +100%. Personally, I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buy-and-hold approach. I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future. Hence, I try my absolute best not to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dips/crashes, or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential.",

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries . MY POSITION 200 Contracts of the $ 10 Strike Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $ 3.5 in premiums for a total of $ 71712 TLDR ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdownbig potential catalyst . Education is huge in China households spend 17 % of income on it 5x global avg . Reopening the sector helps job creation consumption and talent development . ﻿﻿If rules loosen TAL EDU become a nearduopoly due to heavy compliance barriers ﻿﻿Stock has been rangebound $ 8 $ 11 but sentiment policy tone in China is improving . Im in Jan 2027 $ 10 calls 200 contracts $ 72K as a longterm bet ."

      "selftext": "MoonLake ($MLTX) is soaring today, and I believe we are just getting started. This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now, and a run-up to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th. Thesis (TL;DR): MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90%—because the market hyper-focused on a single narrowly missed endpoint, not the whole data set. Under the surface, sonelokimab (SLK) hit consistent, significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases, with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks. This is one of those rare moments where “disaster” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity. Data & Why the Panic Is Overdone: • VELA-1: Big win. Mid-30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo, all core secondaries positive. • VELA-2: Drug effect consistent with VELA-1, but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread (p ≈ .05). All secondary endpoints still positive; combined analysis is strongly significant (p < 0.001). [SLK HS VELA Trial Data]( ￼​• Takeaway: High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials. Look at the totality: consistent drug effect, positive secondaries, and durable benefit, not “dead drug.” More Than HS: Platform Upside (4 Indications):SLK is not a one-trick pony. MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications, including: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): Adult and adolescent, with long-term extension data. • Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP): LEDA Phase 2, Company expects to move froward to a Phase 3 Q3 2026. • Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA): S-OLARIS readout Q1 2026. • Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): IZAR Phase 3, 2026. Upcoming Catalysts (Why Act Now): • Dec 15, 2025: FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application. A “yes” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher, while a “not without additional data” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90% one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year. ￼​• Q1–Q2 2026: S-OLARIS (axSpA), VELA-TEEN/long-term HS, IZAR (PsA). You might only have a week or two to get a thesis-confirming or thesis-breaking regulatory answer—at panic-level valuations. Balance Sheet: MoonLake isn’t hurting for cash. They have hundreds of millions on hand, a fresh $75M raise, with extended runway into 2027. You’re not waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst; you’re waiting for data, and more data is coming imminently. Lawsuit/FUD Section (for the Record):Yes, the numerous class actions headlines exist: they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed, if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response. In biotech, legal and headline risk is always present post-drop, but those lawsuits don’t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon. The lawsuits are noise; the SLK’s efficacy and a path forward to an FDA approval is the signal. Risks: • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn. • Pipeline indications could go nowhere and this is still a one-asset, high-volatility biotech—but I like the data so far. Asymmetric Setup: Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what’s not priced in is a credible FDA greenlight, and the multi-indication platform angle. The next immediate catalyst, FDA, will likely decide if this rerates violently higher, in the very near term. This window, with catalyst stacked throughout 2026. And the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits, could close fast. Part of the reason I'm so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock, which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline \"miss\". The data is there - SLK works, the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesn't work. But the data says it does, and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not just HS, but also PPP, PsA, axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesn't work. I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher, and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one. ￼​Disclosure: I (obviously) own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options, my kids even own MLTX. I like the stock. I don't know your personal financial situation, this is not financial advice. Do your own research [I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—I'm posting this one.](",

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake $ MLTX is soaring today and I believe we are just getting started . This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now and a runup to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th . Thesis TLDR MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90 % —because the market hyperfocused on a single narrowly missed endpoint not_the whole data set . Under the surface sonelokimab SLK hit consistent significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks . This is one of those rare moments where “ disaster ” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity . Data Why the Panic Is Overdone • VELA1 Big win . Mid30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo all core secondaries positive . • VELA2 Drug effect consistent with VELA1 but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread p ≈ .05 . All secondary endpoints still positive combined analysis is strongly significant p 0.001 . SLK HS VELA Trial Data ￼​• Takeaway High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials . Look at the totality consistent drug effect positive secondaries and durable benefit not_ “ dead drug. ” More Than HS Platform Upside 4 IndicationsSLK is not_a onetrick pony . MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications including • Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Adult and adolescent with longterm extension data . • Palmoplantar Pustulosis PPP LEDA Phase 2 Company expects to move froward to a Phase 3 Q3 2026 . • Axial Spondyloarthritis axSpA SOLARIS readout Q1 2026 . • Psoriatic Arthritis PsA IZAR Phase 3 2026 . Upcoming Catalysts Why Act Now • Dec 15 2025 FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application . A “ yes ” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher while a “ not without additional data ” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90 % one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year . ￼​• Q1–Q2 2026 SOLARIS axSpA VELATEENlongterm HS IZAR PsA . You might only have a week or two to get a thesisconfirming or thesisbreaking regulatory answer—at paniclevel valuations . Balance Sheet MoonLake isn ’ t hurting for cash . They have hundreds of millions on hand a fresh $ 75M raise with extended runway into 2027 . You ’ re not_waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst you ’ re waiting for data and more data is coming imminently . LawsuitFUD Section for the RecordYes the numerous class actions headlines exist they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response . In biotech legal and headline risk is always present postdrop but those lawsuits don ’ t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon . The lawsuits are noise the SLK ’ s efficacy and a path forward to an FDA approval is the signal . Risks • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn . • Pipeline indications could go nowhere_and this is still a oneasset highvolatility biotech—but I like the data so far . Asymmetric Setup Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what ’ s not_priced in is a credible FDA greenlight and the multiindication platform angle . The next immediate catalyst FDA will likely decide if this rerates violently higher in the very near term . This window with catalyst stacked throughout 2026 . And the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits could close fast . Part of the reason Im so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline miss . The data is there SLK works the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesnt work . But the data says it does and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not_just HS but also PPP PsA axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesnt work . I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one . ￼​Disclosure I obviously own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options my kids even own MLTX . I like the stock . I dont know your personal financial situation this is not_financial advice . Do your own research I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—Im posting this one ."

Dealer Backlash/Cancellations: A group of UK car dealers are publicly protesting $AUTO's high listing prices and are threatening package downgrades/cancellations. 2. Macro Headwinds: Concerns over constrained used car supply (cars selling too fast means dealers buy fewer premium ads) and an FCA investigation into motor finance created industry uncertainty. TL;DR? The market is panicking over dealer squabbles and temporary car supply issues. Today's Price vs. Last Time The current price point is sitting near where it was a couple of years ago. The key difference? The company is fundamentally stronger now. We are buying 2026 earnings at a 2023 valuation. The Buy Thesis: Why You'll Get Rich • The Moat (90%+ Market Share): $AUTO is the UK's undisputed car-buying destination. Dealers must be on the platform. This is a perpetual license to raise prices and print cash. • Insane Margins: A 63% Operating Margin is unheard of for a business like this. It's a tech company masquerading as a car platform. • Share Buybacks: The company is actively executing a huge buyback, confirming that management believes their own stock is dirt cheap. This artificially boosts EPS and rewards shareholders. stop looking at the noise. Look at the balance sheet. This is a high-quality, high-profit monopoly trading at a fear discount. Load up.",

Macro Headwinds Concerns over constrained used car supply cars selling too fast means dealers buy fewer premium ads and an FCA investigation into motor finance created industry uncertainty . TLDR The market is panicking over dealer squabbles and temporary car supply issues . Todays Price vs. Last Time The current price point is sitting near where it was a couple of years ago . The key difference The company is fundamentally stronger now . We are buying 2026 earnings at a 2023 valuation . The Buy Thesis Why Youll Get Rich • The Moat 90 % Market Share $ AUTO is the UKs undisputed carbuying destination . Dealers must be on the platform . This is a perpetual license to raise prices and print cash . • Insane Margins A 63 % Operating Margin is unheard of for a business like this . Its a tech company masquerading as a car platform . • Share Buybacks The company is actively executing a huge buyback confirming that management believes their own stock is dirt cheap . This artificially boosts EPS and rewards shareholders . stop looking at the noise . Look at the balance sheet . This is a highquality highprofit monopoly trading at a fear discount . Load up ."

The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities. >The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound ⁠in Hawaii last month, Bloomberg reported. >Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January, according to the report. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment. >\"Smart move, just late,\" said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber. \"This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought ​years ago.\" >The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality ‌headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. >Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community. >However, it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses, as competitors such as Alphabet's Google, [Apple]( and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts. >The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. >To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year. Overall, large tech companies are expected to spend around $400 billion on AI this year. >The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with million-dollar pay packages.",

The Facebook parents shares rose 4 % as the move eased ‌some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars only for the ‌business to burn more than $ 60 billion since 2020 . The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities . The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the companys annual budget planning for 2026 which included a series of meetings at Zuckerbergs compound ⁠in Hawaii last month Bloomberg reported . Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January according to the report . Meta did not_immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment . Smart move just late said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber . This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not_as prosperous as management thought ​years ago . The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs which produces the companys Quest mixedreality ‌headsets smart glasses made with EssilorLuxotticas RayBan and upcoming augmentedreality glasses . Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community . However it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses as competitors such as Alphabets Google Apple and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts . The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valleys artificialintelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception . To fuel its ambitious goals Meta has committed as much as $ 72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year . Overall large tech companies are expected to spend around $ 400 billion on AI this year . The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with milliondollar pay packages ."

I'm stuck with some janky leveraged etf that barely captures what I'm thinking or building weird options spreads that cost more than i'd make even if I nail it. Like last month, I knew the jobs report was gonna beat expectations by a mile. nailed the call. made literally nothing because there's no clean way to bet on that without buying calls on some tech stock and praying it moves the right way. feels like all this analysis is pointless if i can't actually trade the thesis. maybe i should just give up and buy spy calls like a normal person.",
