      "selftext": "Microsoft shares dropped as much as 3% in Wednesday trading after The Information reported the company lowered sales quotas for AI software products amid customer resistance to newer offerings. The report stated Microsoft reduced expectations for AI agents and advanced AI products after many salespeople missed growth targets, with corporate customers citing difficulty measuring ROI on AI technology. Microsoft quickly pushed back against the report. In an emailed statement to CNBC, the company denied lowering sales quotas, stating \"The Information's story inaccurately combines the concepts of growth and sales quotas.\" A spokesperson clarified the company has not reduced sales targets for its salespeople. Wall Street analysts also disputed the report's significance. Mizuho and other firms called for a \"reset\" in expectations, suggesting the market overreacted to what may have been routine sales adjustments. Microsoft shares recovered some losses following the company's denial, though still closed down on the day.",

      "selftext": "As of 2025, the amount of ETFs that exist on the US stock exchanges has surpassed the amount of stocks. Honestly, this surprised me and I didn't realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up. ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion, you used to be able to refer to them as the \"safer\" option to invest in, but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products, it's even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks. When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage, or 2x short Tesla, it's actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information. If people are willing to pay for products, companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that. [",

Honestly this surprised me and I didnt realize it was that close until the articles and images started coming up . ETFs have evolved passed simplicity in my opinion you used to be able to refer to them as the safer option to invest in but since so many companies are releasing new ETF products its even more complex and in some cases way less safe than even buying stocks . When you can create a Covered Call product on any individual company with leverage or 2x short Tesla its actually getting harder for many beginners to get correct information . If people are willing to pay for products companies will provide them and unfortunately many are taking advantage of that ."

      "selftext": "I keep seeing posts from people obsessively watching for the “next big crash” the charts, the signals, the yield curves, the debt cycles, the “everything bubble.” And honestly, I think a lot of them are still expecting something that’s never coming. Not because the economy is healthy. Not because things are fine. But because what’s happening isn’t a crash it’s a slow, grinding decline that primarily hurts anyone who isn’t already wealthy. The gap is widening, and it’s structural: • Asset inflation keeps running ahead of wage growth • Housing is increasingly unaffordable, even after rate hikes • Stocks and real estate keep rising because all the money is concentrated at the top • Low and middle-income families get squeezed by rent, childcare, insurance, and debt • Any “relief” the Fed delivers just boosts asset holders, not workers • Corporate concentration kills competition and wages • Everything that used to act as a reset valve (recessions, market crashes) now gets aggressively prevented because the wealthy have too much to lose Everyone thinks there’s going to be a dramatic moment, a collapse, a flash crash, a 2008 replay. But the system has quietly evolved into something different: We don’t get “cleansing crashes” anymore. We get permanent pressure. Not a fall. Just a slow suffocation. For the wealthy, this means their assets keep appreciating. For everyone else, it means running faster just to stay in place. People keep waiting for the “big reset.” But the uncomfortable truth is that the pain is already happening, just in the least cinematic way possible: gradual, invisible, and endless. This is what inequality looks like in a modern economy not fireworks, just a widening chasm.",

Not_because the economy is healthy . Not_because things are fine . But because what ’ s happening isn ’ t a crash it ’ s a slow grinding decline that primarily hurts anyone who isn ’ t already wealthy . The gap is widening and it ’ s structural • Asset inflation keeps running ahead of wage growth • Housing is increasingly unaffordable even after rate hikes • Stocks and real estate keep rising because all the money is concentrated at the top • Low and middleincome families get squeezed by rent childcare insurance and debt • Any “ relief ” the Fed delivers just boosts asset holders not_workers • Corporate concentration kills competition and wages • Everything that used to act as a reset valve recessions market crashes now gets aggressively prevented because the wealthy have too much to lose Everyone thinks there ’ s going to be a dramatic moment a collapse a flash crash a 2008 replay . But the system has quietly evolved into something different We don ’ t get “ cleansing crashes ” anymore . We get permanent pressure . Not_a fall . Just a slow suffocation . For the wealthy this means their assets keep appreciating . For everyone else it means running faster just to stay in place . People keep waiting for the “ big reset. ” But the uncomfortable truth is that the pain is already happening just in the least cinematic way possible gradual invisible and endless . This is what inequality looks like in a modern economy not_fireworks just a widening chasm ."

      "selftext": "**Warning: Autism Ahead​** Ouster OS1​ [Link]( ​is the **first high-resolution 3D lidar sensor approved under the Blue UAS Framework**​, ​meaning it's currently the **only ​**NDAA-compliant 3D LiDAR option for defense drones. \\--- **TL;DR**: Ondas Holdings ($ONDS) just won a contract to deploy \"thousands of drones\" for border protection. They deliberately hide their supply chain. I dug through SEC filings and specs. For NDAA-compliant 3D LiDAR, there's exactly one approved option: Ouster ($OUST). \\--- **The** **Catalyst** (**today**) Ondas announced they won a strategic government tender as prime contractor for an autonomous border protection system. Key details: \\- Multi-year program deploying thousands of drones​ \\- Initial purchase order expected January 2026 \\- Beat major defense primes in competitive evaluation \\- Includes persistent (Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaisance (there's a fancy banned acronym WSB thinks is a low market cap ticker)), swarm deployment, and autonomous threat detection \\--- The Supply Chain Problem​ Ondas runs one of the most opaque supply chains I've seen in a public company. Their 10-K explicitly acknowledges \"sole source suppliers\" for hardware components but names zero vendors​​. No LiDAR supplier. No semiconductor partner. No IMU source. Nothing. Why? Defense contracts require NDAA compliance, and loose lips sink ships (or drone programs). \\--- The Spec Sheet​ But they do publish specifications. The Optimus System (their flagship autonomous drone) includes LiDAR with: \\- 394-foot range \\- 300,000 points per square meter \\- 1cm accuracy That's industrial-grade 3D LiDAR. Not some hobby sensor. \\--- The Chokepoint​ Here's where it gets interesting. The DoD runs the Blue UAS Framework; ​an approved list of NDAA-compliant drone components. If you want government contracts, you need Blue UAS approved parts. Ouster OS1 is the first and only high-resolution 3D LiDAR sensor on the Blue UAS approved list. Read that again. For any defense drone program requiring 3D LiDAR and NDAA compliance, Ouster is currently the only game in town. \\--- The Math​ \\- \"Thousands of drones\" = let's conservatively say 2,000-5,000 units \\- Industrial LiDAR sensors run $1,000-2,500 per unit \\- That's $2M-$12.5M in sensor revenue for Ouster from this single contract \\- Ouster did $33M revenue last quarter This is potentially 10-40% of a quarter's revenue from one customer relationship nobody's talking about. \\--- Why the Market Hasn't Connected This​ 1. Ondas intentionally obscures their supply chain 2. No analyst coverage mentions Ouster as a supplier 3. The Blue UAS approval only happened in June 2025 4. NDAA compliance deadline isn't until June 2026, so most haven't focused on the chokepoint yet \\--- Risks​ \\- This is inference, not confirmed. Ondas could be using proprietary sensors or a supplier I haven't identified \\- The January PO could slip \\- Ouster could have competitors approved by the time production scales \\- I'm long calls so I'm biased \\--- Position: OUST Feb 20 2026 $27C \\--- Sources: \\- ​[Autism 1]( \\- [Autism 2]( \\- [Autism 3]( \\- [Autism 4]( Not financial advice. Do your own DD. I eat powder blue​ crayons. TL:DR - ​buy $OUST",

TLDR Ondas Holdings $ ONDS just won a contract to deploy thousands of drones for border protection . They deliberately hide their supply chain . I dug through SEC filings and specs . For NDAAcompliant 3D LiDAR theres exactly one approved option Ouster $ OUST . The Catalyst today Ondas announced they won a strategic government tender as prime contractor for an autonomous border protection system . Key details Multiyear program deploying thousands of drones​ Initial purchase order expected January 2026 Beat major defense primes in competitive evaluation Includes persistent Intelligence Surveillance Reconnaisance theres a fancy banned acronym WSB thinks is a low market cap ticker swarm deployment and autonomous threat detection The Supply Chain Problem​ Ondas runs one of the most opaque supply chains Ive seen in a public company . Their 10K explicitly acknowledges sole source suppliers for hardware components but names zero vendors​​ . No_LiDAR supplier . No_semiconductor partner . No_IMU source . Nothing_Why Defense contracts require NDAA compliance and loose lips sink ships or drone programs . The Spec Sheet​ But they do publish specifications . The Optimus System their flagship autonomous drone includes LiDAR with 394foot range 300000 points per square meter 1cm accuracy Thats industrialgrade 3D LiDAR . Not_some hobby sensor . The Chokepoint​ Heres where it gets interesting . The DoD runs the Blue UAS Framework ​an approved list of NDAAcompliant drone components . If you want government contracts you need Blue UAS approved parts . Ouster OS1 is the first and only highresolution 3D LiDAR sensor on the Blue UAS approved list . Read that again . For any defense drone program requiring 3D LiDAR and NDAA compliance Ouster is currently the only game in town . The Math​ Thousands of drones lets conservatively say 20005000 units Industrial LiDAR sensors run $ 10002500 per unit Thats $ 2M $ 12.5M in sensor revenue for Ouster from this single contract Ouster did $ 33M revenue last quarter This is potentially 1040 % of a quarters revenue from one customer relationship nobodys_talking about . Why the Market Hasnt Connected This​ 1 . Ondas intentionally obscures their supply chain 2 . No_analyst coverage mentions Ouster as a supplier 3 . The Blue UAS approval only happened in June 2025 4 . NDAA compliance deadline isnt until June 2026 so most havent focused on the chokepoint yet Risks​ This is inference not_confirmed .

      "selftext": "Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. ($CRWD) reported a classic beat and raise quarter last night, however the stock still sold off about 3% in after hours trading. Then this morning the stock opened even lower, falling to about $486. That ended up being the low of the day before it ripped almost 7% off the bottom and closed up around 1.5%. Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights, things that stood out to me: \\- Revenue grew 22% YoY to $1.23 billion, beating the $1.22 billion estimate \\- Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents, beating the 94 cent estimate \\- Added $265m of net new ARR in the quarter (+73% YoY) \\- ARR as of October 31st, 2025 was $4.92b (+23% YoY) \\- $398m in operating cash flow vs $326m last year \\- $296m in free cash flow vs $231m last year \\- Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and net new ARR. CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him. This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings, and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and don't know why they sold. Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically, and this time doesn't look any different to me. The fundamentals here are strong, this quarter lines up the next leg of growth, and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market. So at these levels, do you guys view $CRWD as a buy, hold, or sell? (I do personally own the stock).",

      "selftext_processed": "Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. $ CRWD reported a classic beat and raise quarter last night however the stock still sold off about 3 % in after hours trading . Then this morning the stock opened even lower falling to about $ 486 . That ended up being the low of the day before it ripped almost 7 % off the bottom and closed up around 1.5 % . Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights things that stood out to me Revenue grew 22 % YoY to $ 1.23 billion beating the $ 1.22 billion estimate Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents beating the 94 cent estimate Added $ 265m of net new ARR in the quarter 73 % YoY ARR as of October 31st 2025 was $ 4.92b 23 % YoY $ 398m in operating cash flow vs $ 326m last year $ 296m in free cash flow vs $ 231m last year Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS operating cash flow free cash flow and net new ARR . CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him . This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and dont know why they sold . Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically and this time doesnt look any different to me . The fundamentals here are strong this quarter lines up the next leg of growth and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market . So at these levels do you guys view $ CRWD as a buy hold or sell I do personally own the stock ."

      "selftext": "What are your thoughts on ADBE before they report earnings on Dec 10? The company is down 37% over the last year and 25.9% YTD. They are currently trading at a PE of 20 (5 year average is 41), while the S&P is trading at a PE ratio of 30. The company is growing revenue by about 10% year over year vs the S&P at 5%. They also have very little debt, coming in at 4% vs the average of the S&P at 25%. They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter. They grew free cash flow by 52% over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares (25 billion through 2028 to be exact). Adobe’s profit margins are steady at 29% over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10% per year since 2022. They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at, and yet the price continues to fall. Am I missing something here? I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn’t like them, but the numbers don’t reflect that. I also hear that as much as the user base does not like their pricing, they have no other alternative but to use their products. Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels? If not, what price are you looking to start a position? Or why are you not starting a position?",

They are currently trading at a PE of 20 5 year average is 41 while the SP is trading at a PE ratio of 30 . The company is growing revenue by about 10 % year over year vs the SP at 5 % . They also have very little debt coming in at 4 % vs the average of the SP at 25 % . They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter . They grew free cash flow by 52 % over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares 25 billion through 2028 to be exact . Adobe ’ s profit margins are steady at 29 % over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10 % per year since 2022 . They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at and yet the price continues to fall . Am I missing something here I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn ’ t like them but the numbers don ’ t reflect that . I also hear that as much as the user base does not_like their pricing they have no_other alternative but to use their products . Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels If not_what price are you looking to start a position Or why are you not_starting a position"

      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about the fabled “AI Bubble” but I see a much different problem all together. Here’s what I see in phases. Just my DD. Phase 1: AI demand will keep exploding for years, like a river that keeps widening no matter how many dams you build. Look at the Micron news recently, or the Genesis Executive Order. The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave, even if the economy is doing crap (it is). Phase 2: Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can’t get entry level jobs. Right now, AI layoffs feel like cutting “cost fat,” but if they keep going, you’re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive. Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke? Who will buy a house when they can’t establish credit or a down payment? You see how this trickles? Phase 3: Structural unemployment doesn’t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries. I’m talking entry level positions in finance, HR, hospitality, etc, etc. Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entry-level coding, customer support, basic analysis, HR screening, or content production, companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans, so those roles don’t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay. Over time, this creates a gap: a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no longer exist, while new AI-era jobs (prompt engineers, system architects, AI ops, etc.) require skills, credentials, or geography that many of them don’t have. What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don’t have a career option in their major? *This is kind of a doomer post, so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong. I hope this country can thrive, but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone is talking about the fabled “ AI Bubble ” but I see a much different problem all together . Here ’ s what I see in phases . Just my DD . Phase 1 AI demand will keep exploding for years like a river that keeps widening no_matter how many dams you build . Look at the Micron news recently or the Genesis Executive Order . The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave even if the economy is doing crap it is . Phase 2 Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can ’ t get entry level jobs . Right now AI layoffs feel like cutting “ cost fat ” but if they keep going you ’ re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive . Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke Who will buy a house when they can ’ t establish credit or a down payment You see how this trickles Phase 3 Structural unemployment doesn ’ t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries . I ’ m talking entry level positions in finance HR hospitality etc etc . Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entrylevel coding customer support basic analysis HR screening or content production companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans so those roles don ’ t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay . Over time this creates a gap a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no_longer exist while new AIera jobs prompt engineers system architects AI ops etc . require skills credentials or geography that many of them don ’ t have . What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don ’ t have a career option in their major This is kind of a doomer post so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong . I hope this country can thrive but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming ."

As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading, this shift is hard to ignore. My key considerations: If rate cuts materialize: Could drive gains in tech, high growth, and high beta sectors, potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side: Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a rate-cut environment, though rate-sensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution: If markets overprice “easing” expectations, a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives: With rising probability of rate cuts, would you preemptively position in growth stocks/tech sectors, or maintain defensive holdings/cash reserves? If trading options or high volatility assets, how would you manage potential market turbulence? Is this a trend driven opportunity or a short-term sentiment-fueled rally?

Capital Return: Shift from cash hoarding to shareholder returns (buybacks + dividends). Valuation check: Trades at 27.1x P/E, which is a 27% discount to the peer group average of 37x. Durable advantage + reasonable price. Business Segments: Search: $56.6B revenue (Q3 '24), 14.5% YoY growth. 90% global market share remains stable despite AI threats. YouTube: $50B+ revenue (ads + subs). 2.53B reach. Dominant in streaming watch time. Cloud (GCP): $15.2B revenue (Q3 '25), 30% YoY growth, 24% operating margins. 90% of AI unicorns use GCP. Financial Health: Cash: $66.7B TTM Free Cash Flow (3.2% yield). Balance Sheet: Fortress balance sheet with $76.9B net cash and minimal debt (0.11 D/E ratio). Management (Sundar Pichai): Proven track record (Chrome, Android integration, GCP growth from 6% to 13% share). Successfully navigated AI pivot with Gemini deployment to 1B+ users. Multiples: Current P/E: 27.1x. • FCF Yield: \\~3.2%. Total Yield: \\~2.3% (2% buyback yield + 0.3% dividend yield). Capital Allocation: retiring 2-3% of shares annually; initiated first-ever dividend ($0.20/quarter). Low payout ratio (8.29%) leaves room for growth. Market Positioning: Not cheap, but valuation is attractive relative to the S&P 500 and tech peers. TPU Advantage: Vertically integrated chip stack allows for lower cost of compute for AI, protecting margins better than competitors renting Nvidia GPUs. Expert Views: Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO): Acknowledged the quality of Google's TPU program. Internal Sentiment: CEO Pichai maintains top 5% approval ratings among peer CEOs. Competitive Check: Gemini 3 Pro and Veo 3 killing it on benchmarks. Here's my workflow visualized: [ BUY / BULLISH Conclusion: Alphabet offers a rare combination of growth (Cloud/AI) and value (Search cash cow). The transition to custom silicon (TPUs) creates a defensible long-term infrastructure advantage, while the new capital return program sets a floor for investor returns. Risks regarding AI disruption in search are mitigated by their own AI integration and hardware advantages.",

Memory shortage could delay AI projects, productivity gains. SK Hynix predicts memory shortage to last through late 2027. Smartphone makers warn of price rises due to soaring memory costs. An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumer-electronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies, as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data. The squeeze spans almost every type of memory, from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that feeds AI chips in data centers. Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February, according to market-research firm TrendForce, drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run. The fallout could reach beyond tech. Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AI-based productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure. It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate US tariffs. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta in October asked Micron for open-ended orders, telling the company they will take as much as it can deliver, irrespective of price, according to two people briefed on the talks. ::",

      "selftext": "Today’s rumor out of Politico is that Trump will issue an EO to push development of robotics. One one hand, politically we have a push to deport labor and replace with H1B Visas, and provide no support to help displaced American workers. On the other side we see another opportunity for tech companies to sell more products through robotics and further displace more workers. Politically and economically don’t see the improvements for Americans. However, there will be obvious opportunities to inflate tech stocks further. How do we see all this playing out in 2026?",

It was a valuable kick start as I wasn't investing anything prior to that, so I'm grateful for the good habits its offered me. I started my career post college about 3.5 years ago and for the last couple years I've been feeling anxious about getting my money to Vanguard, Schwab, or Fidelity. They hold a lot of my savings so I have been nervous about transferring and if it's a smart choice. I know the fees are super high with Edward jones and I feel pretty terrible about basically dealing with that for a decade but it has to be better than not investing at all right? Just wanted some advice about how to evaluate the other competitors and how to safely swap all my money out or will EJ screw me going out the door? Also how easy is it to setup a backdoor Roth on the other platforms? Any advice will be welcome, just feel kind of sucky that I was screwed on fees for the most important decade of market maturity.",

It was a valuable kick start as I wasnt investing anything prior to that so Im grateful for the good habits its offered me . I started my career post college about 3.5 years ago and for the last couple years Ive been feeling anxious about getting my money to Vanguard Schwab or Fidelity . They hold a lot of my savings so I have been nervous about transferring and if its a smart choice . I know the fees are super high with Edward jones and I feel pretty terrible about basically dealing with that for a decade but it has to be better than not_investing at all right Just wanted some advice about how to evaluate the other competitors and how to safely swap all my money out or will EJ screw me going out the door Also how easy is it to setup a backdoor Roth on the other platforms Any advice will be welcome just feel kind of sucky that I was screwed on fees for the most important decade of market maturity ."

      "selftext": "So I've been investing for years and honestly I thought I was doing pretty well, nothing crazy but decent returns, portfolio is growing, and I felt good about my strategy and everything. Then I started looking at what other people actually hold on blossom and man that was humbling as hell, like I'm sitting here proud of my 40% voo 30% individual stocks 30% cash thinking I'm being smart and diversified, meanwhile everyone else my age is way more aggressive and honestly crushing it because of it. For instance I saw one dude's portfolio that's like 80% growth stocks and he's up 45% this year while I'm at maybe 18%, which made me realize I'm probably being too conservative for someone with 35 years till retirement, but the weirdest part was seeing how many people just hold 3-5 positions total and do better than my diversified 25 stock portfolio, kinda makes you question if diversification is actually helping or just watering down returns tbh. Not saying I'm gonna copy what other people do but it def made me rethink my whole approach, like maybe I should take more risk while I'm young instead of investing like I'm already 50, idk… anyone else compares their portfolio to others and realizes you're way more conservative than you thought? Kinda a weird feeling…",

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not priced in. edit: this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards. Reverse reddit. Calls. As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started. Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1, 2, and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients. So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market. The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not going further down. So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point. Low risk of losing any significant amounts. The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies. before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma; the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit. lower side seems to be non-existent while the up side seems to be 10x. What am i missing here? Postion: 30k shares at 27.5 Average.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Moderna bottomed out where it was when it started in 2019 on their cancer immunotherapy . Intrinsic value of time and trials is not_priced in . edit this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards . Reverse reddit . Calls . As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started . Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1 2 and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients . So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market . The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not_going further down . So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point . Low risk of losing any significant amounts . The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not_factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies . before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit . lower side seems to be nonexistent while the up side seems to be 10x . What am i missing here Postion 30k shares at 27.5 Average ."

      "selftext": "Have been doing business with a hard money lending investment partnership. Generally I have been collecting an average of 9.5% interest on each deal, with the deals being 12 months and backed up by 50% LTV real estate. Not crazy minimums, around 25K USD. All of my investments have performed and none defaulted, pretty solid underwriting and only on commercial stuff. Here is my question…I can borrow against my investment portfolio at a 4.97% rate, risk being it is variable and tied to fed rate. Is it a completely foolish idea to borrow against this, lend the money via the hard money lender, and make the difference on the spread of the two rates?",

      "selftext": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom, market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle (ORCL.US) might issue up to $100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions. Worries over Oracle's debt situation drove its five year credit default swap (CDS) to surge to a three year high. However, BNP Paribas believes Oracle's actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $100 billion. Therefore, Oracle may only need to issue $25 billion to $35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development. While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the company's recent $18 billion bond offering, it remains far below the $100 billion level that had investors concerned. It's worth noting that given Oracle's high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business, we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden. Management could also explore alternative financing solutions (such as vendor financing) to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures. Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “Overweight” rating, but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations, some have lowered their target price from $430 to $390. Furthermore, the market currently prices Oracle's collaboration with OpenAI at only a “minimal upside.” This can be calculated: approximately 84% of Oracle's current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses. Estimates suggest Oracle's cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027. This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets.",

Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “ Overweight ” rating but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations some have lowered their target price from $ 430 to $ 390 . Furthermore the market currently prices Oracles collaboration with OpenAI at only a “ minimal upside. ” This can be calculated approximately 84 % of Oracles current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses . Estimates suggest Oracles cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $ 13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027 . This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets ."

According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed.

      "selftext": "Here are a few stocks I'm tracking and analyzing: 1. AVGO: Broadcom's custom AI accelerators and networking equipment appear poised for sustained momentum, and their valuations seem more reasonable compared to stocks purely riding hype. 2. MSFT: Cloud and enterprise demand remain robust; while less flashy than other stocks, Microsoft's shares offer greater safety if the macroeconomy stumbles. 3. GOOGL: They continue to profit from advertising and cloud services, and their investments in AI appear promising. I'm not looking for potential winners, but rather which stocks might actually hold up through the end of the year or even continue to rise in December. I'd appreciate your valuable insights. Invest cautiously don't blindly follow trends!!!!!",

      "selftext": "The latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.

      "title": "Macy’s drops 7% pre-market on strongest growth in 3 years while raising outlook and warning on holiday spending and tariffs",
      "selftext": "No paywall: [ >Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum. >The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion. >Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace. >It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. >Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. >And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter. >Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday. >In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season. >“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. >He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury. >Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: >Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents >Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected >Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open. >Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. >The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. >In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents. >Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter. >In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%. >Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%. >Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs. >He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. >“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.” >The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. >For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors. >Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said. >Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs. >As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "No_paywall Macy ’ s on Wednesday beat Wall Street ’ s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company ’ s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum . The department store operator raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook after its betterthanexpected fiscal third quarter . The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2 and $ 2.20 up from its previous expectation of $ 1.70 to $ 2.05 and net sales of $ 21.48 billion to $ 21.63 billion compared with its prior outlook of $ 21.15 billion and $ 21.45 billion . Macy ’ s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5 % comparable sales growth from the previous year . That compares to its previous expectations for a yearoveryear decline of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % . The industry metric takes out onetime dynamics like store openings and closures and Macy ’ s includes merchandise that it owns items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its thirdparty online marketplace . It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy ’ s raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook . The company had cut its fullyear earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs more promotions and “ some moderation ” in discretionary spending . Even so the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the yearago net sales of $ 22.29 billion . Macy ’ s said about $ 700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year which ended Feb. 1 and in the early part of this fiscal year . And Macy ’ s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter . Shares dropped about 6 % in premarket trading on Wednesday . In an interview with CNBC CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “ prudent view ” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough yearoveryear comparisons and because it ’ s not_sure how “ aspirational customers ” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured may spend during the season . “ We ’ re pleased with the fourth quarter to date but we have a big holiday in front of us ” he said . He said Macy ’ s department store model is an advantage during the giftgiving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices from offprice to luxury . Here ’ s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue $ 4.71 billion vs. $ 4.62 billion expected Macy ’ s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales particularly for its namesake brand . Macy ’ s department stores account for the majority of the New York Citybased legacy retailer ’ s business but their performance has lagged behind the company ’ s higherend department store Bloomingdale ’ s and beauty chain Bluemercury . To try to reverse that trend the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing sharper merchandise and eyecatching displays at Macy ’ s stores . It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations which were dubbed the “ First 50 ” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy ’ s locations . That ’ s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy ’ s plans to keep open . Along with the added investment it has shuttered lowerperforming Macy ’ s locations . It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027 while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale ’ s and Bluemercury . The company hasn ’ t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year . In the threemonth period that ended Nov. 1 Macy ’ s net income fell to $ 11 million or 4 cents per share compared with $ 28 million or 10 cents per share in the yearago period . Adjusting for some onetime items including gains on the sale of real estate it reported earnings per share of 9 cents . Revenue decreased from $ 4.74 billion in the yearago quarter . In the fiscal third quarter companywide comparable sales rose 3.2 % including owned and licensed merchandise and its thirdparty marketplace . When the company excluded stores that won ’ t be part of its goforward business that growth was 3.4 % . Bloomingdale ’ s posted the strongest performance of the company ’ s brands with comparable sales jumping 9 % year over year on an ownedpluslicensed basis including its thirdparty marketplace . And Bluemercury ’ s comparable sales increased 1.1 % . Spring attributed the company ’ s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy ’ s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like highend home goods company MacKenzieChilds . He said he visited Macy ’ s stores and those of its competitors on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw . “ I like the way we ’ re showing up ” he said . “ We look crisp . We look clean . We look interesting compelling inspiring easy to shop. ” The snap to cooler weather helped too he said . As temperatures turned cooler in October shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters outerwear and boots . For the holiday season Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the yearago period at Macy ’ s stores and website along with those of its competitors . Higher tariffs however will mean higher prices for some items . Macy ’ s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected he said . Still Spring said Macy ’ s has made “ selective ” price increases in almost every category with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs . As of Tuesday ’ s close Macy ’ s shares have risen about 34 % so far this year . That outpaces the SP 500′s 16 % gains during the same period . Macy ’ s stock closed Tuesday at $ 22.71 bringing the company ’ s market cap to about $ 6.10 billion ."

Here in Italy, capital gains on stocks, bonds, and similar instruments are taxed at 26%, while gains on government bonds are taxed at 12.5%. I trade with Fineco Bank, and each order to buy stocks, bonds, etc. costs €19, plus another €19 to sell. Thanks!",

      "selftext": "* The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum, and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 4:49:11 PM EST. * BMNR price increased by 10.26% yesterday. * Today's Fusaka update marks Ethereum's second major network enhancement of 2025, following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th, which sparked a 29% rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations. * The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits, expanding transaction capacity per block (increasing TPS), and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling. This makes the network more secure, faster, more efficient, and with lower gas fees. A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets. It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure, \"bank-grade\" hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor. * This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further, with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster. * Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, with a near-term downside to $2,500. But the downside is minor compared to the upside. * Today, the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act, a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming near-term catalysts for BMNR after today's Fusaka upgrade: * A probable Fed rate cut (CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8% chance of a 25-bp cut) next Wednesday will increase liquidity. * The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17, 2025, with a bipartisan vote, and the bill has moved to the Senate. The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption, particularly among banks and the Fed. * Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system. Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNR's underlying largest asset. * Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026. * Achieving the Alchemy of 5% would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve. BMNR currently owns more than 3% of the total ETH. * Moonshots, which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network * Increasing Institutional Ownership",

      "selftext_processed": "The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 44911 PM EST . BMNR price increased by 10.26 % yesterday . Todays Fusaka update marks Ethereums second major network enhancement of 2025 following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th which sparked a 29 % rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations . The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits expanding transaction capacity per block increasing TPS and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling . This makes the network more secure faster more efficient and with lower gas fees . A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets . It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure bankgrade hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor . This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster . Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $ 7000 and $ 9000 by early 2026 with a nearterm downside to $ 2500 . But the downside is minor compared to the upside . Today the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter . BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming nearterm catalysts for BMNR after todays Fusaka upgrade A probable Fed rate cut CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8 % chance of a 25bp cut next Wednesday will increase liquidity . The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17 2025 with a bipartisan vote and the bill has moved to the Senate . The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption particularly among banks and the Fed . Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system . Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNRs underlying largest asset . Made in America Validator Network MAVAN for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026 . Achieving the Alchemy of 5 % would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve . BMNR currently owns more than 3 % of the total ETH . Moonshots which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network Increasing Institutional Ownership"

The rebound from Tuesday seems to be holding, even with mixed signals coming from manufacturing data, holiday spending, and the broader macro picture. The Fed narrative is shifting again: interviews for Powell’s potential successor were reportedly cancelled, which has strengthened expectations that Kevin Hassett who’s generally viewed as a rate-cut supporter could take over next year. That’s adding another layer to the rate-cut speculation already building. Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week’s meeting have climbed to 87%, up sharply from 63% a month ago. Today’s focus is on incoming data: ADP jobs report, expected to show very soft hiring (10k vs 42k prior). ISM services, especially the prices-paid and employment components. Industrial production also on the radar. With official government jobs data landing only after next week’s Fed decision, the market is relying more heavily on private reports than usual.",

The Fed narrative is shifting again interviews for Powell ’ s potential successor were reportedly cancelled which has strengthened expectations that Kevin Hassett who ’ s generally viewed as a ratecut supporter could take over next year . That ’ s adding another layer to the ratecut speculation already building . Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week ’ s meeting have climbed to 87 % up sharply from 63 % a month ago . Today ’ s focus is on incoming data ADP jobs report expected to show very soft hiring 10k vs 42k prior . ISM services especially the pricespaid and employment components . Industrial production also on the radar . With official government jobs data landing only after next week ’ s Fed decision the market is relying more heavily on private reports than usual ."

      "selftext": "10 months ago I posted a DD on Intel in here on why Intel is going to go big. Back then the price was at 22.5$ and I had 3k shares. Fast forward to 10 months later and I increased my position to 10.100 shares for an average of 23.5$ and now Intel is at 43.5$. This thing can and, if macro allows, will go a lot higher. We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future). Currently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months. In nana we trust.",

      "selftext": "Weekly mortgage data came in with a pretty mixed picture. The average 30-year fixed rate for conforming loans ($806,500 or below) ticked down to 6.32%, from 6.40% the week prior. Despite lower rates, refinance applications fell 4%, which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels. On the other hand, purchase applications rose 3%, suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets. Overall, rates drifting lower is good news, but the demand response is still pretty uneven. It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior.

The average 30year fixed rate for conforming loans $ 806500 or below ticked down to 6.32 % from 6.40 % the week prior . Despite lower rates refinance applications fell 4 % which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels . On the other hand purchase applications rose 3 % suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets . Overall rates drifting lower is good news but the demand response is still pretty uneven . It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior .

Yeah, their finances look terrible, yeah the sentiment towards them among online communities is bad BUT I see 2 things that are likely to happen. Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout, or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own (Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy, Rayman, Prince of Persia etc.) they could completely turn around their financial results. Now I'm not saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I don't think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think. I would like to hear why I'm stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into.",

Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own Assassins Creed Far Cry Tom Clancy Rayman Prince of Persia etc . they could completely turn around their financial results . Now Im not_saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I dont think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think . I would like to hear why Im stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, 22M here. I’m current sitting on $24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up. I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on, and want to start thinking a bit more long term. I previously thought of going 60% nasdaq and 40% all world, but at my age this seems a bit too boring. I want to be a bit more risky until age 25-30 before I start to get super safe with my investments. So I was thinking 100% Mag-7. Like I mentioned i’ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk, and this would be for long term holding. I would contribute around $600/month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction, then would go all in with the $24k (into Mag-7, and save about 20% for some high risk AI/Nuclear/Quantum plays). Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i’m not missing anything important, besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride. Thanks",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys 22M here . I ’ m current sitting on $ 24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up . I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on and want to start thinking a bit more long term . I previously thought of going 60 % nasdaq and 40 % all world but at my age this seems a bit too boring . I want to be a bit more risky until age 2530 before I start to get super safe with my investments . So I was thinking 100 % Mag7 . Like I mentioned i ’ ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk and this would be for long term holding . I would contribute around $ 600month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction then would go all in with the $ 24k into Mag7 and save about 20 % for some high risk AINuclearQuantum plays . Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i ’ m not_missing anything important besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Hello all! My parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&P-500-level returns with a little diversification. They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week. Here’s the rough allocation we’re considering: U.S. Large Cap (S&P-ish): SCHX – 40% Total U.S. Market: SCHB – 30% Developed International: SCHF – 10% Emerging Markets: SCHE – 5% U.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10% TIPS: SCHP – 5% All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab. Questions: 1. Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately? 2. Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)? 3. Would a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate? 4. Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY? Thanks in advance for any input.",

They just inherited $ 500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months . They don ’ t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility . Their goal is basically SP500level returns with a little diversification . They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “ should ” sign with him . We ’ re not_sure that ’ s necessary since they ’ re leaning toward a simple lowfee ETFbased plan and dollarcost averaging $ 5–10k per week . Here ’ s the rough allocation we ’ re considering U.S. Large Cap SPish SCHX – 40 % Total U.S. Market SCHB – 30 % Developed International SCHF – 10 % Emerging Markets SCHE – 5 % U.S. Bonds SCHZ – 10 % TIPS SCHP – 5 % All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab . Questions 1 . Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid60s who don ’ t need the money immediately 2 . Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup ETF vs mutual fund tax considerations rebalancing etc . 3 . Would a simpler onefund option like SWANXSWYNX be more appropriate 4 . Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary or is this straightforward enough to DIY Thanks in advance for any input ."

      "selftext": "Here's my situation. I've got about $900K in a non-IRA (Schwab) in an Irrevocable Trust (I'm the sole Beneficiary & Trustee if that matters - the Trust itself is complex, but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it). I want to get a line-of-credit loan of perhaps $150K, that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution (where I have about $700K) whenever I feel like it's time to ring the register on some position there. Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate). (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL) If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns. I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%). I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing. Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money. I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan. I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

Ive got about $ 900K in a nonIRA Schwab in an Irrevocable Trust Im the sole Beneficiary Trustee if that matters the Trust itself is complex but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it . I want to get a lineofcredit loan of perhaps $ 150K that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution where I have about $ 700K whenever I feel like its time to ring the register on some position there . Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now or soon will be longterm unrealized gains because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150 % of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver94 % plan I cant extract the gains indeed some of these gains are 6X so most of the proceeds would be gains and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare i.e . the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150 % would be equivalent to a 25 % implicit tax rate . I could retain the income in the Trust but that would be at a 23.8 % haircut 20 % longterm capgains 3.8 % ACA tax oh the irony LOL If it matters this $ 150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house for my personal residence use on a property that the Trust owns . I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab but the interest rate is ridiculous like 11 % . I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25 % but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there as well as them having notsogood_service although since I wouldnt be doing much I guess it wouldnt be a big thing . Any transfer would be to my Trust nonIRA actually checking account associated with the Trust nonIRA at Schwab which is the account that I would be using to spend the money . I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB and he got something like 6 % on a loan although this wasnt a Trust account and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan . I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower my own financial situation is irrelevant for the record my credit score is A but of course my official income is very low LOL ."

      "selftext": "Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest. Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. Still, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile. [Link to article](",

They seem more resilient from other AI stocks, given the breadth of their offerings and how they fared through 08 and COVID.

      "title": "Tesla x Michael Burry x Musk lies",
      "selftext": "You don't need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musk's LIES. Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla. Let’s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed. Feel free to verify each statement yourself :) Long story short, Burry said has an history of going all-in in whatever sounds cool, rarely following up on promises and that competition wins. Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 2020/2021. He then moved to full-self driving as its \"main goal\", but Google’s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4. Tesla? 20 cars that still need supervision (level 2+) but hear me out, he's gonna DOUBLE it to 40 by late December. Ready for the misleading headlines \"Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network\" ??? So after failing with this, he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots. Last year he promised by the end of this year he'd produce 5000 robots. Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that’s just what he dies. He got his Trillion dollar package, he's good. In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality... so, as Burry said, the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elon's total addressable market. Now, I personally don't trust a management who doesn't offer reliable projections. When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls, their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up. Just take note, for each company, of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters, set it on your calendar to check back on it and you’ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don’t have time to listen/read all of the guidance, copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto :) ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious, never overpromises and often overdelivers. That's a company you can trust. That's a company who's CEO words are worth something while Elon's at this point is just toilet paper. Guy is not a genius, he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is. This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world. Then he takes all the credit, as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is. You don't need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud, you just need to actually listen what he says and how he's just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says. He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved, the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and ego-driven adventures against OpenAI, , and whomever proved to be better than him at executing. To be complete, here's the list of unmet promises: - $25000 family car: promised in 2006. January 2025 he confirmed production would start, later scrapped the plan in April 2025. - Cheaper models announced late 2024: delayed to prioritize Cybertruck (which was a complete failure) - Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production. Delayed every year since then, new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered. - New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production, Delayed every year since then. - Unsupervised full self driving in Austin: promised by June 2025, still not achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size. - Large-scale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles: bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far. - Self-delivering teslas: promised by 2019, never realized. IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER I'm not saying you should sell. Just stay informed, read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock. You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk, knowing there's a history of missing deadlines, promises and flip-flop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail. The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true, but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon. Ignore people with aggressive ideas, they are just desperate Read the comments, you’ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts.

      "selftext_processed": "You dont need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musks LIES . Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla . Let ’ s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed . Feel free to verify each statement yourself Long story short Burry said has an history of going allin in whatever sounds cool rarely following up on promises and that competition wins . Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 20202021 . He then moved to fullself driving as its main goal but Google ’ s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4 . Tesla 20 cars that still need supervision level 2 but hear me out hes gon na DOUBLE it to 40 by late December . Ready for the misleading headlines Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network So after failing with this he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots . Last year he promised by the end of this year hed produce 5000 robots . Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that ’ s just what he dies . He got his Trillion dollar package hes good . In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality ... so as Burry said the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elons total addressable market . Now I personally dont trust a management who doesnt offer reliable projections . When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up . Just take note for each company of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters set it on your calendar to check back on it and you ’ ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don ’ t have time to listenread all of the guidance copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious never_overpromises and often overdelivers . Thats a company you can trust . Thats a company whos CEO words are worth something while Elons at this point is just toilet paper . Guy is not_a genius he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is . This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world . Then he takes all the credit as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is . You dont need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud you just need to actually listen what he says and how hes just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says . He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and egodriven adventures against OpenAI and whomever proved to be better than him at executing . To be complete heres the list of unmet promises $ 25000 family car promised in 2006 . January 2025 he confirmed production would start later scrapped the plan in April 2025 . Cheaper models announced late 2024 delayed to prioritize Cybertruck which was a complete failure Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production . Delayed every year since then new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered . New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production Delayed every year since then . Unsupervised full self driving in Austin promised by June 2025 still not_achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size . Largescale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far . Selfdelivering teslas promised by 2019 never_realized . IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER Im not_saying you should sell . Just stay informed read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock . You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk knowing theres a history of missing deadlines promises and flipflop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail . The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon . Ignore people with aggressive ideas they are just desperate Read the comments you ’ ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts . Stay safe stay invested Credits to Ettore Mihaili from Netherlands"

      "selftext": "Anthropic has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to begin work on one of the largest initial public offerings ever, which could come as soon as 2026, as the artificial intelligence start-up races OpenAI to the public market. The maker of the Claude chatbot, which is in talks for a private funding round that would value it at more than $300bn, chose the US west coast law firm in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, had also discussed a potential IPO with big investment banks, according to multiple people with knowledge of those talks. The people characterised the discussions as preliminary and informal, suggesting that the company was not close to picking its IPO underwriters. Nonetheless, these moves represent a significant step up in Anthropic’s preparations for an IPO that would test the appetite of public markets to back the massive, lossmaking research labs at the heart of the AI boom. Wilson Sonsini has advised Anthropic since 2022, including on multibillion-dollar investments from Amazon, and has worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft. Its investors are enthusiastic about an IPO, arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first. Sources: FINANCIAL TIMES/ Reuter",

      "selftext": "While commercial property may go vacant somewhere, its rising in profit elseware. Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease. In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years. But unlike a shop in a mall, such as dillards or sears - simon is much less exposed than people think. The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use - the mall near me for example, houses a city police unit and a church. Im not looking at this from a consumer perspective - instead seeing it as an investment in best-in-class commercial real estate and adaptable management. The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary - as value was lost over speculative concern regarding e-commerce and terrifs. Which as seen in the earnings report, was almost a non factor. The stock fell due to irrelevant fud, and is due to make returns to its original trend line. 220-250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term, and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory, its already a proven success.. Cliff: SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no direct stake in the success of retail - its an asset management company, not a clothing store.",

Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease . In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years . But unlike a shop in a mall such as dillards or sears simon is much less exposed than people think . The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not_in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use the mall near me for example houses a city police unit and a church . Im not_looking at this from a consumer perspective instead seeing it as an investment in bestinclass commercial real estate and adaptable management . The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary as value was lost over speculative concern regarding ecommerce and terrifs . Which as seen in the earnings report was almost a non factor . The stock fell due to irrelevant fud and is due to make returns to its original trend line . 220250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory its already a proven success .. Cliff SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no_direct stake in the success of retail its an asset management company not_a clothing store ."

In this inflationary speculative environment AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, are all given premium valuations with 40-120x pe and can still be considered fair value. TSMC is sitting at a \"healthy\" tech sector pe of anywhere around 28-30 day to day.

Their revenues, margins, growth is exemplary and honestly criminally undervalued in such a inflationary AI environment. Are there any other reasons besides hostilities from China why TSMC hasnt gone side by side with Nvidia in growth? I'm No analyst and really am your every day idiot retail investor who absolutely fucking loves to by high sell low.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%. A little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up. But, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? Thank you!",

But I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later . I ’ m wondering if it ’ s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns or if there are other factors I should consider . Maybe it is best to do some of both Thank you"

      "selftext": "Just wanted to double check my understanding on selling a treasury bond that has increased in value. (I’ve previously always just held to maturity). Hold to maturity: Income is state/local tax free. Sell the bond for a profit on the secondary market: Income is effectively a short term capital gain where both state/local and federal taxes apply. So in California where my state taxes are ~10%, I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10% lower than the secondary market price. Is my understanding correct here?",

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank. “We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting. Last week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting. “I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.” Trump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas. The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.” However, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell. For months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively. Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years. In September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer. The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "selftext": "The Verge, Dec 2, 2025 Google’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off. The tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in. In the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said. There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development. The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.

Vultr (backed by AMD) is investing over $1 billion in Ohio to build a 50MW AI chip cluster that will use AMD's AI processors.

This could be a real alternative for startups and small AI teams that can't afford NVIDIA's cloud platform. The facility is scheduled to be operational in Q1 2026.

      "selftext": "Stock certificate help Hi there, I was going through my dad's items and I found a stock certificate from 1999 when he was working with the company. I am trying to cash it out in his name (he has medical problems, and still alive), and the bank said that it needs to be digitized; no problem. I got the forms to get it digitized from Computershare, however I still have questions. According to computershare I have to send it to them in the states (the actual certificate), and I think make an account for him-which I did (the people were not helpful at all). I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form: a letter of authorization to transfer security to non-register account. So my question is should I still send the certificate to computer share along with the the paperwork or should I just send the certificate to the bank he using now?",

      "selftext": "I've read the books about investments like \"The Simple Path to Wealth\" and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people, performance, reputation, sales. Or rather *MADE* sense, back those days when not your every neighbor was an \"investor\" with a collection of stocks on their apps. And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not so well. Now coming to our days: people just invest monthly into MAG7/S&P500/etc doesn't matter are they doing good or bad(just look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation). Americans do their 401k, Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks. This is a huge and constant inflow of money. That is *NOT* based on any analysis, but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this, trying to escape inflation losses and get rich. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x. This is an enormous inflation. It's common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi. Now could you shed a light, how stock markets are different in a broad sense, if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier? **EDIT** Thanks to everyone for the answers, maybe I should've worded it clearer that my misconception/assumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index (like the S&P 500), they aren't looking at the individual stock's value. The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis, making it seem like a closed loop - a \"Ponzi scheme\" where the only buyers are the index funds themselves. u/[stuporman86]( and others brought great points here, that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here: \\- funds vs direct holdings: even though passive funds recently exceeded 50% of the money held in investment funds, funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment. The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings. This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching, selecting, and trading individual stocks and it' is crucial for setting prices based on value, not just automated buying. \\- economic studies suggest that a \"slim minority\" of informed, active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive read the books about investments like The Simple Path to Wealth and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people performance reputation sales . Or rather MADE sense back those days when not_your every neighbor was an investor with a collection of stocks on their apps . And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not_so well . Now coming to our days people just invest monthly into MAG7SP500etc doesnt matter are they doing good or badjust look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation . Americans do their 401k Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks . This is a huge and constant inflow of money . That is NOT based on any analysis but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this trying to escape inflation losses and get rich . Pricetoearnings PE ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x . This is an enormous inflation . Its common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi . Now could you shed a light how stock markets are different in a broad sense if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier EDIT Thanks to everyone for the answers maybe I shouldve worded it clearer that my misconceptionassumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index like the SP 500 they arent looking at the individual stocks value . The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis making it seem like a closed loop a Ponzi scheme where the only buyers are the index funds themselves . ustuporman86 and others brought great points here that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here funds vs direct holdings even though passive funds recently exceeded 50 % of the money held in investment funds funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment . The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings . This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching selecting and trading individual stocks and it is crucial for setting prices based on value not_just automated buying . economic studies suggest that a slim minority of informed active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery"

      "title": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout",
      "selftext": "Disclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows: Since inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues: -Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators. -Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders. -Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better. -Ad stack worst-in-class. -Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure. -Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power. -Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe. SNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below: -Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense. -Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers. -They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue. -They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide. SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive. What investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout. Regarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come. As for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results. In conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclosure long 250000 shares at $ 7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike postQ3 earnings making about $ 200k . However I now look at SNAP as more of a longerterm investment and my thesis follows Since inception SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can ’ t make money which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do . It faces the following issues Founders control the voting rights and haven ’ t been the best capital allocators . Egregious stockbased comp has diluted shareholders . Best features like Stories copied by META and monetized much better . Ad stack worstinclass . Very high operating costs mainly due to infrastructure . Young users hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power . Growing fast mainly in lowincome countries like Indian and Pakistan yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe . SNAP as Spiegel mentioned recently is at a crossroads . It can die a slow unprofitable death or it can innovate and start to make money for once . It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now and I will mention why below Started offering various subscriptions including Snapchat Memories Storage Lens and Platinum . Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $ 750 million year for now and is growing double digits which is unique among its peers . I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center such as Icloud storage Google etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there . The download and import process isn ’ t that easy and there will be friction . A certain number of users will say “ screw it I ’ ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it ” . Meanwhile the users that do not_pay for it will be limited in storage thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense . Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement . After all what use is having hordes of users if you can not make money off of them Sometimes you indeed have to “ fire ” your customers . They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature as well as Sponsored Snaps with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages . The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not_vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue . They recently reorganized into small nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy . The Snapchat success was created by a small team for example so they decided to scale this operationally companywide . SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “ thing ” I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology . They have the most used AR products in the world and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year . Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves which is also a positive as I don ’ t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account . Personally I do not_feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success mainly because SNAP has no_record of being successful in hardware . I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well . If they bomb then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward which would also be a positive . What investors need to think about is this How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU SNAP has that yet only has a $ 13 billion market cap . Ideally the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials . Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs a better ads platform and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically . However I ’ m not_playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares and a takeover won ’ t happen unless they want it to happen . More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout . Regarding stockbased comp dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped and while it is still relatively high management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked . They recently announced a $ 500 million buyback and I think we will see more to come . As for the recent $ 400 million Perplexity deal I see it as a oneoff and don ’ t ascribe much value to it for now especially since Evan said they won ’ t sell advertising against the chatbot results . In conclusion I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year . I don ’ t have a target price on the stock per se but it could become a $ 100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should ."

      "selftext": "Honestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking. It’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down. And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice? Idk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

      "selftext": "U.S. stock futures saw a slight uptick on Tuesday, as investors processed weak manufacturing data, rising expectations of a Fed rate cut, and new speculation surrounding who could replace Jerome Powell when his term ends. At the open: • Dow futures: +0.2% • S&P 500 futures: +0.3% • Nasdaq 100 futures: +0.4% The mood is mixed. Manufacturing activity contracted for the ninth consecutive month, signaling persistent pressure across the sector. At the same time, rate-cut bets keep rising futures now price in an 86% probability of a 25 bps cut at next week’s FOMC meeting. Uncertainty is also building around potential candidates to take over the Fed chair position if Powell isn’t renewed. Earnings remain light, with Marvell, MongoDB, Vestis, and Credo drawing attention after their latest results. Meanwhile, tokenized markets continue to move at a very different speed. While traditional markets pause and wait for the Fed, Bitget Stock Futures just surpassed $10 billion in trading volume. Bitget and other plateforme are already running large-scale tokenized stock futures, while the Nasdaq is still waiting on SEC approval before it can offer its own tokenized stock offerings. I’m starting to think that the Fed’s decision next week might matter less for long-term structure than the shift we’re seeing toward tokenized market rails. Source: [",

Currently, the pricing and inventory models within the supply chain suppress prices, which best aligns with downstream interests. Therefore, they have no other choice but to follow this path. However, cyclical patterns will ultimately exert their influence. As one of the world's largest lithium chemical producers, ALB's standing in the lithium and new energy sectors is unquestionable. Compared to many new energy stocks driven by concept speculation, ALB possesses a more solid foundation: global footprint, diversified production capacity, core raw materials, and increased capital accumulation. ALB may experience short-term fluctuations due to market sentiment and lithium price volatility. But has its growth potential and room for expansion truly reached its limit? I believe not necessarily. Such fluctuations might present an opportunity for those who understand ALB to increase holdings or enter the market.Furthermore, for investors willing to tolerate some market volatility, is ALB also a solid choice?",

But has its growth potential and room for expansion truly reached its limit I believe not_necessarily . Such fluctuations might present an opportunity for those who understand ALB to increase holdings or enter the market.Furthermore for investors willing to tolerate some market volatility is ALB also a solid choice"

      "selftext": "Amazon is officially pushing deeper into the AI chip war. Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon. The pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it. But there’s a catch. Trainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet. Iis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

      "selftext": "For various reasons, I am planning on moving my entire portfolio from \"professional management\" currently under an FA to self-management. I have a post-tax account and a pre-tax Traditional IRA. The post-tax account is mainly comprised of ETF's while the pre-tax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks. I want to move the money to something like FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index) with maybe a little bit of FSPSX (Fidelity International Index) for international exposure, and maybe just a touch of FTBFX (Fidelity Total Bond) for balancing purposes - although probably unnecessary right now. Set, forget, and make auto-contributions monthly. Never look at it. This is long term, I am very confident I won't need the money for 20+ years. 1. For the post-tax account, is the easiest (and/or only) way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETF's, withdraw the cash to my bank account, and then re-buy the Index Funds under my self-managed account? I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season. 2. For the Traditional IRA I obviously cannot withdraw the cash, so how would this one work? Thanks.",

      "selftext": "Traditionally, we bought stocks because we believed the companies were undervalued with solid growth potential, and we hoped other investors would eventually recognize the same to drive demand & prices higher together. Or we invested in companies trading at fair value where dividends provided steady, long-term returns. But recently, the dynamics seem to have shifted. It feels like we’re buying simply because we expect prices will always go up - fueled by the endless cycle of liquidity and “cash printing.” This creates a circular loop that price going up is both the cause and effect! It gives me some ponzi-like vibes and makes me nervous. On top of that, modern markets are heavily influenced by algo trading. These systems aren’t evaluating fundamentals at all but reacting to price action, volatility, order flow, and momentum. When algos chase momentum, they basically accelerate both rallies and selloffs, further disconnecting prices from underlying company performance. To conclude my question, fundamentals seem to matter lesser and lesser. Looking ahead, I see two possible futures: 1. The market corrects and shifts back toward fundamentals-driven, conventional trading. I could see Michael Burry and other big shorts betting on this 2. We accept a new normal where fundamentals are permanently down-weighted, and liquidity flows + momentum dominate price action. Honestly it feels like we’re drifting here already because analysts keep using higher and higher P/E targets, and people seem to just accept it. What are your thoughts?",

Or we invested in companies trading at fair value where dividends provided steady longterm returns . But recently the dynamics seem to have shifted . It feels like we ’ re buying simply because we expect prices will always go up fueled by the endless cycle of liquidity and “ cash printing. ” This creates a circular loop that price going up is both the cause and effect It gives me some ponzilike vibes and makes me nervous . On top of that modern markets are heavily influenced by algo trading . These systems aren ’ t evaluating fundamentals at all but reacting to price action volatility order flow and momentum . When algos chase momentum they basically accelerate both rallies and selloffs further disconnecting prices from underlying company performance . To conclude my question fundamentals seem to matter lesser and lesser . Looking ahead I see two possible futures 1 . The market corrects and shifts back toward fundamentalsdriven conventional trading . I could see Michael Burry and other big shorts betting on this 2 . We accept a new normal where fundamentals are permanently downweighted and liquidity flows momentum dominate price action . Honestly it feels like we ’ re drifting here already because analysts keep using higher and higher PE targets and people seem to just accept it . What are your thoughts"

Meanwhile, the rumor mill is heating up: Google’s custom AI chips (TPUs / in-house silicon) might start hitting the broader AI-infrastructure market soon. If Google (or any big tech) begins selling in volume, we could see chip oversupply + falling prices + fierce competition the perfect storm for a big player with dead inventory. That means all those unsold GPUs and AI chips on NVIDIA’s balance sheet could turn into a serious liability leading not just to a stock dip, but possibly a collapse in GPU-driven AI dominance. Would love to hear from folks here: **Do you think this is just panic or a legitimate risk for NVIDIA? If you were building an AI/data-center stack now would you bet on GPUs or wait for custom silicon from Google/others?**",

Meanwhile the rumor mill is heating up Google ’ s custom AI chips TPUs inhouse silicon might start hitting the broader AIinfrastructure market soon . If Google or any big tech begins selling in volume we could see chip oversupply falling prices fierce competition the perfect storm for a big player with dead inventory . That means all those unsold GPUs and AI chips on NVIDIA ’ s balance sheet could turn into a serious liability leading not_just to a stock dip but possibly a collapse in GPUdriven AI dominance . Would love to hear from folks here Do you think this is just panic or a legitimate risk for NVIDIA If you were building an AIdatacenter stack now would you bet on GPUs or wait for custom silicon from Googleothers"

      "selftext": "\"NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share.\" --- The Synopsis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software runs on Intel and AMD CPUs. This chess move by NVDA will shift the R&D hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs, thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA. The rest of the Mag7 (AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL and TSLA) are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon (Trainium, M-series, MTIA, Maia, TPU and AI5/6). The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat. Exciting times ahead!",

Take XPeng for example, their earnings have shown consistent growth, yet the stock has struggled to find traction in recent period. It makes me wonder how other investors are thinking about this space. Do you see Chinese EVs as a solid longterm play, betting on continued adoption and tech leadership? Or is the market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty too risky to go longterm? For those holding these stocks, how are you positioning yourself, and which names are you watching most closely in this sector?",

It makes me wonder how other investors are thinking about this space . Do you see Chinese EVs as a solid longterm play betting on continued adoption and tech leadership Or is the market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty too risky to go longterm For those holding these stocks how are you positioning yourself and which names are you watching most closely in this sector"

      "selftext": "# Today, December 2nd, 2025 Hello again, it's the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the S&P500 is going to be positive for the year. I now have $18,421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $10,000 into it via the mega-backdoor method. I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $10,000 extra being converted in, but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback. Before the rebalance, accounting for the $10,000 coming in, my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions, which is basically no leverage. After rebalancing, my leverage sat near 2.2x. Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down. For this quarter I'm actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being. The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73% per Aswath Damodaran from NYU. Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below, it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below <4%. The authors did not explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4%, but it is pretty implied. How this impacts my performance in the long term is not known as this was not evaluated by the authors at the time of the book's publication. Unfortunately, this de-leverage change is occurring after a pullback, which can hurt my short-term performance, but in the long run it should all equal out (hopefully). Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information, not driven by fear or greed, suggests otherwise. Background * Currently 28 years old Reasons: 1. Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage. 2. The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0% invested into stocks by saying that in today's times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium (which I believe sits around 5% depending on which source you use) to determine whether to de-leverage. 1. In general, when the equity risk premium is <3% this indicates bonds may be a better investment, 4-6% suggests a 60/40 or a 70/30 stock to bond allocation, and >6% suggests potentially having a 100% stock portfolio. You will generally only see >6% during market downturns or recessions. 3. I am 28 years old. At this age per the book, I should still maintain my 2x leverage, however given the equity risk premium of <4%, I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being. Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy. Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise. That's all for this quarter, see you in March. \\--- Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months). [ Performance: Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64 Current investment: $18,421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far: Processing $10,161 Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement. **What Is Lifecycle Investing?** Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk. How to do this: * First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share. * Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs * Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real estate and cash as retirement nears. * Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter. Essentially, you're looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x **My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation** 06/2025: With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also, you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). **Plan** * Quarterly Recalculation: * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share. * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s. 1. De-leverage Schedule: * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage. * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase. * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation. * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches. **Risk Management and Contingencies** * Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage. * Market extremes: ~~If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.~~ * Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors. * Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal. **Summary** I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28-year-old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years. **Extensive Summary** I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Today December 2nd 2025 Hello again its the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the SP500 is going to be positive for the year . I now have $ 18421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $ 10000 into it via the megabackdoor method . I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $ 10000 extra being converted in but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback . Before the rebalance accounting for the $ 10000 coming in my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions which is basically no_leverage . After rebalancing my leverage sat near 2.2x . Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down . For this quarter Im actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being . The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73 % per Aswath Damodaran from NYU . Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below 4 % . The authors did not_explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4 % but it is pretty implied . How this impacts my performance in the long term is not_known as this was not_evaluated by the authors at the time of the books publication . Unfortunately this deleverage change is occurring after a pullback which can hurt my shortterm performance but in the long run it should all equal out hopefully . Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information not_driven by fear or greed suggests otherwise . Background Currently 28 years old Reasons 1 . Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage . 2 . The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0 % invested into stocks by saying that in todays times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium which I believe sits around 5 % depending on which source you use to determine whether to deleverage . 1 . In general when the equity risk premium is 3 % this indicates bonds may be a better investment 46 % suggests a 6040 or a 7030 stock to bond allocation and 6 % suggests potentially having a 100 % stock portfolio . You will generally only see 6 % during market downturns or recessions . 3 . I am 28 years old . At this age per the book I should still maintain my 2x leverage however given the equity risk premium of 4 % I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being . Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy . Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise . Thats all for this quarter see you in March . Please see below for the current information regarding the trade . Which I will be updating every quarter every 3 months . Performance Initial investment June 2025 $ 15611.64 Current investment $ 18421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far Processing $ 10161 Below I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement . What Is Lifecycle Investing Lifecycle investing by Ayres and Nalebuff argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth including future earnings is much larger than their current savings . Since most young investors have little capital available for investment but decades of future earnings they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans . As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal you should gradually reduce risk . How to do this First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share . Use leverage through either margin leveraged ETFs or deepinthemoney LEAPs Reduce leverage over time shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bondsreal estate and cash as retirement nears . Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter . Essentially youre looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation 062025 With only $ 15000 in my Roth IRA I can ’ t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in 2 years at the 300 strike price . So instead I ’ ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150 . VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase . Unfortunately VTI doesn ’ t offer options that expire 2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close . Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50 % of the underlying cost roughly 50 % of the ETF ’ s trading price mirroring 2x leverage . Ideally when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro Emini futures then Eminis as from an cost standpoint they actually cost the least as outlined in the book . Also you get the additional benefit of them not_expiring at least in the same way options do . Plan Quarterly Recalculation Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share . Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s . 1 . Deleverage Schedule Ages 27–30 Maintain 2x leverage . Ages 30–40 Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase . Ages 4050 Transition to a 1x unleveraged total equity allocation . Ages 50–59.5 Begin incorporating bondsreal estate and cash shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches . Risk Management and Contingencies Time decay I ’ ll monitor the LEAP ’ s theta and if rollover costs or time decay become excessive consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage . Market extremes If the cyclically adjusted PE CAPE ratio spikes above historical thresholds I may temporarily deleverage to 1x1.5x rather than fully exit equities . Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time . I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence . Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors . Rebalancing frequency I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal . Summary I ’ m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28yearold . Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments . Over the next decade I ’ ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears . Theoretically speaking over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years . Extensive Summary I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free"

      "title": "24 beginning my investing journey",
      "selftext": "Hi all, As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions. I currently make ~ 95k and live at home with parents, I don’t pay rent, but I do pay $1000/ month towards my car payment (took a loan from family, will be fully paid off in 8 months, after which I’ll have no “expenses” per se) Now regarding my investment journey, I’ll start of by saying all the research I’ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA, so I’ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO. I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago, contributing 10% with a 5% employer match. Now the above retirement savings which I won’t be able to touch until I’m older, but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well? Is that even possible without risk? I am willing to invest $1000 monthly, is it best to just invest all of it in ETF’s? Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF’s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I’m doing with my Roth IRA. I don’t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $800 towards an ETF and $200 towards company stocks be a smart move? Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account, my understanding is that the benefits of this are: no limit on how much you can invest yearly, and withdraw your contributions anytime tax /penalty free, is my understanding of this correct? Thank you for any answers and advice!",

I currently make 95k and live at home with parents I don ’ t pay rent but I do pay $ 1000 month towards my car payment took a loan from family will be fully paid off in 8 months after which I ’ ll have no_ “ expenses ” per se Now regarding my investment journey I ’ ll start of by saying all the research I ’ ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA so I ’ ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO . I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago contributing 10 % with a 5 % employer match . Now the above retirement savings which I won ’ t be able to touch until I ’ m older but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well Is that even possible without risk I am willing to invest $ 1000 monthly is it best to just invest all of it in ETF ’ s Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF ’ s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I ’ m doing with my Roth IRA . I don ’ t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $ 800 towards an ETF and $ 200 towards company stocks be a smart move Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account my understanding is that the benefits of this are no_limit on how much you can invest yearly and withdraw your contributions anytime tax penalty free is my understanding of this correct Thank you for any answers and advice"

Pay tied to performance no_stupid golden parachute and strong alignment with long term shareholders . The Street actually likes that . • Amazon vans still matter . Even slower volume keeps production lines alive and predictable . • Costs coming down . They ’ re not_lighting money on fire like before . Manufacturing efficiency is getting real . • Brand is strong as hell . R1 owners hype the product nonstop which is basically free marketing . I am going full regard"

      "selftext": "in my opinion, a low ROE does not mean a weak business and a high ROE does not always mean a strong one. For example Im taking UCL case (uCloudlink). Their ROE 8.7%, not really impressive but their fundamentals looks very interesting. Their EPS grew 85% over the past year, net income expanded 60% in five years and the stock up to almost 50% in 12 months. According to these numbers, I can see that their growth is outpacing than what their ROE reflects. Recently, their price drop a bit but when we looking into a long term and as Benjamin Graham said: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine\". This shows that ROE didnt capture the full earnings of a stock.",

      "title": "SEZL DD pt.2: BNPL, the most misunderstood industry",
      "selftext": "[My original DD for SEZL is here]( Previous post if you haven't seen it yet \\^, little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL: **BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now. It's not nearly as irresponsible or \"set to blow up\" as the general sentiment makes it out to be.** 1. Standard loan tenor of Sezzle's BNPL average 40-50 days, with AOVs being $100-250. 2. BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx. 2% versus Credit Cards at 10%. People use Sezzle for groceries, gas, and other essentials/semi-essentials. Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs. 3. Sezzle does NOT make money off of defaulting consumers! The long-term value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time. They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition - again, short-term pain for long term customer filtering. 4. Limits and product usage can be changed instantly, versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice. Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time. 5. CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzle's target base is already low-mid income; consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance. **6. Management from Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, Zip (BNPL providers) all noted no negative changes in repayment ability - Affirm CEO actually noted that govt. workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise.** 7. Points 1-6 point to the low-risk of these loans compared to CCs, Auto, Mortgages etc. due to the nature of their AOV + importance to the consumer. 8. The misconception that \"people will stop paying their BNPL loans first\". ZERO data to suggest this. Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario, along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs. People would much rather pay off the $100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever. 9. Sezzle offers optional credit-reporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour, along with their tier program. **What has overshadowed the share price as of late?** 1. Liquidity risk-off from high-beta stocks in recent weeks (late Oct-now) 2. Rising delinquency rates that were guided for, in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment & shaky macro news. Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2% to 3% in recent quarter, BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.5-2.75%, from original guide of 2.5-3%. 3. Compressed net margin from 28% Q2 to 23% Q3 - mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates, again, were guided for at start of the year. Should not be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product (subscriptions versus one-time use card). Expecting 25-27.5% stable net margin for 2026. There is SOME real concern here but not scary enough to lose conviction IMO. **Why I believe upside is 100% from here (6m+ hold)** 1. Re-shift to subscription mid Q3 netted +80,000 active subscribers. Assume minimum 120,000/Q add for the next 3-4 quarters: this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR, as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins. Their previous focus in Q1-3 was a lower margin, less sticky product which proved to not be as beneficial, hence the switch. Will be a $15M+ figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q1-2026. 1.5. Active consumers expected to grow @ 4-6% QoQ & payback period of 6-9 months on marketing spend (8M/quarter) will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters & beyond. 2. Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant \"fear\" classification. The fears are not completely unwarranted, but for the most part, blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space. This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour. 3. Continued penetration of consumer acquisition + general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users, and consequently revenue. 4. Trading at 14 NTM P/E growing at 60% YoY revenue & Net Income. History of earnings double beat. 5. Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged - management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentiment/repayment ability is low. Anticipating this to be closer to 4.5-5. 6. As bad as it may sound, their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials - cutting this service out of the user's life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it. End of the day, no different from a Credit Card. 7. Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners. *Conclusion: QE begins, market sentiment changes to \"BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears\", company performance will continue to deliver, and multiple expansion will persist to re-rate the company closer to 20-25x NTM P/E.* BASE case: assuming 20-25x NTM P/E: EPS 5.5 NTM @ May 2026: SP of $110-137.50. BULL case (short/gamma squeeze, unlikely, but happened May 2025): 35-40x NTM P/E, $200+ possible. UNLIKELY by EOY2026. **Positions have rotated into 800 shares. Options IV is way too high @ 90%.**",

BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx . 2 % versus Credit Cards at 10 % . People use Sezzle for groceries gas and other essentialssemiessentials . Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs . 3 . Sezzle does NOT_make money off of defaulting consumers The longterm value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time . They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition again shortterm pain for long term customer filtering . 4 . Limits and product usage can be changed instantly versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice . Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time . 5 . CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzles target base is already lowmid income consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance . 6 . Management from Affirm Klarna Sezzle Zip BNPL providers all noted no_negative changes in repayment ability Affirm CEO actually noted that govt . workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise . 7 . Points 16 point to the lowrisk of these loans compared to CCs Auto Mortgages etc . due to the nature of their AOV importance to the consumer . 8 . The misconception that people will stop paying their BNPL loans first . ZERO data to suggest this . Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs . People would much rather pay off the $ 100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever . 9 . Sezzle offers optional creditreporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour along with their tier program . What has overshadowed the share price as of late 1 . Liquidity riskoff from highbeta stocks in recent weeks late Octnow 2 . Rising delinquency rates that were guided for in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment shaky macro news . Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2 % to 3 % in recent quarter BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.52.75 % from original guide of 2.53 % . 3 . Compressed net margin from 28 % Q2 to 23 % Q3 mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates again were guided for at start of the year . Should not_be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product subscriptions versus onetime use card . Expecting 2527.5 % stable net margin for 2026 . There is SOME real concern here but not_scary enough to lose conviction IMO . Why I believe upside is 100 % from here 6m hold 1 . Reshift to subscription mid Q3 netted 80000 active subscribers . Assume minimum 120000Q add for the next 34 quarters this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins . Their previous focus in Q13 was a lower margin less sticky product which proved to not_be as beneficial hence the switch . Will be a $ 15M figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q12026 . 1.5 . Active consumers expected to grow 46 % QoQ payback period of 69 months on marketing spend 8Mquarter will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters beyond . 2 . Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant fear classification . The fears are not_completely unwarranted but for the most part blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space . This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour . 3 . Continued penetration of consumer acquisition general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users and consequently revenue . 4 . Trading at 14 NTM PE growing at 60 % YoY revenue Net Income . History of earnings double beat . 5 . Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentimentrepayment ability is low . Anticipating this to be closer to 4.55 . 6 . As bad as it may sound their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials cutting this service out of the users life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it . End of the day no_different from a Credit Card . 7 . Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners . Conclusion QE begins market sentiment changes to BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears company performance will continue to deliver and multiple expansion will persist to rerate the company closer to 2025x NTM PE . BASE case assuming 2025x NTM PE EPS 5.5 NTM May 2026 SP of $ 110137.50 . BULL case shortgamma squeeze unlikely but happened May 2025 3540x NTM PE $ 200 possible . UNLIKELY by EOY2026 . Positions have rotated into 800 shares . Options IV is way too high 90 % ."

Unless it's critical, I'll not say who I'm investing through just yet. One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they cannot change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago. I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments. If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases, I'm going to have a massive tax load. If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases, I may actually be showing a loss. This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest, like next year when I'll be retired and have no salary income to report for the year.",

One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they can not change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago . I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments . If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases Im going to have a massive tax load . If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases I may actually be showing a loss . This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest like next year when Ill be retired and have no_salary income to report for the year ."

      "selftext": "Apple’s head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, will step down from his position, the company announced on Monday. The move is the most visible shakeup in Apple’s artificial intelligence group since the company announced Apple Intelligence, its AI software suite, in 2024. Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026. Giannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile. Subramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring. In a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive. “In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said. Source: [",

In 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago]( I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M. [Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains]( That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios: [I \\(blue\\) am +263&#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&#37; over that time period]( The account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided. Summary: \\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin. \\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.** [Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options]( Q&A 1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?* \\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this? 2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?* \\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017. *3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?* \\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

In 6 months the account grew another $ 470K so Im at $ 1.5M of total gains since my first post 5 and a half years ago I did withdraw $ 250K to buy a new home so the account sits at $ 2.3M . Ending Net Deposits $ 1.5M in gains Thats a 27 % compound return a year for nearly 6 years . I continue to crush regular rstock boomer index fund portfolios I blue am 26337 while stocks green are barely 10037 over that time period The account has $ 7.3M assets and $ 5M borrowed in options so thats 3.2x leverage . Im underleveraged I know . The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $ 2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage . I havent decided . Summary Borrow 24x the value of your account on margin . Dump it all in a multiasset diversified portfolio . For the stock sleeve I prefer smartbeta funds due to their higher expected returns . The goal is maximum compound returns . Positions Stocks bonds mutual funds and $ 5M borrowed in Box Spread Options QA 1 When will you deleverpayoff the debtliquidate Never_This maximizes returns . Why do anything but this 2 Whats it like for your account to grow $ 1M per year Its cool you should try it . Save what you can invest it like this and give it time . I started with just $ 20K in 2017 . 3 Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere I have every penny riding in here . Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27 % per year so why do that"

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "selftext": "“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders. Burry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market. He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution. Burry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards. Tesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

      "selftext_processed": "“ Big Short ” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter calling the electricvehicle maker “ ridiculously overvalued ” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern . Burry argued that Tesla ’ s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no_buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders . Burry cited Tesla ’ s SEC filings showing that the company ’ s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7 % over the past several years driven primarily by stockbased compensation and past equity raises . Tesla ’ s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a splitadjusted basis following the company ’ s 5for1 stock split in 2020 and 3for1 split in 2022 both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market . He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period including two $ 5 billion atthemarket ATM raises in September and December 2020 followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $ 12 billion in new equity issuance . These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company ’ s float and remain a key driver of longterm dilution . Burry also referenced Tesla ’ s most recent quarterly filings which reported over $ 1.7 billion in stockbased compensation SBC expense yeartodate resulting in a continual increase in the weightedaverage share count used for earnings calculations . Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure including multiyear performancebased awards . Tesla has no_active sharebuyback program and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained freecashflow levels . Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equitylinked programs ."

      "title": "A Closer Look At What Nvidia’s Numbers Might Be Suggesting",
      "selftext": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again, and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about. The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not look isolated at all. A 1% to 1.8% decline might seem manageable, but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time, it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals. The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this. Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback, I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup. Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high. Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising. That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me. What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt. Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia’s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path. If that is true, how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia’s long term revenue structure? Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue? Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory. They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320. A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious. Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia’s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle. The insider activity adds another layer entirely. Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day, totaling 9924868, with an average value of about 661657 each. The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern. The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher. It does not necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions. She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not a withdrawal of confidence, but it is a moment that makes you look twice. Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys. Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem. It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype. So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another. A stock sliding with its sector. A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not explosive. Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets. Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that cannot just be ignored. And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing. The question I keep coming back to is simple. Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more. I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about . The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not_look isolated at all . A 1 % to 1.8 % decline might seem manageable but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals . The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this . Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup . Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no_trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high . Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising . That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me . What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt . Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia ’ s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path . If that is true how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia ’ s long term revenue structure Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory . They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320 . A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious . Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia ’ s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle . The insider activity adds another layer entirely . Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day totaling 9924868 with an average value of about 661657 each . The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern . The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher . It does not_necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions . She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not_a withdrawal of confidence but it is a moment that makes you look twice . Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys . Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem . It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype . So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another . A stock sliding with its sector . A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not_explosive . Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets . Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that can not just be ignored . And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing . The question I keep coming back to is simple . Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more . I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next ."

It’s kind of sneaky but genius. Plus they have YouTube, Maps, Search… the amount of data they can train on is ridiculous. It’s hard to compete with that.

      "selftext": "Rough close today Dow down almost 1%, S&P and Nasdaq red too. Felt like the whole market just dragged its feet all day. What caught my eye though was BABA actually showing some life for once, up more than 4%. I haven t seen that stock stretch its legs in a while. Meanwhile AVGO took a hit, and NVDA/AAPL bounced a bit, which honestly feels like the usual “tech rotation but not really” type of day. I don t have a big China position right now, but moves like this always make me wonder if these little green sparks are just noise or the early signs of something shifting. Hard to tell with how moody the market s been. Anyone else watching BABA or is this just another one day head fake? Curious how you all are positioning with this weird mix of red indices random pockets of strength.",

What caught my eye though was BABA actually showing some life for once up more than 4 % . I haven t seen that stock stretch its legs in a while . Meanwhile AVGO took a hit and NVDAAAPL bounced a bit which honestly feels like the usual “ tech rotation but not_really ” type of day . I don t have a big China position right now but moves like this always make me wonder if these little green sparks are just noise or the early signs of something shifting . Hard to tell with how moody the market s been . Anyone else watching BABA or is this just another one day head fake Curious how you all are positioning with this weird mix of red indices random pockets of strength ."

      "selftext": "🚨🚨 BARRICK MINING (GOLD CHAD OF THE CENTURY) DD 🚨🚨 aka: Why $GOLD is about to melt faces harder than a 1999 dot-com chart but with ACTUAL PROFITS Listen up you smooth-brained degenerates who think “diversification” means buying calls AND puts on the same ticker. I bring you THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The One True DD. The post that will make your future grandchildren ask, “Grandpa, how did you become disgustingly wealthy?” And you’ll just whisper… “Barrick, my child.” ⸻ 💰 THE SETUP: BARRICK IS PRIMED TO GO GOD MODE Here’s what’s cooking hotter than Mali during the wet season: 1️⃣ S&P500 Inclusion → +$10 share price Index funds will have to buy this like a boomer panic-buying toilet paper in 2020. Guaranteed forced buying = tendies. 2️⃣ Analyst Price Targets Averaging $46 Wall Street FINALLY woke up from their coke-coma and realized Barrick isn’t some penny stock miner digging with spoons. 3️⃣ FOURMILE MINE = THE NEVADA GIGACHAD • Literally the #1 best mine discovery of our generation • Doesn’t require double fraction processing like the other peasant mines • Single fraction extraction = lower cost = higher profit = more stonk go up This thing prints gold like a stimmy printer in 2020. 4️⃣ Mali Resolution → +$10 share price No more geopolitical headache. Add another $10 because peace = profits. 5️⃣ Production Increasing 6% Every Year Imagine a miner that actually grows instead of declining like your OTM calls. Wild. ⸻ 🪙 THE GOLD MATH (YES, I DID MATH. YOU’RE WELCOME.) At different gold prices, Barrick is basically a cheat code: • $55 share price @ $3300 gold • $65 @ $3700 • Bank of America says $4000 gold by end of 2025 • $75 @ $4000 • $85 @ $4300 • $95 @ $4600 • $110 @ $5000 Gold going up? Barrick prints money. Gold going sideways? Barrick prints money. Gold going down? Barrick STILL prints money because Fourmile is basically a money-spitting dragon. ⸻ 📈 NOW THE JUICY PART Starting valuation: $55/share at $4000 gold Every +100 in gold price = +$3.5/share Current gold price in your note? $4200 gold. That means: • $55 base • +$10 from Mali • +$7 from the gold price difference 🔥 = $72/share conservative value right now 🔥 Market currently pricing Barrick like it’s a grandma with a metal detector, not a global gold emperor with the best mine in Nevada. ⸻ 🚀 TL;DR FOR THE ADHD AUTISTS • S&P inclusion = forced buying • Fourmile mine = god-tier print factory • Mali drama resolved • Analysts already behind the curve • Gold trending up • Barrick undervalued harder than Bitcoin at $200 Target: $72 short-term. $110+ if gold hits $5k. ⸻ 🦍💎 FINAL THOUGHTS 💎🦍 This isn’t a meme stock. This is the anti-meme stock. This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman. This is free money with a shovel. The WSB play isn’t to YOLO weeklies — it’s to buy, hold, and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion. GOLD TO THE MOON. BARRICK TO VALHALLA. I am not a financial advisor. I am, however, extremely bullish and slightly intoxicated. Positions Below ya regards, screenshot for proof 35C january 2027 40C january 2027",

      "selftext": "Lately I've been looking at Bitcoin after the recent 30% drop and considering it as a potential place to start building a position. I've got around 10k set aside for investing and I'm still pretty new to the whole process, so I've been trying to get a better sense of how different assets behave during pullbacks. Bitcoin in particular has caught my attention. I've been comparing a couple of charts that seem to give completely different signals-one points toward a possible end of the sell-off, while the other looks like there's still room for more downside. It's been interesting trying to make sense of how conflicting indicators can coexist and what that says about market sentiment overall. Just putting my thoughts together as I watch how things develop and try to understand the bigger picture around BTC and the current market environment Charts",

Bitcoin in particular has caught my attention . Ive been comparing a couple of charts that seem to give completely different signalsone points toward a possible end of the selloff while the other looks like theres still room for more downside . Its been interesting trying to make sense of how conflicting indicators can coexist and what that says about market sentiment overall .

      "selftext": "# RGTI Insiders still selling Latest sells were on 21-Nov by CFO and CTO. CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $12/share [openinsider]( And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue, what are insiders doing? Still selling. The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company. Zero. Some people defend this by saying he has stock options, but that is not the same as owning the stock. For a company this young and unproven, a leader should have skin in the game. The people running this company are cashing out, not buying in. The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits. # $1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $12-$15 range is the right play, and the latest 10-Q report proves my point. I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025, and the business is actually getting worse. Their revenue for the last nine months was only $5.2 million. That is a massive drop from the $8.5 million they made in the same period last year. A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag. So how are they staying alive? By printing a ridiculous number of new shares. They burned through over $41 million in cash in just nine months. To cover that, they sold nearly $347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering. They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself cannot generate enough cash. This is not a sign of a healthy company; it is a sign of continuing desperation. # Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Here's RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025: [ ..and Mckinsey & Co.: position 250 RGTZ - (inverse w/ 2x leverage)",

      "selftext": "Everytime the yield curve inverts, we get a lot of youtube videos where they fear monger using this fact. When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens, that's when historically, recessions have happened. The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break, and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession. This time however, the yield curve has come out of inversion (barely) and will either go up, or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up (in which case they say that the recession is assured). Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85% I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat, maybe there won't be a recession. Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession. At this point in time, based on the data we have, what do you think is most likely to happen (regarding the rate cuts, unemployment numbers, and the likelihood of a recession)?",

When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens thats when historically recessions have happened . The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession . This time however the yield curve has come out of inversion barely and will either go up or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up in which case they say that the recession is assured . Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85 % I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat maybe there wont be a recession . Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession . At this point in time based on the data we have what do you think is most likely to happen regarding the rate cuts unemployment numbers and the likelihood of a recession"

Some so called AI concept stocks have run their course while others still appear incredibly strong . Currently Im primarily focusing on companies that are actually delivering products and addressing genuine market demand rather than just peddling trendy concepts . Some AI stocks appear poised for further gains in 2026 but Im more interested in seeing which stocks others are watching . In the final month of 2025 which AI stocks do you genuinely favor"

      "selftext": "I don't think now is a good time to sell stocks. Personally, I would continue to accumulate the following stocks when prices dip: 1) RDDT: An exceptional AI + community company with outstanding revenue and profits this year. I consider it the top community app currently. Moving averages are converging and poised for an upward breakout. Keep adding. 2) BE: A clean energy company. Third-quarter earnings were exceptionally strong, far exceeding expectations, and it secured major contracts with Oracle and Brookfield. I believe the key to AI's true takeoff lies in whether power supply can keep pace. Otherwise, no matter how many Nvidia chips are purchased or how many data centers are built, it won't matter. I consider BE a leader in this field. Continue 3) EOSE: Provides long-duration energy storage battery solutions. Q3 earnings were exceptionally strong, with a current order backlog valued at billions of dollars. It possesses superior growth potential compared to peers. Recommend continuing to add to positions. Additionally: CRCL and NVO are currently undervalued at their current prices and warrant investment. Their long-term recovery is merely a matter of time. The above conclusions stem from my trading strategy and models, primarily applied to short-term trading and options. My overall current yield stands at approximately 163%. However, regarding the aforementioned stock strategies, I firmly believe their trends “will not change easily.”",

Personally I would continue to accumulate the following stocks when prices dip 1 RDDT An exceptional AI community company with outstanding revenue and profits this year . I consider it the top community app currently . Moving averages are converging and poised for an upward breakout . Keep adding . 2 BE A clean energy company . Thirdquarter earnings were exceptionally strong far exceeding expectations and it secured major contracts with Oracle and Brookfield . I believe the key to AIs true takeoff lies in whether power supply can keep pace . Otherwise no_matter how many Nvidia chips are purchased or how many data centers are built it wont matter . I consider BE a leader in this field . Continue 3 EOSE Provides longduration energy storage battery solutions . Q3 earnings were exceptionally strong with a current order backlog valued at billions of dollars . It possesses superior growth potential compared to peers . Recommend continuing to add to positions . Additionally CRCL and NVO are currently undervalued at their current prices and warrant investment . Their longterm recovery is merely a matter of time . The above conclusions stem from my trading strategy and models primarily applied to shortterm trading and options . My overall current yield stands at approximately 163 % . However regarding the aforementioned stock strategies I firmly believe their trends “ will not_change easily . ”"

My current breakdown looks like this: HYSA: ~$20k saved ($2,650 average monthly cost, 6 month safety accrued) - Saving around $700 per month 401(k): ~$21k invested (investing 4.5% with 100% company match at 4.5%) - Aggressive portfolio type, large cap markets and some mid cap markets only ROTH: ~$17k invested (try to put $540 in monthly, split between 90% S&P, 10% international) Personal Investments: ~$4k invested (mostly S&P with a handful of other stocks) - Investments are sporadic, thinking of cutting half of my savings moving forward and investing (e.g. $350 into HYSA, $350 into personal investments) - Also thinking of taking any interest earned on my HYSA, and putting into personal investments Let me know if there’s anything more I can do! Living in a HCOL city makes things a bit trickier, but want to try to streamline my investment process as much as possible!",

      "selftext": "No paywall: [ NVIDIA and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS) today announced an expanded, strategic partnership to revolutionize design and engineering across industries. R&D teams, from the semiconductor industry to aerospace, automotive, industrial and beyond, face significant engineering challenges including increasing workflow complexity, escalating development costs and time-to-market pressure. This expanded partnership will integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’ market-leading engineering solutions to deliver capabilities enabling R&D teams to design, simulate and verify intelligent products with greater precision, speed and at lower cost. In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. “CUDA GPU-accelerated computing is revolutionizing design — enabling simulation at unprecedented speed and scale, from atoms to transistors, from chips to complete systems, creating fully functional digital twins inside the computer,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design — empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future.” “The complexity and cost of developing next-generation intelligent systems demands engineering solutions with a deeper integration of electronics and physics, accelerated by AI capabilities and compute. No two companies are better positioned to deliver AI-powered, holistic system design solutions than Synopsys and NVIDIA,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. “Together we will re-engineer engineering and empower innovators everywhere to more efficiently realize their innovations.” **Joint Development to Enable Future of Engineering on Accelerated Computing** The multiyear partnership builds on strong, existing technology collaborations between the companies and includes the following initiatives: * **Broadly accelerate Synopsys applications:** Using NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries and AI physics technologies, Synopsys will further accelerate and optimize its broad portfolio of compute-intensive applications spanning chip design, physical verification, molecular simulations, electromagnetic analysis, optical simulation and more. * ​**Advance agentic AI engineering:** Building on the existing AI collaboration to enable agentic AI workflows, the companies are integrating Synopsys AgentEngineer™ technology with the NVIDIA agentic AI technology stack — including NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, NVIDIA NeMo™ Agent Toolkit software and NVIDIA Nemotron™ models — to enable autonomous design capabilities for electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation and analysis workflows. * ​**Connect the physical and digital worlds through digital twins:** The companies will collaborate to enable the next generation of virtual design, testing and validation through the use of highly accurate and sophisticated digital twins for industries such as semiconductor, robotics, aerospace, automotive, energy, industrial, healthcare and beyond. These solutions will utilize NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and other technologies. * ​**Cloud-ready solutions:** Synopsys and NVIDIA plan to make the power of accelerated engineering solutions accessible to engineering teams of all sizes by enabling cloud access for GPU-accelerated engineering solutions. * ​**Develop joint go-to-market initiatives:** To drive market adoption, the companies also have agreed to develop joint go-to-market initiatives to broadly reach engineering teams across multiple industries with both on-premise and cloud-ready solutions. This go-to-market effort will utilize Synopsys’ global network of thousands of direct sellers and channel partners, building on Synopsys’ broad customer base and existing agreement to license, sell and support Omniverse technology embedded in Synopsys simulation solutions. This partnership is not exclusive. NVIDIA and Synopsys continue to partner with the broader semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) ecosystem to create shared growth opportunities for the future of engineering and design.",

      "selftext": "Global equities caught in a tug-of-war: as we roll into December, risk-off vibes are creeping in. \\- Europe’s shares drifted into the red as industrial & defence names weighed on the broader index. \\- Asian markets put in a cautious start. Japan’s Nikkei 225 sank nearly 2% after the Bank of Japan hinted at possible rate hikes \\- U.S. futures slipped as tech wobbled and investors waited for critical Fed and macro cues. \\- Meanwhile, gold and silver edged higher, hinting the “safe-haven” switch is flipping. The rally’s not dead but it’s definitely paused at a crossroads. With big central-bank decisions, macro prints, and seasonal liquidity dynamics converging, every wobble could spark something bigger. So buckle up, If you’re long, stay alert, If you’re hedged, stay ready!",

      "selftext": "I am writing this on my phone. So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes. What IOVA does? Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors. (Roughly over 90%, remaining 10% being Blood) Their product, Amtagvi (lifileucel), is a one-time TIL therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Doctors take T cells from the tumor, Iovance expands them into billions, and those cells get infused back into the patient. Very intuitive, essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer. Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real, durable responses. This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers. Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works. I hold 30,000 shares. 2) Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths. You may have heard of CAR-T but that doesn’t work on them. They only work for blood cancer which is only 10% of TAM, rest being Soldin tumor cancer. Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment, and 2L severely lacking treatment. If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers, the market is massive. Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD. Add cervical, NSCLC, head and neck, ovarian: the upside gets wide quickly. In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications, with several already in late stage phase 3. The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat. And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area. With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment. NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space. No other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is. They have their own manufacturing facilities that’s worth 1 billion USD itself. 3) Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid-2024. Early numbers: • Q2: around $31M • Q3: around $62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter. 70+ treatment centers active or onboarding. Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250-300M range. And management has reiterated their range for EOY. For a ~$1B market cap company, that’s extremely low valuation. 3) Bear Case arguments that don’t hold water Execution: With IOVA bears and shorts never questioned the science but about the execution. I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible. However, they bought in a new CFO (Corleen Roche) in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40% in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption: This was another pain point, during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA. Since, it is a Novel treatment. Patient referrals by Doctors was slow, and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process. In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson (The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies). The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff. Q4 will be explosive. Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write: 1. Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast. If they keep beating, the market re-rates this quickly. Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target. Q4 will be huge for this stock 2. New indications Cervical cancer filing potential. NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval First-line melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3. 3. Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway. (UK is already approved but not announced) Canada already approved. 4. Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time = more patients = more revenue. 5. Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable, any major pharma would want this platform. 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy Long-Term Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors, this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers. The total addressable market becomes enormous. At least $30B and at current share prices that’s $75 per share. Even if you are super bear about this stock at $10 minimum is already better than its current price. Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock. First-in-class advantage, strong early sales, a huge melanoma market, and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers. If they execute, this isn’t a 5 percent upside story. It’s potentially several multiples. This is why I’m long 30K shares. Risks Not sugarcoated: • Manufacturing is complex. • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong. Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail. But highly unlikely given its recent data release. It’s incredible • Volatility is brutal. Shorts have been at this stock with about 35% shorted. However, about 80-90% is owned by Institutions. Big names like Blackrock, GS , etc.. • They’ve diluted before and might again if sales don’t scale fast enough. But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don’t buy this thinking it’s a safe biotech. You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks. And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy, real revenue, growing adoption, a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers, and a valuation priced like it’s dead. I’m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science, the market, and the timing actually line up. If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts, this has legitimate multi-bagger potential. Q4 will be turning point. Get in before the stock rips. It will create generational wealth. If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn’t complete vapor, this is one of the few worth watching.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am writing this on my phone . So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes . What IOVA does Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors . Roughly over 90 % remaining 10 % being Blood Their product Amtagvi lifileucel is a onetime TIL therapy tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes . Doctors take T cells from the tumor Iovance expands them into billions and those cells get infused back into the patient . Very intuitive essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer . Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real durable responses . This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers . Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works . I hold 30000 shares . 2 Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths . You may have heard of CART but that doesn ’ t work on them . They only work for blood cancer which is only 10 % of TAM rest being Soldin tumor cancer . Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment and 2L severely lacking treatment . If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers the market is massive . Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD . Add cervical NSCLC head and neck ovarian the upside gets wide quickly . In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications with several already in late stage phase 3 . The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat . And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area . With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment . NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space . No_other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is . They have their own manufacturing facilities that ’ s worth 1 billion USD itself . 3 Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid2024 . Early numbers • Q2 around $ 31M • Q3 around $ 62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter . 70 treatment centers active or onboarding . Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250300M range . And management has reiterated their range for EOY . For a $ 1B market cap company that ’ s extremely low valuation . 3 Bear Case arguments that don ’ t hold water Execution With IOVA bears and shorts never_questioned the science but about the execution . I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible . However they bought in a new CFO Corleen Roche in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40 % in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption This was another pain point during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA . Since it is a Novel treatment . Patient referrals by Doctors was slow and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process . In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies . The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff . Q4 will be explosive . Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write 1 . Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast . If they keep beating the market rerates this quickly . Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target . Q4 will be huge for this stock 2 . New indications Cervical cancer filing potential . NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval Firstline melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3 . 3 . Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway . UK is already approved but not_announced Canada already approved . 4 . Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time more patients more revenue . 5 . Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable any major pharma would want this platform . 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy LongTerm Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers . The total addressable market becomes enormous . At least $ 30B and at current share prices that ’ s $ 75 per share . Even if you are super bear about this stock at $ 10 minimum is already better than its current price . Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock . Firstinclass advantage strong early sales a huge melanoma market and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers . If they execute this isn ’ t a 5 percent upside story . It ’ s potentially several multiples . This is why I ’ m long 30K shares . Risks Not_sugarcoated • Manufacturing is complex . • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong . Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail . But highly unlikely given its recent data release . It ’ s incredible • Volatility is brutal . Shorts have been at this stock with about 35 % shorted . However about 8090 % is owned by Institutions . Big names like Blackrock GS etc .. • They ’ ve diluted before and might again if sales don ’ t scale fast enough . But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don ’ t buy this thinking it ’ s a safe biotech . You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks . And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy real revenue growing adoption a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers and a valuation priced like it ’ s dead . I ’ m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science the market and the timing actually line up . If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts this has legitimate multibagger potential . Q4 will be turning point . Get in before the stock rips . It will create generational wealth . If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn ’ t complete vapor this is one of the few worth watching ."

      "selftext": "I wanted to share some things going on in Applovin from a personal experience as a mobile developer with 10 years experience in the market that investors here might find relevant. Some indie developers (we) have been affected by Applovin account suspensions in the last month. These are meddium-size accounts (far from large publishers but definitely not small accounts) which were created years ago and have proven record of not engage in malpractice, in good standing and keeping within ToS. Funds ranging from 7000$ to 10.000$ have been witheld from us without explanation or response to any contact attempts. The following is my post: [ Independent from that, what appears to be system wide payments delay (potentially future payment freezes) have also been reported this month. [ Some developers have reported considering legal action which would be added to the SEC ( and State AG ( investigations already in progress due to its data practices and ad quality. Generally developers prefer not to speak out about these bans but, even if not publicly spoken, it is a widespread opinion in the mobile dev community that Applovin engages in all kinds of \"shady\" practices. Reason we keep working with them is they are close to a monopolistic position (alongise Google AdMob) with their platform, high eCPM and and market share. **Disclaimer: I have no capacity whatsover to do stock analisys or valuations and this kind of news might not be relevant to investors in this subreddit, I apologize to mods in advance if that's the case.**",

      "selftext_processed": "I wanted to share some things going on in Applovin from a personal experience as a mobile developer with 10 years experience in the market that investors here might find relevant . Some indie developers we have been affected by Applovin account suspensions in the last month . These are meddiumsize accounts far from large publishers but definitely not_small accounts which were created years ago and have proven record of not_engage in malpractice in good standing and keeping within ToS . Funds ranging from 7000 $ to 10.000 $ have been witheld from us without explanation or response to any contact attempts . The following is my post Independent from that what appears to be system wide payments delay potentially future payment freezes have also been reported this month . Some developers have reported considering legal action which would be added to the SEC and State AG investigations already in progress due to its data practices and ad quality . Generally developers prefer not_to speak out about these bans but even if not_publicly spoken it is a widespread opinion in the mobile dev community that Applovin engages in all kinds of shady practices . Reason we keep working with them is they are close to a monopolistic position alongise Google AdMob with their platform high eCPM and and market share . Disclaimer I have no_capacity whatsover to do stock analisys or valuations and this kind of news might not_be relevant to investors in this subreddit I apologize to mods in advance if thats the case ."

      "title": "Why Some Commercial Biotech Companies Get Valued on Trailing Revenue Instead of Forward Expectations",
      "selftext": "Over the past year I’ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercial-stage biotech companies. Unlike most sectors, which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue, early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter. This creates situations where companies with FDA approval, real product sales, and multi-year cash runways still get priced as if nothing meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two. One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer’s drug called Zunveyl into long-term care earlier this year. They reported a little over $2.6 million in product revenue last quarter, and early adoption from facilities has been steady, but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering, solid QoQ growth. It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech. Is this caution justified, or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase? [](",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past year I ’ ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercialstage biotech companies . Unlike most sectors which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter . This creates situations where companies with FDA approval real product sales and multiyear cash runways still get priced as if nothing_meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two . One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer ’ s drug called Zunveyl into longterm care earlier this year . They reported a little over $ 2.6 million in product revenue last quarter and early adoption from facilities has been steady but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering solid QoQ growth . It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech where the shift from a “ pipeline story ” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quartertoquarter noise . In most other industries companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter so I ’ m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech . Is this caution justified or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase"

I ’ ve been experimenting with small scripts to track price movements filter stocksforex pairs and backtest simple ideas and honestly it ’ s opened a whole new way of looking at data . Instead of guessing I ’ m making decisions backed by actual numbers . If anyone else has used coding to improve their trading or investing I ’ d love to hear your experiences .

      "selftext": "Hey Everyone, I am rebuilding my investment portfolio after taking a big hit during the 2021-2022 crash(almost lost 200k). Back then I was very new to the stocks and not enough knowledge, was listening way too much to WSB I guess. I have had financials difficulties and had to file a consumer proposal. Lost mu business and house that I could not close in 2023. So last few years have been really tough, now I have restarted a new business and everything seems to be going okay so far. My business is doing okay at the moment, and I can comfortably invest around $10K per month. I’ve set up recurring weekly buys in Wealthsimple (since that’s my main platform). I’m mostly focusing on Canadian-listed ETFs to avoid the forex fees that come with buying/selling U.S. ETFs. Here is the list of my current holdings: |Category|Holdings Included|Current Value|2× Value (After +100%)|% of Portfolio| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |🇨🇦 **Canadian Equity**|XIC (TFSA + Non-Reg)|$6,717.35|**$13,434.70**|**18.5 %**| |🇺🇸 **U.S. Equity**|VFV + TSLA + SOFI|$10,314.18|**$20,628.36**|**28.3 %**| |🌍 **International Equity**|XEF|$8,257.78|**$16,515.56**|**22.6 %**| |🌐 **Global / Mixed Equity**|VEQT|$7,543.03|**$15,086.06**|**20.7 %**| |₿ **Crypto Assets**|BTC + ETH + SOL|$2,146.80|**$4,293.60**|**5.9 %**| |💵 **Total Portfolio Value**||**$36,980**|**≈ $73,960 CAD**|**100 %**| I do weekly auto buys: \\- VFV (S&P 500 exposure) \\- VEQT (Golbal equity) \\- XIC (Canadian market) \\- XEF (Global market) \\- A few individual positions : NVDA, TSLA, SOFI \\- Crypto: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP (Small portion) Total: about $3,400/week (\\~$14K/month) split between TFSA, non-registered, and crypto. I would like advice on: \\- Am I diversifying correctly, are there better options? \\- Is my allocation too equity-heavy? \\- Any suggestions on dividend stocks? \\- Should I do one or two ETFs only instead of these many? I am just rebuilding my life and want to be careful, while making a good amount of investment towards our family's future. I don't want to do real-estate at all, not in next few years at least. Just want to start investing as much I can. Any advice/critisim is welcomes. Please give your thought. Thank you!",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I, 20M, invest 2,500 dollars a month. I do an on/off split where one month I do the full 2,500 into my stocks/ETfs, and the next month I’ll do 2,100 into stocks/ETFs, but 400 into crypto (only BTC and ETH, 200 dollars each) As we’ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately (BTC is well below 90k at the moment) and it leads me questioning, should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do? Or just put my money straight into my stocks/ETS, and don’t do crypto? I mainly see crypto as a gamble. Not as an investment, I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype, I’m not really sure what my money is even going into. Any, and all advice is welcome! I plan to be in the market for a very very long time. Thank you for taking time to read this and reply :)",

I do an onoff split where one month I do the full 2500 into my stocksETfs and the next month I ’ ll do 2100 into stocksETFs but 400 into crypto only BTC and ETH 200 dollars each As we ’ ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately BTC is well below 90k at the moment and it leads me questioning should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do Or just put my money straight into my stocksETS and don ’ t do crypto I mainly see crypto as a gamble . Not_as an investment I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype I ’ m not_really sure what my money is even going into . Any and all advice is welcome I plan to be in the market for a very very long time . Thank you for taking time to read this and reply"

      "selftext": "Some of the best ideas I've gotten to invest in stocks over the last 20 years have come from the pages of Barron's Magazine, so I'm going to start trying to summarize some of the stock picks made by Barron's in the current week's magazine. Barron's is released on Fridays after the market closes, so Monday is the first day to trade on their picks, and historically a Barron's recommendation can have a market moving effect because their influence on Wall Street is so strong. But do your own research and due diligence. From the December 1 Magazine: RBLX. Barron's thinks Roblox can move up 50% over the next 12 months, given its growing influence among children and young gamers, its low cost tools for designing new games and viral method of distribution. Article quotes an analyst who calls Roblox the Youtube of the online gaming industry. Stock is 30% off its highs given concerns about safety and content moderation regulation, but for the adventurous investor this might present a buying opportunity. D. Dominion Energy has been on the rise YTD but is only reaching a stock price that it reached back in 2023. Dominion has a reasonable P/E of 17 and a dividend yield of 4.3%. The catalyst: D is favorably resolving a regulatory issue over a big wind project under development which has depressed its stock price for 2 years. It is now is poised to benefit from the rise in data center energy needs that other electric utility stocks already have. SHOP. A Barron's article about AI enabling the retail industry, Barron's highlights Shopify as one of the early winners. Shopify's most recent earnings report showed early signs that AI is helping SHOP help their customer's online operation to increase revenues. GOOGL. Google was a big pick by Barron's six months ago to \"play catch-up\" with the rest of the MAG7 stocks as it was by far the most undervalued.

      "selftext_processed": "Some of the best ideas Ive gotten to invest in stocks over the last 20 years have come from the pages of Barrons Magazine so Im going to start trying to summarize some of the stock picks made by Barrons in the current weeks magazine . Barrons is released on Fridays after the market closes so Monday is the first day to trade on their picks and historically a Barrons recommendation can have a market moving effect because their influence on Wall Street is so strong . But do your own research and due diligence . From the December 1 Magazine RBLX . Barrons thinks Roblox can move up 50 % over the next 12 months given its growing influence among children and young gamers its low cost tools for designing new games and viral method of distribution . Article quotes an analyst who calls Roblox the Youtube of the online gaming industry . Stock is 30 % off its highs given concerns about safety and content moderation regulation but for the adventurous investor this might present a buying opportunity . D. Dominion Energy has been on the rise YTD but is only reaching a stock price that it reached back in 2023 . Dominion has a reasonable PE of 17 and a dividend yield of 4.3 % . The catalyst D is favorably resolving a regulatory issue over a big wind project under development which has depressed its stock price for 2 years . It is now is poised to benefit from the rise in data center energy needs that other electric utility stocks already have . SHOP . A Barrons article about AI enabling the retail industry Barrons highlights Shopify as one of the early winners . Shopifys most recent earnings report showed early signs that AI is helping SHOP help their customers online operation to increase revenues . GOOGL . Google was a big pick by Barrons six months ago to play catchup with the rest of the MAG7 stocks as it was by far the most undervalued . Barrons call was very timely and lucrative and two items in this weeks Barrons reiterate the recommendation one highlighting the breakout of Google Gemini 3 as the leading AI LLM and the second article citing the emergence of Googles TPU chips as a competitive threat to Nvidia GPUs as evidenced by Metas rumored deal to use Google Cloud and TPUs to power its AI ."

      "selftext": "I have spent past couple years researching what causes new investors and traders to consistently lose money… patterns that are rarely discussed in traditional finance books. While writing a book on the subject, I noticed some surprising trends. Three common traps every trader falls into: 1. Chasing hype: buying stock because “it feels right” or everyone is talking about it. 2. Ignoring red flags: small warnings signs in chart or social sentiment are overlooked. 3. Emotional overthinking: overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades. I’m genuinely curious, which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friends/family fall for? Have you ever read a finance book that actually warned you about these mistakes or do most books just gloss over emotional side of trading?",

While writing a book on the subject I noticed some surprising trends . Three common traps every trader falls into 1 . Chasing hype buying stock because “ it feels right ” or everyone is talking about it . 2 . Ignoring red flags small warnings signs in chart or social sentiment are overlooked . 3 . Emotional overthinking overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades . I ’ m genuinely curious which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friendsfamily fall for Have you ever read a finance book that actually warned you about these mistakes or do most books just gloss over emotional side of trading"

      "selftext": "So Trump randomly talking about shutting down airspace around Venezuela got me thinking about what actually happens to the markets if the US really goes after them again. I’m not making predictions or anything, just trying to understand the market side of it. Venezuela doesn’t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil, so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys. Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit, so if Trump goes full “we’re doing something big” again, that probably means oil jumps, energy stocks breathe for a bit, and airlines get punched in the face like usual. I’m wondering more about the broader market though. If it’s just a one-off strike, markets probably dip early then go back to normal (like they always do). But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess, then I can see VIX spiking, EM getting slapped, gold doing its “I’m useful again” thing, and everyone pretending they predicted it. Trump also flip-flops so much that it’s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves, but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn’t just fade in a day? Not looking for political takes, just the market angle.",

I ’ m not_making predictions or anything just trying to understand the market side of it . Venezuela doesn ’ t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys . Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit so if Trump goes full “ we ’ re doing something big ” again that probably means oil jumps energy stocks breathe for a bit and airlines get punched in the face like usual . I ’ m wondering more about the broader market though . If it ’ s just a oneoff strike markets probably dip early then go back to normal like they always do . But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess then I can see VIX spiking EM getting slapped gold doing its “ I ’ m useful again ” thing and everyone pretending they predicted it . Trump also flipflops so much that it ’ s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn ’ t just fade in a day Not_looking for political takes just the market angle ."

In probably around 10 years vr tech could be advanced enough to make it the best way to view content and if you pair it with ai realtime generated worlds then you can basically have a way to give customers an infinite amount of content with the vast ip universes that Disney owns. The highest quality real time ai world generation will cost money on servers to generate in real time so youtubers won’t be able to afford it. This could give big companies a leg up on your normal day content creators who can’t afford the server costs to produce highest quality ai generated content and they won’t have any of the vast universes Disney can use. medium risk expects the following.. \\-in 10 years ai will get good enough that people will want to interact with realtime ai generated worlds. \\-management to incorporate ai successfully",

Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza. >As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade. >Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012. >The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024. >Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. >Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.) >“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.” >Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said. >The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior. >Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year. >A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.” >Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found. >Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide? >The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending. >Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring. >“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Weak consumer spending refers to store expectations before the season started . Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No_paywall Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season . Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza . As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade . Challenger Gray Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012 . The National Retail Federation a trade group also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season plans to bring on extra staff could be at “ the lowest level in more than 15 years. ” Retailers were expected to bring on 265000 to 365000 seasonal workers compared to 442000 in 2024 . Interest in seasonal work though remains plenty high — up 27 % at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board according to Cory Stahle a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab . Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7 % from a year ago and still below prepandemic levels . Indeed ’ s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall such as in accounting and ski resorts rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail Stahle said . “ I think it ’ s very telling that we ’ re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago ” Stahle said . “ There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall. ” Retail especially has “ just really pulled back ” he said . The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119000 positions that month though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts . The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare food services and drinking places and social assistance and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior . Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans . Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year . A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach saying “ For the past few years we ’ ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates . It ’ s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive. ” Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a Kshaped economy . A recent survey of 1048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America ’ s Future found that 68 % of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year while 59 % anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year . Just 5 % of respondents were actively hiring or expanding while 16 % were scaling back the survey found . Read more What is a Kshaped economy and whats causing the divide The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending . Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring . “ Employers aren ’ t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through or to the degree in which people are going to spend and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing ” Stahle said ."

I’ve run several iterations over the past few weeks and I think this version is close to finalized. The goal is to capture long term upside from large cap AI leaders while balancing that exposure with broad market, growth, and large-cap ETFs. Essentially: high conviction + diversified stability. I’m open to suggestions. Current Allocation Proposal: 25% FSKAX – Total U.S. market exposure (small/mid caps, defensives, full sector diversification) 15% FSPGX – Large cap growth tilt without overly concentrating the portfolio 10% VUG – Additional high growth exposure with a low cost mega-cap focus 15% MSFT – Core AI & cloud leader 12% GOOG – Strong AI, ads, and cloud positioning; still attractively valued 12% META – Massive FCF with accelerating AI and social monetization 8% NVDA – AI infrastructure leader (kept at a disciplined weight for volatility control) 3% CRWD – cybersecurity growth kicker The intention is to build something that behaves like a high-yield savings engine over 5–10 years strong compounding, manageable volatility, and diversified enough to preserve capital for future opportunities (real estate, business acquisition, etc.).

After losing some money by following trends and not knowing what i was doing, i was financially down a bit with some of my first investments as a person now in my 20s. But the past 2 weeks Ive been greening just about everyday. I know how to time when i stock shoots up, i know when to sell now. I know what to look for. I just really need payoff. I'm tired of seeing other people get their payday. I want to know my intuition will turn into something. I want this week to be one i remember. I know it’s about balance and not letting my emotions get in the way. Edit: Do not harass me and insult me for my posts about investing. It is my interest and it’s a public forum. If I am on topic there is no reason for these targets on my character. I have done nothing wrong but post about overcoming my losses with solid profit and trusting my own abilities.",

      "selftext": "Edit: What I mean to say is that I cost myself 10 years of work by following his advice - my fault - obviously he did not hold a gun to my head. Back then he was not a clown with a show... he was a fund manager just like the fund managers you see as guests on shows today (there was less internet and info back in 2000). Many of his strategies crashed too fast to get out in one piece and he was still recommending to buy more when they started to fall. Since then I have earned more money and invested in ETFs slowly working my way to retired. My goal is to let younger folks chasing 10x at high CAPE know that the individual recommendations did poorly when the bubble burst but the ETFs slowly and steady got to retirement goal. \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2000 Jim Cramer went viral with his 'only 10 stocks to buy/own for the future'. He said he was buying them every day, especially if they went down, valuations were old fashioned... they were guaranteed 10-20x. # Jim Cramer's 'only 10 stocks to own for the future' 1. **724 Solutions** 2. **Ariba** 3. **Digital Island** 4. **Exodus Communications** 5. **InfoSpace** 6. **Inktomi** 7. **Mercury Interactive** 8. **Sonera** 9. **VeriSign** 10. **Veritas Software** Cramer's choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole. By contrast, the same initial $100,000 in a passive S&P 500 index investment would be worth **\\~$712,600** today. This is how taking Jim Cramer's recommendations made me work 10 extra years before I could retire (not hypothetical... true story). I'm just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for 'guaranteed 10x' and I still see Cramer fanboys... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up... the true challenge is who can predict success over time. Someone will say 'VeriSign' is/was great... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90% bad choices and resulted in a 50% loss over 25 years vs 700% gain if you ignored him and listened to Boggle. Young people may not think this is a big deal... but trust me... when you are old... having to work 10 more years is painful.",

      "selftext_processed": "Edit What I mean to say is that I cost myself 10 years of work by following his advice my fault obviously he did not_hold a gun to my head . Back then he was not_a clown with a show ... he was a fund manager just like the fund managers you see as guests on shows today there was less internet and info back in 2000 . Many of his strategies crashed too fast to get out in one piece and he was still recommending to buy more when they started to fall . Since then I have earned more money and invested in ETFs slowly working my way to retired . My goal is to let younger folks chasing 10x at high CAPE know that the individual recommendations did poorly when the bubble burst but the ETFs slowly and steady got to retirement goal . In 2000 Jim Cramer went viral with his only 10 stocks to buyown for the future . He said he was buying them every day especially if they went down valuations were old fashioned ... they were guaranteed 1020x . Jim Cramers only 10 stocks to own for the future 1 . 724 Solutions 2 . Ariba 3 . Digital Island 4 . Exodus Communications 5 . InfoSpace 6 . Inktomi 7 . Mercury Interactive 8 . Sonera 9 . VeriSign 10 . Veritas Software Cramers choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole . By contrast the same initial $ 100000 in a passive SP 500 index investment would be worth $ 712600 today . This is how taking Jim Cramers recommendations made me work 10 extra years before I could retire not hypothetical ... true story . Im just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for guaranteed 10x and I still see Cramer fanboys ... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up ... the true challenge is who can predict success over time . Someone will say VeriSign iswas great ... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90 % bad choices and resulted in a 50 % loss over 25 years vs 700 % gain if you ignored him and listened to Boggle . Young people may not_think this is a big deal ... but trust me ... when you are old ... having to work 10 more years is painful ."

Could there soon be a partnership between announced between QCOM and an AI lab, even OpenAI? I feel like it is one of the few big semi firms that are left. Are you bullish?",

      "selftext": "Hey folks, Relatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \\~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \\~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. Profile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\\~30k) looks something like this: ETFs: \\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN) \\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6) \\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) Stocks: \\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML \\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech & Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays. \\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close. Before you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. Eventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. Can you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives? I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons. Lastly, I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO, QQQ and others. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey folks Relatively new investor here just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security . I have a pretty high risk tolerance for 50 % of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and 50 % in long term 20 year ETFs as retirement fund . Profile 33M single no_kids western Europe low mortgage low expenses have a 3 month safety net monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 500 per month with the following portfolio goal note my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs . My current portfolio 30k looks something like this ETFs 30 % Amundi Prime AllWorld WEBN 10 % Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc LYP6 5 % WisdomTree Europe Defence EUDF Stocks 30 % across 10 medium term high conviction TechAI GOOGL MSFT NVDA META AMD AVGO NBIS SOFI ASML 20 % across 20 or so shortmedium term low conviction Tech Other stocks I won´t list them but everything from AMZ VRT IREN TSMC MU BABA RKLB ASTS and some utilities raw materials etc generally speculative plays . 5 % I consider noise learning experiences minor investments of 5 50 eur which I´ll gradually close . Before you all jump down my throat I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated . Given my risk profile I am happy to keep 30 40 % of portfolio within the growthtech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble . I am also happy to keep 10 % in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so . For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments . Eventually as I get older and want more security I will aim for 6070 % ETFs maybe some other assets like goldreal estatebonds etc so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant . I´m considering adding something like FTSE AllWorld High Dividend Yield Acc VHYG or an Emerging MarketsexUS fund . I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns sector rotations crashes . I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable defensive consumerutility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions . I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s hightech or highUS given the above allocation . Can you give me your thoughts on this Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more Should I stick to WEBN LYP6 or any better alternatives I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies and want to allocate accordingly e.g . I do not_want to invest in PLTR APPL TSLA for reasons . Lastly I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO QQQ and others . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Intel shares jumped as much as 10% on Friday, marking the stock's fifth consecutive session of gains, after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is on track to have Intel manufacture its lowest-end M-series chips using the 18A process as early as mid-2027. The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly. Intel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.",

      "selftext": "I always read tha WLI is a terrible investment, maybe it is for most people, but I'm wondering if it really is for those with high income and a decent amount of money invested already. Assume you make enough money to max out your 401k, HSA, and already have large amounts in stocks, real estate, and other alternative asset classes like crypto or gold. EDIT: you are not comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already. With an IRR of 3.5% over 30 years that you can access through tax-free loans (loan interest is covered by cash value interests), wouldn't WLI yield decent returns for retirement? Consider that at a tax rate of 40%, a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8% in IRR for the same after-tax money. EDIT: HYSA's yield about 3.5% pre-tax. EDIT: please don't simply reply \"yes\" or \"no\" without justification, this thread is not meant to be a vote FINAL EDIT & CONCLUSION: From y'all's comments, my take-away is that a WLI is complex and requires to sustain a high income/savings over 10+ years to start to see the advantages. As far as I'm concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bonds-like return-risk profile. In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its tax-deferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value. It also gives optionality for estate planning. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have a solid, sustainable cash flow already (for instance already maxing out all tax-advantaged accounts). Thanks all !",

      "selftext_processed": "I always read tha WLI is a terrible investment maybe it is for most people but Im wondering if it really is for those with high income and a decent amount of money invested already . Assume you make enough money to max out your 401k HSA and already have large amounts in stocks real estate and other alternative asset classes like crypto or gold . EDIT you are not_comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already . With an IRR of 3.5 % over 30 years that you can access through taxfree loans loan interest is covered by cash value interests wouldnt WLI yield decent returns for retirement Consider that at a tax rate of 40 % a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8 % in IRR for the same aftertax money . EDIT HYSAs yield about 3.5 % pretax . EDIT please dont simply reply yes or no without justification this thread is not_meant to be a vote FINAL EDIT CONCLUSION From yalls comments my takeaway is that a WLI is complex and requires to sustain a high incomesavings over 10 years to start to see the advantages . As far as Im concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bondslike returnrisk profile . In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its taxdeferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value . It also gives optionality for estate planning . I wouldnt recommend it to someone who doesnt have a solid sustainable cash flow already for instance already maxing out all taxadvantaged accounts . Thanks all"

      "selftext": "Hey folks- happy Thanksgiving! Semi-analysis ( leading research lab in semiconductors and Ai) have just published a report on the hot topic. $GOOGL TpU vs $Nvida GpU. They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it! - Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips. - This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no longer the only monopoly for Ai chips. - Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap! At the 9k standard rack size, Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu. - what does this mean for GPU users? Google tpu will crush with margins. They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable. - nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60% in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market. - OpenAi is in huge trouble. They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU. But the price difference means they will see bad/negative margins for a while. Almost 1/2 trillion in losses for the next 5 years. Compute is expensive & seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU. - NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting. Initial trials to see how market response is. Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $GOOGL is $META & Xai. Both who are huge nvida customers! This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this. I am in a pair trade with long $GOOGL shares + $AVGO calls and short on $NVDA/$AMD. It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models, Google cloud ☁️ dominance over Aws/AZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida. Firing in on all fronts.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey folks happy Thanksgiving Semianalysis leading research lab in semiconductors and Ai have just published a report on the hot topic . $ GOOGL TpU vs $ Nvida GpU . They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips . This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no_longer the only monopoly for Ai chips . Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap At the 9k standard rack size Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu . what does this mean for GPU users Google tpu will crush with margins . They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable . nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60 % in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market . OpenAi is in huge trouble . They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU . But the price difference means they will see badnegative margins for a while . Almost 12 trillion in losses for the next 5 years . Compute is expensive seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU . NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting . Initial trials to see how market response is . Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $ GOOGL is $ META Xai . Both who are huge nvida customers This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this . I am in a pair trade with long $ GOOGL shares $ AVGO calls and short on $ NVDA $ AMD . It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models Google cloud ☁️ dominance over AwsAZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida . Firing in on all fronts ."

      "selftext": "The foundation of the global financial system, Japan, is beginning to shift. For more than three decades, global asset prices including US Treasuries, technology stocks, and real estate have quietly depended on Japan’s ultra-low interest rate policy. This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade, where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higher-yielding global assets. The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades. In November 2025, that logic began to collapse. Yields on long-term Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades, with 20-year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40-year bonds nearing 3.7 percent. This is not a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression. The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability. As Japanese yields rise, funding costs climb worldwide, currency volatility spreads, and the unwinding of long-standing carry trades begins. Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in, tightening liquidity across global markets. The implications extend far beyond Japan. The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries, which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system. A stronger yen can pressure the dollar, forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets. What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system. Crypto markets, being the most liquidity-sensitive segment of global finance, are already showing signs of strain. As liquidity dries up, volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous. Traders are forced to adjust strategies, often moving from high-risk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans. In many ways, crypto acts as a real-time indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift. As global liquidity tightens, crypto’s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible. On one hand, its price action mirrors broader risk-off cycles as capital flees leverage. On the other, decentralized markets continue to function around the clock, offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress. Stablecoin redemptions, exchange outflows, and on-chain volume spikes serve as real-time indicators of changing sentiment. Meanwhile, traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility, shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions. In this new environment, the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not just as speculation but as infrastructure, a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance. But this environment also exposes another weakness, the fragility of market infrastructure. During periods of sharp volatility, execution delays, failed orders, and platform outages become common. In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often, reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment. Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed, security, and verifiable reserves, building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not. The world long assumed Japan would stay still. But now it is moving, and the ripple effect has only just begun. edit: Really appreciate all the insights in the comments, especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground. I didn’t expect this topic to spark so much discussion, but it’s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes. After reading through everyone’s replies, I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week’s swings. Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded. Out of curiosity, I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here, and to my surprise, execution was much smoother. Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves. It might not be the biggest name, but when markets go crazy, that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "The foundation of the global financial system Japan is beginning to shift . For more than three decades global asset prices including US Treasuries technology stocks and real estate have quietly depended on Japan ’ s ultralow interest rate policy . This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higheryielding global assets . The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades . In November 2025 that logic began to collapse . Yields on longterm Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades with 20year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40year bonds nearing 3.7 percent . This is not_a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression . The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability . As Japanese yields rise funding costs climb worldwide currency volatility spreads and the unwinding of longstanding carry trades begins . Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in tightening liquidity across global markets . The implications extend far beyond Japan . The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system . A stronger yen can pressure the dollar forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets . What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system . Crypto markets being the most liquiditysensitive segment of global finance are already showing signs of strain . As liquidity dries up volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous . Traders are forced to adjust strategies often moving from highrisk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans . In many ways crypto acts as a realtime indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift . As global liquidity tightens crypto ’ s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible . On one hand its price action mirrors broader riskoff cycles as capital flees leverage . On the other decentralized markets continue to function around the clock offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress . Stablecoin redemptions exchange outflows and onchain volume spikes serve as realtime indicators of changing sentiment . Meanwhile traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions . In this new environment the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not_just as speculation but as infrastructure a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance . But this environment also exposes another weakness the fragility of market infrastructure . During periods of sharp volatility execution delays failed orders and platform outages become common . In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment . Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed security and verifiable reserves building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not_The world long assumed Japan would stay still . But now it is moving and the ripple effect has only just begun . edit Really appreciate all the insights in the comments especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground . I didn ’ t expect this topic to spark so much discussion but it ’ s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes . After reading through everyone ’ s replies I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week ’ s swings . Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded . Out of curiosity I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here and to my surprise execution was much smoother . Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves . It might not_be the biggest name but when markets go crazy that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else ."

These companies are borrowing massive amounts from banks like JPMorgan to build data centers, while taking on none of the actual risk.

      "selftext": "I'm exploring ways to diversify my investment portfolio and preserve capital.A close friend, who has extensive connections in gemstone mining and processing, suggested I look into investment-grade colored gemstones. He claims that high-quality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity. He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source. The entry point seems accessible, starting from a couple thousand dollars, but to acquire something truly noteworthy, the investment would likely be in the range of $50,000 to $200,000. Has anyone had experience with this asset class? What are your thoughts on its potential and risks? Also, if you're knowledgeable, could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market?",

He claims that highquality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity . He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source . The entry point seems accessible starting from a couple thousand dollars but to acquire something truly noteworthy the investment would likely be in the range of $ 50000 to $ 200000 . Has anyone had experience with this asset class What are your thoughts on its potential and risks Also if youre knowledgeable could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market"

The five platforms I’m currently considering are: • **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** • **DEGIRO** • **flatex** • **Trading212** • **GBE Brokers** I’m mainly a buy-and-hold investor. My priorities are: **1. Access to a wide range of ETFs / stocks** I want to make sure I can invest in: • major European-domiciled ETFs • US-listed ETFs (with W-8BEN) • individual stocks globally (EU, US, maybe Asia) If you use any of these platforms, how broad is their ETF/stock selection? **2. Cost efficiency** I care about: • commission fees • FX conversion fees • custody fees • any hidden/inactivity fees • spreads Which of these platforms ends up being *actually* the cheapest for long-term ETF investing? **3. Trustworthiness & security** Any red flags or concerns with any of these five? **4. Account currency & multi-currency support** My situation is: • I’m originally from the EU (so EUR is my “home currency”) • I currently earn income in **USD** • and also in **Thai Baht (THB)** So a broker that supports **multi-currency accounts** or **low FX costs** would be ideal, but not sure if that is possible. Right now my two main currencies are USD and THB. If you use any of these platforms with multiple currencies, how does it work in practice? **5. Overall experience** • UI / mobile app • deposit/withdrawal ease • customer support • reliability **TL;DR** If you had to choose one broker - mainly for building a long-term ETF + stock portfolio, and you could pick from Trading212, IBKR, DEGIRO, flatex, or GBE Brokers, **which one would you pick and why?** Thanks in advance for any insights!",

The five platforms I ’ m currently considering are • Interactive Brokers IBKR • DEGIRO • flatex • Trading212 • GBE Brokers I ’ m mainly a buyandhold investor . My priorities are 1 . Access to a wide range of ETFs stocks I want to make sure I can invest in • major Europeandomiciled ETFs • USlisted ETFs with W8BEN • individual stocks globally EU US maybe Asia If you use any of these platforms how broad is their ETFstock selection 2 . Cost efficiency I care about • commission fees • FX conversion fees • custody fees • any hiddeninactivity fees • spreads Which of these platforms ends up being actually the cheapest for longterm ETF investing 3 . Trustworthiness security Any red flags or concerns with any of these five 4 . Account currency multicurrency support My situation is • I ’ m originally from the EU so EUR is my “ home currency ” • I currently earn income in USD • and also in Thai Baht THB So a broker that supports multicurrency accounts or low FX costs would be ideal but not_sure if that is possible . Right now my two main currencies are USD and THB . If you use any of these platforms with multiple currencies how does it work in practice 5 . Overall experience • UI mobile app • depositwithdrawal ease • customer support • reliability TLDR If you had to choose one broker mainly for building a longterm ETF stock portfolio and you could pick from Trading212 IBKR DEGIRO flatex or GBE Brokers which one would you pick and why Thanks in advance for any insights"

      "selftext": "If you want long-term consistency in Forex, resilience matters more than finding the “perfect setup.” Here are a few practical tips that actually help: **1. Don’t depend on one strategy.** Markets change. Have at least a trend setup and a range setup so you’re not stuck when conditions shift. **2. Keep position sizing small.** Risk 0.5%–1% per trade. Most accounts blow up because of sizing, not bad entries. **3. Backtest but trust real results more.** Run your tests → forward-test → then trade small until you have 30–50 real trades that confirm your edge. **4. Make your rules simple and mechanical.** Clear entries, exits, stop-loss, and “no trade” conditions. Emotional trading kills consistency. **5. Accept losing streaks.** Even good systems have 5–7 losses in a row. Resilience is sticking to the plan anyway. **6. Review weekly, not every trade.** You learn more from patterns, not individual outcomes.",

      "selftext": "Probably going to get ridiculed with this one, but here it goes... My wife and I have had a financial advisor for the past 3 years. She has given us some good advice and been helpful, considering we knew absolutely nothing about investing when we started our account with her. She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money, but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETF's that \"her team\" has chosen based on our risk assessment. I periodically receive buy & sell orders, which is nice to see that the account *is* in-fact being actively managed to a degree, but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the S&P 500, so they're really not beating the market. We pay her 1% of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an \"advisors fee\" and currently have roughly $450k in the account. When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole, but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by - CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started. I recently (fairly bluntly) asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1% advisors fee we pay if they're not beating the market. She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was \"the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds, retirement goals, tax deference strategies, etc.\". Okay, all makes sense and is respected, but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my son's 529 and she told me \"we don't do that\". What she meant was they don't have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity, and therefore couldn't make their 1% on it. That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives, fees, etc. But I ended up having to do all the research myself, which I realized wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would have been. Still though, would have been nice if the $4,500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself... I'm starting to feel - especially from reading others' sentiments on this subreddit - that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected, and/or for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves - i.e. have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25% and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear. My wife and I are both very young and, barring nothing unexpected, should not need this money for quite a long time. As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not touch it for another 25+ years. Over that much time, that 1% fee we're paying adds up to a good chunk of money, esp. when factoring in compounding interest. I'm not trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible, esp. if there is good reason to be paying it. But it's certainly not nothing, and I wouldn't mind it if I felt like we were actually *getting* something for paying it. Is this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1% back into our pocket and just do something like VT & chill? Or do I just stay the course, let her and her team continue \"managing\" everything, and when if/when we need the help I have someone readily available to me?",

      "selftext_processed": "Probably going to get ridiculed with this one but here it goes ... My wife and I have had a financial advisor for the past 3 years . She has given us some good advice and been helpful considering we knew absolutely nothing_about investing when we started our account with her . She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETFs that her team has chosen based on our risk assessment . I periodically receive buy sell orders which is nice to see that the account is infact being actively managed to a degree but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the SP 500 so theyre really not_beating the market . We pay her 1 % of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an advisors fee and currently have roughly $ 450k in the account . When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started . I recently fairly bluntly asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1 % advisors fee we pay if theyre not_beating the market . She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds retirement goals tax deference strategies etc .. Okay all makes sense and is respected but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my sons 529 and she told me we dont do that . What she meant was they dont have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity and therefore couldnt make their 1 % on it . That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives fees etc . But I ended up having to do all the research myself which I realized wasnt nearly as scary as I thought it would have been . Still though would have been nice if the $ 4500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself ... Im starting to feel especially from reading others sentiments on this subreddit that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected andor for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves i.e . have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25 % and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear . My wife and I are both very young and barring nothing_unexpected should not_need this money for quite a long time . As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not_touch it for another 25 years . Over that much time that 1 % fee were paying adds up to a good chunk of money esp . when factoring in compounding interest . Im not_trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible esp . if there is good reason to be paying it . But its certainly not_nothing and I wouldnt mind it if I felt like we were actually getting something for paying it . Is this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1 % back into our pocket and just do something like VT chill Or do I just stay the course let her and her team continue managing everything and when ifwhen we need the help I have someone readily available to me"

      "selftext": "I currently have a youth brokerage account on Fidelity, and I have about 56% of my money invested in FXAIX (the S&P 500 fund of Fidelity). I’m unsure what I should do with the rest of it, the other 44%. I don’t have a job (am underage), so I am not getting the same tax benefits someone with a Roth IRA would get. That is fine - once I get a job / am older, I will transfer the money from FXAIX into a Roth IRA. I don’t know how or where I should invest at my age... I think I want to save what I have right now primarily for retirement instead of for a house or other large payment, since I know time in the market is the most important aspect of investing. Should I increase the % of my balance in FXAIX, since it is a long term investment? Or should I take more risks since I am still very young? And whatever % I don’t invest into FXAIX - what should I do with that money? For example - if I invest 80% of my money into FXAIX and have 20% of it left, should the 20% be split up into gold, silver, crypto, NASDAQ, etc.? I mainly just want to know what I should invest in, since there are so many junk videos on YouTube telling me to invest everything into the “next big crypto currency” and I don’t know what I should listen to. I want to have some variety but at the same time have a good portion of my account be based on the S&P 500. I don‘t like the idea of day-trading because of the risk, but I do want to take some risks on possibly specific, small tech funds or single companies… etc, even if this is just 1-2% of my money (ex: my friend told me to invest in BBAI, which seems extremely risky. I’d be fine investing in this, just not with most of my money). Any specific stocks or funds? Businesses? Real estate (not that I have enough for that at the moment). Last thing - should I invest outside of the U.S. too? Likely because of the way google searches are made to fit your location, I haven’t really been hearing much about investing outside of the U.S. Is this important to do? If anyone is kind enough to share exactly what their portfolio looks like too - that would be awesome! Thank you everyone.",

      "selftext_processed": "I currently have a youth brokerage account on Fidelity and I have about 56 % of my money invested in FXAIX the SP 500 fund of Fidelity . I ’ m unsure what I should do with the rest of it the other 44 % . I don ’ t have a job am underage so I am not_getting the same tax benefits someone with a Roth IRA would get . That is fine once I get a job am older I will transfer the money from FXAIX into a Roth IRA . I don ’ t know how or where I should invest at my age ... I think I want to save what I have right now primarily for retirement instead of for a house or other large payment since I know time in the market is the most important aspect of investing . Should I increase the % of my balance in FXAIX since it is a long term investment Or should I take more risks since I am still very young And whatever % I don ’ t invest into FXAIX what should I do with that money For example if I invest 80 % of my money into FXAIX and have 20 % of it left should the 20 % be split up into gold silver crypto NASDAQ etc . I mainly just want to know what I should invest in since there are so many junk videos on YouTube telling me to invest everything into the “ next big crypto currency ” and I don ’ t know what I should listen to . I want to have some variety but at the same time have a good portion of my account be based on the SP 500 . I don ‘ t like the idea of daytrading because of the risk but I do want to take some risks on possibly specific small tech funds or single companies… etc even if this is just 12 % of my money ex my friend told me to invest in BBAI which seems extremely risky . I ’ d be fine investing in this just not_with most of my money . Any specific stocks or funds Businesses Real estate not that I have enough for that at the moment . Last thing should I invest outside of the U.S. too Likely because of the way google searches are made to fit your location I haven ’ t really been hearing much about investing outside of the U.S. Is this important to do If anyone is kind enough to share exactly what their portfolio looks like too that would be awesome Thank you everyone ."
