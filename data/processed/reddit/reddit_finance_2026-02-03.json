      "selftext": "I don't necessarily believe that this will happen. However, if it does happen, it will be a hard time for all. The Fed was late to hike rates back in 2022 when inflation was rising. During that time, despite CPI being at 5%, they said inflation was transitory. The full effects of rate changes, from one extreme to another, take an awful long time to see their full effects. Fed funds were cut to 0% in April of 2020. They did not realize inflation was a problem until 2022, almost a year and a half later. During this time, the stock market had ripped 115% from the COVID lows, people were buying houses before seeing them, and offering 50-100k over asking. NFT's and the metaverse became a big thing as well, which, as it turned out, was absolutely garbage. Stocks like RIVN, GME, and AMC became hyperbolic. Yes, the Ukraine invasion and the consequent block of Russia added to the cause. I will address this a bit further down. There was a bubble. The stock market finally corrected 25%, meme stocks went down, and mortgage rates went up, putting a stop to the overly high demand for buying houses. Fed funds later peak at 5.25-5.5 in August of 2023. He then cuts rates to 3.5-3.75, Powell continues to say that we are at a comfortable range to hold. If true, this is their version of \"inflation was transitory\". The supreme court is to make a decision on the tariffs being upheld; i believe this is the \"ukraine moment\" to deflation. Supply will rush, causing higher supply and lower prices. AI is another plausible accelerator to lowering service costs. The fact is that inflation has already been lowered, from 9% to 2-3%. Any lessening of cutting rates, combined with supreme court's decision, will unleash a fury of chaos. As the regime shifts, gold and silver coming down might be the first sign of this. Deflation is the lowering of prices; gold and silver's prices are lower in past few trading days. Historically, gold had performed well during deflationary cycles; however, that is in the past. Gold was used as a means of wealth. The main question is, just like bitcoin, is gold a shiny object syndrome? Food for thought. The left tail is always fat. Per Powell, the tail is always fatter than what you think it is. I think there is a conversation to have about deflation. I also think that there is a probability of resurgence of inflation (tariffs working through the supply chain + the lack of data due to government shut down (mostly shelter)).",

The Fed was late to hike rates back in 2022 when inflation was rising . During that time despite CPI being at 5 % they said inflation was transitory . The full effects of rate changes from one extreme to another take an awful long time to see their full effects . Fed funds were cut to 0 % in April of 2020 . They did not_realize inflation was a problem until 2022 almost a year and a half later . During this time the stock market had ripped 115 % from the COVID lows people were buying houses before seeing them and offering 50100k over asking . NFTs and the metaverse became a big thing as well which as it turned out was absolutely garbage . Stocks like RIVN GME and AMC became hyperbolic . Yes the Ukraine invasion and the consequent block of Russia added to the cause . I will address this a bit further down . There was a bubble . The stock market finally corrected 25 % meme stocks went down and mortgage rates went up putting a stop to the overly high demand for buying houses . Fed funds later peak at 5.255.5 in August of 2023 . He then cuts rates to 3.53.75 Powell continues to say that we are at a comfortable range to hold . If true this is their version of inflation was transitory . The supreme court is to make a decision on the tariffs being upheld i believe this is the ukraine moment to deflation . Supply will rush causing higher supply and lower prices . AI is another plausible accelerator to lowering service costs . The fact is that inflation has already been lowered from 9 % to 23 % . Any lessening of cutting rates combined with supreme courts decision will unleash a fury of chaos . As the regime shifts gold and silver coming down might be the first sign of this . Deflation is the lowering of prices gold and silvers prices are lower in past few trading days . Historically gold had performed well during deflationary cycles however that is in the past . Gold was used as a means of wealth . The main question is just like bitcoin is gold a shiny object syndrome Food for thought . The left tail is always fat . Per Powell the tail is always fatter than what you think it is . I think there is a conversation to have about deflation . I also think that there is a probability of resurgence of inflation tariffs working through the supply chain the lack of data due to government shut down mostly shelter ."

The basic idea is simple but impactful: help customers get the right size without guesswork, which could drastically cut return rates for clothing and shoes. It feels like a small part of the e-commerce ecosystem, but the market is huge. If retailers adopt these tools widely, it could meaningfully improve conversions and customer satisfaction. Has anyone here been following $MYSZ or seen how their solutions are performing with big online retailers? Curious to hear thoughts on whether this is just a niche tech play or if it could scale into something bigger.",

      "title": "How much total wealth is now bubble wealth? Are we at a high?",
      "selftext": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth. I'd define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on non-producing assets without an underlying, historical, or productive market value. Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone, can collapse when the faith vanishes, with nobody willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse. In fact, there's no concept of a 'bargain' for a bubble commodity. Once the faith is gone, the value is gone. Real wealth examples: * real estate that people live in, using money from jobs. Or functioning commercial real estate. * stocks with a historically non-insane PE (say, less than 25 or 30). Yes, there's an exception for genuine likelihood of growth. * gold at historical prices (gold is faith based, but it's 10,000 years of faith). * dollars, exchangeable for above, as long as inflation is sane. * Dutch tulips c. 1635; Beanie Babies c. 1995. Bubble wealth examples: * the part of gold price above its historical norm, say $2500 (ie, a bit over plateau before 2024). Gold's current bubble value would be $16T using total amount of gold in existence; but only 22% is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits, so maybe just $3T. * most of silver's current price, but most of silver is in non-investment form. Silver has a $5T total cap, but only 5% is held as coin or bullion, so ignore silver. * cryptocurrency. Current bubble value $2.6T, assuming all crypto is hokum. * the $3T of AI infrastructure build-up could be bubble wealth, in full or in part. * real estate used to park money, that could not be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition. Bubble value: very hard to guess; the total [value of real estate shot up from $30T to $50T after covid,( when CPI says it should have gone to 38T, so there's $12T of bubble value maybe, unless the increase of prices is fundamental. * stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA - I'd say TSLA is 90% bubble but hard to say for NVDA. 50%? Anyway, maybe $4T just for these, then a bunch of other stocks, at various bubble fractions. * one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 20-25 (?) and today's value of 30 is bubble wealth, so at least 20% of the US market ($14T) is bubble wealth, but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated, and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up, with bargain hunters waiting to pile on. So let's not count the high current P/E, or discount its bubbliness by a lot. The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly, however. So there seems to be at least $20T of faith-based wealth out there, perhaps 65% of US GDP. The stock market lost $8T (equivalent to $12T today) in 2008; it lost $5T ($10T today) in 2000. Housing lost something like $6T in 2008, suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of today's bubble wealth. Comments? Are we in a record era bubble wealth? Or is this the wrong way to look at things?",

      "selftext_processed": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth . Id define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on nonproducing assets without an underlying historical or productive market value . Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone can collapse when the faith vanishes with nobody_willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse . In fact theres no_concept of a bargain for a bubble commodity . Once the faith is gone the value is gone . Real wealth examples real estate that people live in using money from jobs . Or functioning commercial real estate . stocks with a historically noninsane PE say less than 25 or 30 . Yes theres an exception for genuine likelihood of growth . gold at historical prices gold is faith based but its 10000 years of faith . dollars exchangeable for above as long as inflation is sane . Dutch tulips c. 1635 Beanie Babies c. 1995 . Bubble wealth examples the part of gold price above its historical norm say $ 2500 ie a bit over plateau before 2024 . Golds current bubble value would be $ 16T using total amount of gold in existence but only 22 % is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits so maybe just $ 3T . most of silvers current price but most of silver is in noninvestment form . Silver has a $ 5T total cap but only 5 % is held as coin or bullion so ignore silver . cryptocurrency . Current bubble value $ 2.6T assuming all crypto is hokum . the $ 3T of AI infrastructure buildup could be bubble wealth in full or in part . real estate used to park money that could not_be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition . Bubble value very hard to guess the total value of real estate shot up from $ 30T to $ 50T after covid when CPI says it should have gone to 38T so theres $ 12T of bubble value maybe unless the increase of prices is fundamental . stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA Id say TSLA is 90 % bubble but hard to say for NVDA . 50 % Anyway maybe $ 4T just for these then a bunch of other stocks at various bubble fractions . one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 2025 and todays value of 30 is bubble wealth so at least 20 % of the US market $ 14T is bubble wealth but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up with bargain hunters waiting to pile on . So lets not_count the high current PE or discount its bubbliness by a lot . The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly however . So there seems to be at least $ 20T of faithbased wealth out there perhaps 65 % of US GDP . The stock market lost $ 8T equivalent to $ 12T today in 2008 it lost $ 5T $ 10T today in 2000 . Housing lost something like $ 6T in 2008 suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of todays bubble wealth . Comments Are we in a record era bubble wealth Or is this the wrong way to look at things"

      "selftext": "So with RACE hitting a new 52 week low last month, I’m trying to understand what’s going on with the stock. The stock initially got jack hammered because of weak guidance for their 2030 revenue outlook, which gave people a scare about whether Ferrari still had room for growth or not. I’m currently holding and adding to my position but it seems like sentiment around the stock isn’t changing much. Is the stock somewhat in a holding period where it’s waiting to see what Ferrari will do next or is it waiting to see how the geopolitics play out? I mean on the bullish side they have absolute 100% control of the supply side of the demand curve so it’s not like they’re having issues with production, they’ve got that multi year waitlist for the exclusive stuff, and they’ve pretty much gotten the lifestyle aspect down pretty good between the fashion, and their theme park. Wanna see what everyone else thinks about it. It’s just a super interesting stock to me.",

The stock initially got jack hammered because of weak guidance for their 2030 revenue outlook which gave people a scare about whether Ferrari still had room for growth or not_I ’ m currently holding and adding to my position but it seems like sentiment around the stock isn ’ t changing much . Is the stock somewhat in a holding period where it ’ s waiting to see what Ferrari will do next or is it waiting to see how the geopolitics play out I mean on the bullish side they have absolute 100 % control of the supply side of the demand curve so it ’ s not_like they ’ re having issues with production they ’ ve got that multi year waitlist for the exclusive stuff and they ’ ve pretty much gotten the lifestyle aspect down pretty good between the fashion and their theme park . Wan na see what everyone else thinks about it . It ’ s just a super interesting stock to me ."

Theme parks are performing incredibly well, streaming finally turned profitable with meaningful margin expansion. But investors seem spooked by Iger's exit and who's taking over. Is this a buying opportunity on leadership FUD, or are the succession concerns legitimate enough to avoid DIS until there's clarity?

I speak to our friends who feel like they are also going through the same things. It feels like such a façade seeing the stock market rise so heavily in hearing that economy is doing so well when I feel like most of the Americans, I speak to believe that their lives have been getting worse. Interesting article to read but PE ratio for the SP500 is at roughly 40 which was the similar PE when the stock market corrected in the dot com bubble and 2008. That’s why companies like Microsoft got punished, even though they beat expectations. Time to sell and keep cash, I have a bad feeling about this $7000. The stakes, in short, are high for bulls to eclipse the 7,000 psychological hurdle, and then hold it. The last time we tested 7,000 was Jan. 28, and markets quickly retrenched. What are y’all thinking?",

I speak to our friends who feel like they are also going through the same things . It feels like such a façade seeing the stock market rise so heavily in hearing that economy is doing so well when I feel like most of the Americans I speak to believe that their lives have been getting worse . Interesting article to read but PE ratio for the SP500 is at roughly 40 which was the similar PE when the stock market corrected in the dot com bubble and 2008 . That ’ s why companies like Microsoft got punished even though they beat expectations . Time to sell and keep cash I have a bad feeling about this $ 7000 . The stakes in short are high for bulls to eclipse the 7000 psychological hurdle and then hold it . The last time we tested 7000 was Jan. 28 and markets quickly retrenched . What are y ’ all thinking"

      "title": "TTD isn’t a Turn Around Story",
      "selftext": "TTD is polarizing. Some believe it to be significantly undervalued. Others believe it’s still a hefty premium. If one were to simply look at TTD finacials they’d be confused. Low debt, high profits, revenue but slowing growth, decent mote…so what gives. Some believe TTD to still be Overvalued. It’s priced like Amazon but with increased competition,3 CFO’s leaving in one year. Shrinking margins and a singular mote that’s lost its edge. I’m on the bearish side now, here’s what made me reconsider my investment with this company Amazon is a new competitor, i believe it will take business away from TTD. Why do I think this? Because Amazon is offering an ideal product at an 80percent cheaper price. If I’m looking to advertise between TTD and Amazon 9/10 I’m going with Amazon. I think the walled garden dismissal of Amazon is a critical mistake on the investors part. Many current clients of TTD may not want to pay out 80percent more because of some conspiracy like conflict of interest. Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor, it’s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration. Secondly at least half of TTD clients could potentially be lost because of the significant difference in pricing. TTD will have to lower margins to compete against Amazon eventually even to maintain its current clientele. Some will argue that Walmart doesn’t want to advertise on Amazon because of whole-foods but who says they go with TTD? It seems like this field is ever more competitive with each year. The CEO of TTD is no Bezos. When you believe in a company and you genuinely believe it’s a diamond in a rough time/your baby I’d want a CEO that shows up for his company. Jeff Green worth 2.3Billion is anything but communicative with investors/shareholders. I want you to think about this, Jeff Green has only sold shares in the past years of TTD but has never bought any shares. I understand he gets stock based Comp, but he sold 181million dollars last year. Think about this for one second and it becomes obvious. \\*if you the CEO believe your company is being wrongly priced having access to financials after a singificant correction in your stock you’d be buying with that insight hand over fist. That is what a good CEO DOES,not sell exessively Jeff Green has sold 500million dollars worth of shares since 2021(4.3million shares) . He now has 1.3million. He couldn’t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction? He gets paid in stock comp, okay explain Why TF you’d sell 500million worth and not buy back in at a far lower price? Because he doesn’t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he’d value it at that’s why. I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who’s been radio silent this entire year and hasn’t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he’s withdrawn? What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways? For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021(Nvidia CEO/most expensive company). 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year, I’ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread. [ ]( So CEO sucks, mote is dying, margins will compress, higher PE than Amazon, leading me to believe TTD is still overvalued. I would like to preface I could be wrong, some may disagree, this is what I believe. This could be a tailwind for TTD but I Think It’s more of an impending doom on the horizon for TTD. I highly encourage different perspectives and not 2nd grade jabs,uninspired snide rhetoric Reddit/what gets me likes. i hope to see your opinions and thoughts on this company.",

      "selftext_processed": "TTD is polarizing . Some believe it to be significantly undervalued . Others believe it ’ s still a hefty premium . If one were to simply look at TTD finacials they ’ d be confused . Low debt high profits revenue but slowing growth decent mote…so what gives . Some believe TTD to still be Overvalued . It ’ s priced like Amazon but with increased competition3 CFO ’ s leaving in one year . Shrinking margins and a singular mote that ’ s lost its edge . I ’ m on the bearish side now here ’ s what made me reconsider my investment with this company Amazon is a new competitor i believe it will take business away from TTD . Why do I think this Because Amazon is offering an ideal product at an 80percent cheaper price . If I ’ m looking to advertise between TTD and Amazon 910 I ’ m going with Amazon . I think the walled garden dismissal of Amazon is a critical mistake on the investors part . Many current clients of TTD may not_want to pay out 80percent more because of some conspiracy like conflict of interest . Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor it ’ s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration . Secondly at least half of TTD clients could potentially be lost because of the significant difference in pricing . TTD will have to lower margins to compete against Amazon eventually even to maintain its current clientele . Some will argue that Walmart doesn ’ t want to advertise on Amazon because of wholefoods but who says they go with TTD It seems like this field is ever more competitive with each year . The CEO of TTD is no_Bezos . When you believe in a company and you genuinely believe it ’ s a diamond in a rough timeyour baby I ’ d want a CEO that shows up for his company . Jeff Green worth 2.3Billion is anything but communicative with investorsshareholders . I want you to think about this Jeff Green has only sold shares in the past years of TTD but has never_bought any shares . I understand he gets stock based Comp but he sold 181million dollars last year . Think about this for one second and it becomes obvious . if you the CEO believe your company is being wrongly priced having access to financials after a singificant correction in your stock you ’ d be buying with that insight hand over fist . That is what a good CEO DOESnot sell exessively Jeff Green has sold 500million dollars worth of shares since 20214.3million shares . He now has 1.3million . He couldn ’ t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction He gets paid in stock comp okay explain Why TF you ’ d sell 500million worth and not_buy back in at a far lower price Because he doesn ’ t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he ’ d value it at that ’ s why . I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who ’ s been radio silent this entire year and hasn ’ t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he ’ s withdrawn What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021Nvidia CEOmost expensive company . 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year I ’ ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread . So CEO sucks mote is dying margins will compress higher PE than Amazon leading me to believe TTD is still overvalued . I would like to preface I could be wrong some may disagree this is what I believe . This could be a tailwind for TTD but I Think It ’ s more of an impending doom on the horizon for TTD . I highly encourage different perspectives and not_2nd grade jabsuninspired snide rhetoric Redditwhat gets me likes . i hope to see your opinions and thoughts on this company ."

      "title": "Silver market : biggest trap ever ?",
      "selftext": "I'm trying to learn a bit about the silver market. And the first thing that caught my attention is the fact that the silver market is considered heavily manipulated. Indeed, more than 90% of investors only buy paper silver to bet on the price of silver. They have no intention of owning physical silver. As a result, the COMEX can simply use its leverage to manipulate the paper price movements. And every time the price of silver has risen sharply for X reasons (often speculative), the COMEX has always managed to change the rules to kill the silver price. Today, people are saying it's different because there's a shortage in COMEX reserves and the physical price in certain places, especially Shanghai, is varying between $120 and $130. Indeed, this year China has placed small orders to withdraw massive amounts of physical silver from the COMEX. However, that doesn't change the rules of the game at all. Physical silver demand is far greater than supply, and yet the silver price hasn't particularly increased. The only thing that has driven up COMEX prices is the Chinese intervention. And the COMEX has issued several successive margin calls to keep the silver price quite low. What about physical silver? From what I understand, mines don't sell at the true physical price. They sell at the paper silver price. Sometimes they build up stocks to sell later, anticipating higher prices. But paper silver prices always remain the compass for long-term contracts. So even if physical silver is selling for $130 in Shanghai, a Canadian mining company will sell it for $70 per ounce because the COMEX has kept the price down. In fact, I get the impression that this market is rotten. We're not investing in silver, but in a totally manipulated financial product.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im trying to learn a bit about the silver market . And the first thing that caught my attention is the fact that the silver market is considered heavily manipulated . Indeed more than 90 % of investors only buy paper silver to bet on the price of silver . They have no_intention of owning physical silver . As a result the COMEX can simply use its leverage to manipulate the paper price movements . And every time the price of silver has risen sharply for X reasons often speculative the COMEX has always managed to change the rules to kill the silver price . Today people are saying its different because theres a shortage in COMEX reserves and the physical price in certain places especially Shanghai is varying between $ 120 and $ 130 . Indeed this year China has placed small orders to withdraw massive amounts of physical silver from the COMEX . However that doesnt change the rules of the game at all . Physical silver demand is far greater than supply and yet the silver price hasnt particularly increased . The only thing that has driven up COMEX prices is the Chinese intervention . And the COMEX has issued several successive margin calls to keep the silver price quite low . What about physical silver From what I understand mines dont sell at the true physical price . They sell at the paper silver price . Sometimes they build up stocks to sell later anticipating higher prices . But paper silver prices always remain the compass for longterm contracts . So even if physical silver is selling for $ 130 in Shanghai a Canadian mining company will sell it for $ 70 per ounce because the COMEX has kept the price down . In fact I get the impression that this market is rotten . Were not_investing in silver but in a totally manipulated financial product ."

      "selftext": "Ever catch yourself rolling your eyes when your girlfriend talks about one of her friends and says, “She’s such a Sagittarius”? How different is that from your buddy saying price is definitely going down because there’s a bear flag, and the Ichimoku Cloud, and MACD, and RSI, and Stochastic all line up? Both sound confident. Both sound convincing. Both explain uncertainty with a neat story. And before you jump in with “that’s such an Aquarius thing to say”, yes, it probably is. But stick with me. Astrology doesn’t work because stars control behaviour. It works because people recognise patterns, assign meaning to them, and then interpret everything through that meaning. Once the label exists, every action suddenly fits. Technical analysis often works the same way. Certain indicators matter because traders decided they matter. Levels hold because enough people expect them to. The belief comes first, the reaction follows. This illusion stays intact as long as nothing serious interrupts it. Then Trump comes out and announces another war. Or tariffs. Or a new Fed chair. Or something no indicator was designed to anticipate. Suddenly the chart stops being the explanation. Price doesn’t care about clouds or oscillators. People react to fear, urgency, and risk. That doesn’t mean technical analysis is useless. Astrology isn’t useless either. Both help people navigate uncertainty when things are calm and familiar. The issue isn’t the tool, it’s taking it literally. When traders stop treating technical analysis as a tool and start treating it as truth, they do the same thing believers do. When it works, it’s proof. When it fails, it’s user error. This isn’t about men or women. Plenty of women trade technically and do it well. Plenty of men live by astrology and birth charts. This is about belief systems, not gender. So the real question isn’t whether technical analysis works. It’s whether you treat it like astrology, something you drop when reality breaks it, or something you defend anyway. Markets are fine with the first approach. They are ruthless with the second.",

So the real question isn ’ t whether technical analysis works . It ’ s whether you treat it like astrology something you drop when reality breaks it or something you defend anyway . Markets are fine with the first approach . They are ruthless with the second ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Oracle Corp. plans to raise $45 billion to $50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI’s growth. >Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company’s largest cloud customers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp., OpenAI, TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp., the company said in a statement Sunday. >The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligence-linked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off. The company’s shares have fallen around 50% from its record price on Sept. 10, wiping out roughly $460 billion in market value. >Shares fell about 3% in premarket trading on Monday. Oracle’s stock had declined 2.6% to close at $164.58 in New York on Friday. >Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle’s free cash flow negative, where it is expected to stay until 2030, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years, largely on semiconductors and leases. >“If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. >The company plans to raise half of the funds via equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an at-the-market equity program of as much as $20 billion. >Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investment-grade debt rating, wrote John DiFucci, an analyst at Guggenheim, in a January note. >The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026. The company borrowed $18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year’s largest corporate bond offerings. >But the debt market may not have an appetite for this much investment-grade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps, Luria said. Issuing equity may also hurt the company’s stock price, he said. >Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering, Oracle said. >As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble, investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle, which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. >A key part of Oracle’s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI, which has committed to spending about $300 billion to rent servers from Oracle. OpenAI is not profitable, adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns. >Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle. The timing, “could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday’s open,” Luria said. *Processing img uc3th276y2hg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Oracle Corp. plans to raise $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI ’ s growth . Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company ’ s largest cloud customers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. Nvidia Corp. OpenAI TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp. the company said in a statement Sunday . The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligencelinked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off . The company ’ s shares have fallen around 50 % from its record price on Sept. 10 wiping out roughly $ 460 billion in market value . Shares fell about 3 % in premarket trading on Monday . Oracle ’ s stock had declined 2.6 % to close at $ 164.58 in New York on Friday . Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle ’ s free cash flow negative where it is expected to stay until 2030 according to data compiled by Bloomberg . The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years largely on semiconductors and leases . “ If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in ” said Gil Luria an analyst at DA Davidson Co . The company plans to raise half of the funds via equitylinked and common equity issuances including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an atthemarket equity program of as much as $ 20 billion . Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investmentgrade debt rating wrote John DiFucci an analyst at Guggenheim in a January note . The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026 . The company borrowed $ 18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year ’ s largest corporate bond offerings . But the debt market may not_have an appetite for this much investmentgrade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps Luria said . Issuing equity may also hurt the company ’ s stock price he said . Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the atthemarket issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering Oracle said . As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis . A key part of Oracle ’ s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI which has committed to spending about $ 300 billion to rent servers from Oracle . OpenAI is not_profitable adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns . Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle . The timing “ could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday ’ s open ” Luria said .

      "selftext": "BARK Inc., is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to go-private in a all-cash transaction. The first proposal: BARK stock started 2025 at $2 with a continuous drop until $0.60. The Co-Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $0.60 and pushed the stock price down. A few weeks later, the CEO with the insiders made a go-private offer at $0.90 per share. They control nearly 39% of BARK already. Their offer was a relief for some retail holders, as it was nearly 50% higher than the current sp then. But, it was actually a low-ball offer for a artificially beaten down stock. The second proposal: In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $0.90, another major shareholder, Shay Capital, criticized the management and made two proposals: First, its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors, Second, a stock buy-back up to $25 million, as in their opinion, BARK stock price at $0.90 was very undervalued. A few days later than the CEO/insiders proposal at $0.90, Klugman with Marcus Lemonis (CEO of BBBY) made their buyout proposal at $1.10 per share. (Remember, Klugman does not accept the $0.90. He stated that in October. Then he said the sp at $0.90 is too low). So, there are two parties, already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders, who will try to acquire the company. They are both serious: \\-CEO/insiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a low-ball offer following it. \\-Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis. \\-Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff, a pet firm with retail stores. He grew Bentley with many acquisitions. Bentley sell pet foods, but don't make its own. BARK is making pet foods, so the synergies between these two are obvious. Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH, acquiring/delisting a company, merged it, re-listing it again. I think it will take time, but during times of uncertainty, the potential of a 22% gain from Klugman-Lemonis offer and the secured CEO/insiders offer bring a great risk/reward ratio. BARK currently trades at $0.89 and it dropped even at $0.85. These prices are below both offers. The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $1.10. Until then, both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down. Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th, but they are not important anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "BARK Inc. is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to goprivate in a allcash transaction . The first proposal BARK stock started 2025 at $ 2 with a continuous drop until $ 0.60 . The CoFounder Executive Chairman CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $ 0.60 and pushed the stock price down . A few weeks later the CEO with the insiders made a goprivate offer at $ 0.90 per share . They control nearly 39 % of BARK already . Their offer was a relief for some retail holders as it was nearly 50 % higher than the current sp then . But it was actually a lowball offer for a artificially beaten down stock . The second proposal In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $ 0.90 another major shareholder Shay Capital criticized the management and made two proposals First its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors Second a stock buyback up to $ 25 million as in their opinion BARK stock price at $ 0.90 was very undervalued . A few days later than the CEOinsiders proposal at $ 0.90 Klugman with Marcus Lemonis CEO of BBBY made their buyout proposal at $ 1.10 per share . Remember Klugman does not_accept the $ 0.90 . He stated that in October . Then he said the sp at $ 0.90 is too low . So there are two parties already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders who will try to acquire the company . They are both serious CEOinsiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a lowball offer following it . Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis . Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff a pet firm with retail stores . He grew Bentley with many acquisitions . Bentley sell pet foods but dont make its own . BARK is making pet foods so the synergies between these two are obvious . Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH acquiringdelisting a company merged it relisting it again . I think it will take time but during times of uncertainty the potential of a 22 % gain from KlugmanLemonis offer and the secured CEOinsiders offer bring a great riskreward ratio . BARK currently trades at $ 0.89 and it dropped even at $ 0.85 . These prices are below both offers . The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $ 1.10 . Until then both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down . Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th but they are not_important anymore ."

Some news outlets are framing the Federal Reserve’s latest fed chef replacement proposal as evidence that the dollar is becoming significantly stronger. I find that misleading. Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn’t signal a strong dollar especially not merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place. What we need is real fiscal progress, not just new faces saying things are improving. I’m not convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem.

      "selftext": "Oil prices moved lower after investors started backing away from worst-case supply disruption scenarios. The drop followed comments from Donald Trump over the weekend, where he told reporters that Tehran is “seriously talking” with the U.S. That seems to have taken some of the geopolitical risk premium out of crude, at least for now. Markets had been pricing in tighter supply on fears of escalation in the Middle East, but signs of possible diplomacy are pushing traders to reassess those assumptions. For the moment, it looks like sentiment is shifting from “brace for disruption” to “wait and see.” Still feels fragile though headlines are doing most of the driving here, and that can flip fast.

The drop followed comments from Donald Trump over the weekend where he told reporters that Tehran is “ seriously talking ” with the U.S. That seems to have taken some of the geopolitical risk premium out of crude at least for now . Markets had been pricing in tighter supply on fears of escalation in the Middle East but signs of possible diplomacy are pushing traders to reassess those assumptions . For the moment it looks like sentiment is shifting from “ brace for disruption ” to “ wait and see. ” Still feels fragile though headlines are doing most of the driving here and that can flip fast .

Spot gold fell nearly 10% on Friday, while silver saw an even steeper drop of around 30%, marking one of its biggest short-term moves in years. The continued weakness suggests that last week’s rout wasn’t just a one-day event. Some of the pressure appears to be coming from profit-taking after a strong run earlier this year, along with shifting expectations around interest rates and the U.S. dollar. When yields move higher and the dollar strengthens, precious metals often struggle. Silver’s move stands out in particular, given its dual role as both a precious metal and an industrial input. That makes it more sensitive to changes in growth expectations and broader risk sentiment. For now, it looks like traders are reassessing positioning in metals after a crowded rally.

All the news are on how other countries are hoarding precious metals, dumping US debt. How the great tech companies are moving billions of dollars around between themselves to make it seem there is grown and investment. All this AI momentum seems like a fever dream, lacking infrastructure and most of all, the power to run it. Just recently one of this big tech CEOs admitted they have the hardware but not the power. Under this confession, it is clear why they are so desperate to reignite old nuclear plants and create small \"portable\" nuclear ones that are easier to build and transport. This things not only take time, they take gigantic sumes of money and resources. Big tech won't publicly say they are struggling, instead, they will lay off personnel to cover their losses and stay afloat. In January alone we had 26k tech jobs lay offs. I'm afraid this trend will continue through the year. All this to say, I want to preserve my gains before the next stock crash event and physical gold seemsto be a safe place for it, specially if it's money I do not have a need to use in a few years from now. There is also the crypto option, but I would prefer a more tangible investment. I guess what I want advice is, should I wait a bit longer and see if global events trigger a final grow or cut the cord, transform the gains in gold to preserve the wealth and wait for a market crash to jump again and buy low. Thank you in advance.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am strongly thinking about selling my 53 shares of Nvidia and use that money to buy physical gold . All the news are on how other countries are hoarding precious metals dumping US debt . How the great tech companies are moving billions of dollars around between themselves to make it seem there is grown and investment . All this AI momentum seems like a fever dream lacking infrastructure and most of all the power to run it . Just recently one of this big tech CEOs admitted they have the hardware but not_the power . Under this confession it is clear why they are so desperate to reignite old nuclear plants and create small portable nuclear ones that are easier to build and transport . This things not_only take time they take gigantic sumes of money and resources . Big tech wont publicly say they are struggling instead they will lay off personnel to cover their losses and stay afloat . In January alone we had 26k tech jobs lay offs . Im afraid this trend will continue through the year . All this to say I want to preserve my gains before the next stock crash event and physical gold seemsto be a safe place for it specially if its money I do not_have a need to use in a few years from now . There is also the crypto option but I would prefer a more tangible investment . I guess what I want advice is should I wait a bit longer and see if global events trigger a final grow or cut the cord transform the gains in gold to preserve the wealth and wait for a market crash to jump again and buy low . Thank you in advance ."

      "selftext": "*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)* ***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.*** ***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.*** ***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.*** Hola fellow regards, If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.]( It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares. Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point. [Quite a return if you ask me.]( Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… # Rich Sparkle is a \"printing company\" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all. With a consideration of nearly $975 million dollars, most would think that Rich Sparkle is, in some way, a firm that’s engaged within the social media or technology space. Maybe an A.I influencer company or something? It’s what I thought too, but Rich Sparkle’s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements. Yes. Printing and designing financial statements. [Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th, 2025.]( A financial statements printing company is paying $975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok’s most popular influencer. What’s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they’re paying Khaby Lame for this company. The company only raked in just $5.88m in revenue the previous year, yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars? [Again, per the prospectus.]( [Listed on the prospectus, ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade.]( $ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th, 2025, raising just **$5m in IPO proceeds** [**(6-k pg.11)**]( The company issued out just 10% of their current shares, which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $50m come the time of the IPO (shares would eventually dilute out to \\~5% of outstanding shares being publicly traded). Just a month later, the stock that initially IPO'd at price of around $4 is trading at [$30 bucks and has added nearly $250m in market capitalization]( with literally no material events happening within that time that neither EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too. Inexplicably [the ticker just... stays in that price range for no real reason at all, no material events, nothing]( for the next few months. That changes on December 15th, 2025. [6-k on December 15th.]( The auditor for Rich Sparkle, Wei Wei & Co, resigned as Sparkle's auditor [effective immediately. ]( wouldn't be too much of a problem (for a company of their stature) if it weren't for the fact that the company has [filed notice that their 20-F is going to come late.]( The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only [one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn (who only has one follower), despite being an American company,]( and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with [zero followers]( and [filler posts that are just stock images]( I'm not one to want to cyberbully a small business, but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company (as of 2/1/26) that just did a $975m acquisition... yeah that's a bit sketchy. # The biggest IPO Sparkle's underwriter got involved in... was historic for all the wrong reasons. I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece I'm working on. This section is where I'll clear that up. The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money, would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares. [Per prospectus]( Eddid Securities. [Their website]( says that they help bring small to medium-size companies to the market, stuff the big investment banks don't have the time for. *Small to medium-size companies*, with the exception of one. [Ain't that a lovely throwback]( To any WSBers that were here during 2022, I'm sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you. Their subsidiary, Digital, randomly skyrocketed 30,000% within the span of mere weeks in July-August 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The only problem is that no one exactly knew how this was even possible, and no, it wasn't a meme stock as the media often claimed. AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kong-related stocks (Regencell, Addentax, etc) that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $400b+ at its peak only to dump 90% right after. The guy behind the IPO, Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO, and, a year and a half before, was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of China's biggest investment firms, CMIG. This feud was so public, CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a *fraudster they shouldn't invest with.* [one of us if I'm being real 😶‍🌫️]( While AMTD's stock surge still hasn't been publicly explained yet, it's pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider co-ordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola, Facebook, and Walmart (no I'm not joking) within the span of weeks. The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process? Looking at the underwriting records, where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process ([prospectus]( [Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022]( Of course, this isn't definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital, but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with, while also considering that $ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider co-ordination. AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC (Hong Kong's version of the SEC). They recently got fined for failing to [produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market.]( Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to \"*have lost records and books relating to the listing of multi-million dollar companies*\" # Conclusion. I'm not here to make any definitive claims, but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is, and that the media is not reporting on any of it, at all. With the clear influencer angle, and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has, I feel like it's hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that don't really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally *cooked*. Anyways, hope you enjoyed this write-up. I'm out.",

      "selftext_processed": "For disclosure I dont hold any position in $ ANPA nor do I plan to . I wrote this write up since I found it interesting and also intersects with other work Im doing TLDR Khaby Lame the mostfollowed creator on TikTok sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $ 6m in revenue ... yes this is real . A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publiclyknown employee and hardly any public presence . The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most highprofile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs . Simply put the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets . Hola fellow regards If you ’ ve been reading the news lately you might ’ ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok ’ s most followed creator Khaby Lame selling his name and likeness for just shy of a billion dollars . It ’ s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame ’ s success story . The laidoff machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars looks built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal . According to the SEC filing Khaby Lame sold Step Distinctive Limited from a Hong Kongbased holding company Rich Sparkle Limited for the consideration of $ 975m USD through the issuance of 75m ordinary shares of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive ’ s shareholders . No_cash got exchanged at all purely shares . Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ ANPA and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing up to 600 % from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point . Quite a return if you ask me . Yet take an actual dive into the company that ’ s acquiring Khaby ’ s company and more specifically who even underwrote them within the first place and you ’ re going to get a picture filled with so many redflags you ’ d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… Rich Sparkle is a printing company that has no_business making a deal of this nature ... like at all . With a consideration of nearly $ 975 million dollars most would think that Rich Sparkle is in some way a firm that ’ s engaged within the social media or technology space . Maybe an A.I influencer company or something It ’ s what I thought too but Rich Sparkle ’ s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements . Yes . Printing and designing financial statements . Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th 2025 . A financial statements printing company is paying $ 975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok ’ s most popular influencer . What ’ s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they ’ re paying Khaby Lame for this company . The company only raked in just $ 5.88m in revenue the previous year yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars Again per the prospectus . Listed on the prospectus ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade . $ ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th 2025 raising just $ 5m in IPO proceeds 6k pg.11 The company issued out just 10 % of their current shares which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $ 50m come the time of the IPO shares would eventually dilute out to 5 % of outstanding shares being publicly traded . Just a month later the stock that initially IPOd at price of around $ 4 is trading at $ 30 bucks and has added nearly $ 250m in market capitalization with literally no_material events happening within that time that neither_EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too . Inexplicably the ticker just ... stays in that price range for no_real reason at all no_material events nothing_for the next few months . That changes on December 15th 2025 . 6k on December 15th . The auditor for Rich Sparkle Wei Wei Co resigned as Sparkles auditor effective immediately . wouldnt be too much of a problem for a company of their stature if it werent for the fact that the company has filed notice that their 20F is going to come late . The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn who only has one follower despite being an American company and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with zero followers and filler posts that are just stock images Im not_one to want to cyberbully a small business but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company as of 2126 that just did a $ 975m acquisition ... yeah thats a bit sketchy . The biggest IPO Sparkles underwriter got involved in ... was historic for all the wrong reasons . I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece Im working on . This section is where Ill clear that up . The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares . Per prospectus Eddid Securities . Their website says that they help bring small to mediumsize companies to the market stuff the big investment banks dont have the time for . Small to mediumsize companies with the exception of one . Aint that a lovely throwback To any WSBers that were here during 2022 Im sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you . Their subsidiary Digital randomly skyrocketed 30000 % within the span of mere weeks in JulyAugust 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world . The only problem is that no_one exactly knew how this was even possible and no_it wasnt a meme stock as the media often claimed . AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kongrelated stocks Regencell Addentax etc that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $ 400b at its peak only to dump 90 % right after . The guy behind the IPO Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO and a year and a half before was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of Chinas biggest investment firms CMIG . This feud was so public CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a fraudster they shouldnt invest with . one of us if Im being real 😶‍🌫️ While AMTDs stock surge still hasnt been publicly explained yet its pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider coordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola Facebook and Walmart no Im not_joking within the span of weeks . The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process Looking at the underwriting records where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process prospectus Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022 Of course this isnt definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with while also considering that $ ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider coordination . AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC Hong Kongs version of the SEC . They recently got fined for failing to produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market . Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to have lost records and books relating to the listing of multimillion dollar companies Conclusion . Im not_here to make any definitive claims but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is and that the media is not_reporting on any of it at all . With the clear influencer angle and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has I feel like its hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that dont really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally cooked . Anyways hope you enjoyed this writeup . Im out ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ Oracle Corporation (NYSE: [ORCL](#financial-modal)) today announced its full calendar year 2026 plan to fund the expansion of its rapidly growing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business. Oracle is raising money in order to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from our largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, xAI and others. Oracle expects to raise $45 to $50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year. The company plans to achieve its funding objective by using a balanced combination of debt and equity financing to maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet. On the equity side, Oracle plans to raise approximately half of its 2026 funding through a combination of equity-linked and common equity issuances. This is expected to include an initial issuance of mandatory convertible preferred securities, representing a modest portion of the overall equity funding, as well as a newly authorized at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The company plans to issue equity from the at-the-market program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices, based on market conditions and capital needs. On the debt side, Oracle intends to complete a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the company's planned funding for the year. Oracle does not expect to issue additional bonds during calendar year 2026 beyond this transaction. This funding plan reflects Oracle's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating, prudent capital allocation, balance sheet strength, and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business. These transactions have been approved by the Oracle Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering.",

Oracle is raising money in order to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from our largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers including AMD Meta NVIDIA OpenAI TikTok xAI and others . Oracle expects to raise $ 45 to $ 50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year . The company plans to achieve its funding objective by using a balanced combination of debt and equity financing to maintain a solid investmentgrade balance sheet . On the equity side Oracle plans to raise approximately half of its 2026 funding through a combination of equitylinked and common equity issuances . This is expected to include an initial issuance of mandatory convertible preferred securities representing a modest portion of the overall equity funding as well as a newly authorized atthemarket equity program of up to $ 20 billion . The company plans to issue equity from the atthemarket program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices based on market conditions and capital needs . On the debt side Oracle intends to complete a single onetime issuance of investmentgrade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the companys planned funding for the year . Oracle does not_expect to issue additional bonds during calendar year 2026 beyond this transaction . This funding plan reflects Oracles commitment to maintaining an investmentgrade rating prudent capital allocation balance sheet strength and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business . These transactions have been approved by the Oracle Board of Directors . Goldman Sachs Co. LLC will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering and Citigroup will be leading the atthemarket issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering ."

Shopify isn ’ t just a “ website builder ” anymore . It has effectively become the default infrastructure layer for small and mediumsized online businesses and increasingly for larger brands as well . For many merchants the decision isn ’ t whether to use Shopify but which Shopify plan to choose ."

As it turns out, I was right and deleveraging happened on Friday, January 30. And it is not as if central banks came and sold all their gold. Gold and silver are commodities has always been traded just based on demand and supply. However, the current rally has been fueled because momentum traders have started treating gold and silver now as securities. These traders buy huge amount of call options of the ETF even on margins rather than buying actual physical gold or silver. This leads to Market maker hedging their sold options, by buying the ton of shares of those ETFs which eventually drives up the artificially inflated prices. People are calling this rally as a Dollar debasement trade, however, behind the scenes just manipulation of some Wall Street traders is going on now. The government, Wall Street, media are all colluded. They orchestrate all such situations which leads to gold pumps News on wars, AI bubble, inflation, weak dollar. This cycle is similar to 1970s(nixon removing dollar to backed by gold) , 2008(GFC) and now this. In 1970 and 2008 cycle people lost faith in dollar, but over time dollar again became strong and now it is going through its next cycle. Physical gold buying has already slowed down because of the purchasing power has exhausted. Now only central banks are the buyers.",

      "selftext": "The extraordinary price action in metals on Friday was plastered with comments from ex JPM global head Marko Kolanovic warning of massive correction in Silver prices due this year. Interestingly his latest post on X intraday Jan 30 when the price action was unfolding was about SLV rebounding. Peter Schiff sounded similar note at close of trading on Friday. The price action esp for Silver was truly extraordinary. One for the record books however I don’t think the doom and gloom end of the world posts all over the web actually capture the underlying structural shifts that have been in play in the precious metals market over the last year. 1 - physical demand story for Silver is still intact. The AI buildout, industrial demand for solar, electronics is still there. The biggest global silver miner Fresnillo has actually cut its 2026 production guidance. Even on friday the physical silver premium in shanghai was over $20. 2026 like its predecessor years will be marred by shortfall in silver supply unable to match the demand forecasts. 2 - another major trigger for Friday’s price action was obviously announcement of Kevin Warsh as fed pick. Markets have immediately perceived him as an interest rate hawk on balance based on his previous positioning. I think we are underestimating trump’s push for lower interest rates and the extent he went to pressure powell in aligning to his agendas. Its unthinkable that Trump wouldn’t have covered base with Kevin Warsh on what is expected of the next fed chair. 3 - yet another technical trigger for Friday’s price action was change in margin rules by CME on silver and gold contracts. I think this was the primary reason more than any other for the violent unwinding of the leverage trade in precious metals. Precious metals may not reclaim the ATHs anytime soon but I don’t think the story is over. I think the debasement trade, multi polar world order leading to uncertain geopolitical setup( potential iran attack, trumps impulsive trade wars) are still in play and will be for quite some time which in turn will keep SLV and GLD up and center.",

      "selftext": "I can't tell you how stressful this entire experience has been. Some of you remember my Intel position - I had worked my way back from being down 95% into 39k, netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings. Once I made my original investment back, I went full regard and did some VERY aggressive futures options trades with gold/silver/oil/nasdaq. Here we are, and I'm still in disbelief when I check the account total. I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude. I'm now trading nat gas (probably too big of a position), but no aggressive trades and definitely no more 0 DTE I just want to say: if you're down big atm, there's still a chance. It isn't going to be easy (I've spent every day/night hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets) but there's a chance you can come back. None of this is worth the stress though. That post-nut clarity once you've made it back is pretty sick though. \\[the large P/L for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $4900 on Friday - as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x...believe it or not those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $4700.\\]",

Some of you remember my Intel position I had worked my way back from being down 95 % into 39k netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings . Once I made my original investment back I went full regard and did some VERY aggressive futures options trades with goldsilveroilnasdaq . Here we are and Im still in disbelief when I check the account total . I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude . Im now trading nat gas probably too big of a position but no_aggressive trades and definitely no_more 0 DTE I just want to say if youre down big atm theres still a chance . It isnt going to be easy Ive spent every daynight hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets but theres a chance you can come back . None of this is worth the stress though . That postnut clarity once youve made it back is pretty sick though . the large PL for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $ 4900 on Friday as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x ... believe it or not_those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $ 4700 ."

      "selftext": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates. Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2% at 2% inflation, President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1%, presumably around the middle of 2026 (I will explain why soon). Economics tells us, however, that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively, you need the stock market to drop, and quite hard. This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs, it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly, providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone, causing inflation to jump very quickly - potentially out of control. Of course, if you're cutting rates from the rather high 4.5% to the still high 3.75%, it isn't going to cause these issues, especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now, but the extreme 1% will not work the same. These factors, and more evidence which I will present here, leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop. Because isn't it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st (and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies), Trump announced the new Fed Chair, and the Epstein files were released (and some Iran news). Even more interesting, according to Business Insider, the Dow, on average, drops 15% after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair. February 1st was also the exact day that Trump would've pushed 10% tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise - and guess what? The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1. I don't believe it's a coincidence, but even if you do, we've had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 - hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic. Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he would've raised the tariffs by another 15%, ultimately leading me to believe June and July - after perhaps a 15-20% drop which would not surprise me - will be the bottom of this incoming bear market, and the time where rates will be cut to 1%. So, what do you think of this? Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not make it overly political. Thanks! Oh, and be careful bulls!",

      "selftext_processed": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates . Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2 % at 2 % inflation President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1 % presumably around the middle of 2026 I will explain why soon . Economics tells us however that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively you need the stock market to drop and quite hard . This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone causing inflation to jump very quickly potentially out of control . Of course if youre cutting rates from the rather high 4.5 % to the still high 3.75 % it isnt going to cause these issues especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now but the extreme 1 % will not_work the same . These factors and more evidence which I will present here leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop . Because isnt it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies Trump announced the new Fed Chair and the Epstein files were released and some Iran news . Even more interesting according to Business Insider the Dow on average drops 15 % after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair . February 1st was also the exact day that Trump wouldve pushed 10 % tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise and guess what The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1 . I dont believe its a coincidence but even if you do weve had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic . Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he wouldve raised the tariffs by another 15 % ultimately leading me to believe June and July after perhaps a 1520 % drop which would not_surprise me will be the bottom of this incoming bear market and the time where rates will be cut to 1 % . So what do you think of this Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not_make it overly political . Thanks Oh and be careful bulls"

      "selftext": "Microsoft Dominance, Pricing power, and considering the scale of company discount is meaningful. Oracle: oracle has fallen more than microsoft but considering oracles pe and that growth at oracle is capped ; microsoft has the better discount. Service now, has fallen 40 peecent this year but its not a true discount because valuation still rich with a high pe Cloudflare is always expensive. The 30% drop just makes it \"less expensive\" It’s an asymmetric play on the future ; connection, streaming in ap apps. Not much of a discount considering its previous run up, and profit? Unity : Deep discount for a growth company that has lots of options! But does not have discipline, overpaid for acquisitions, overpaid employees, at the expense of shareholders and customers. Snowflake: substantial discount ,could definitely drop more, worth buying at lower levels. Endava: Tam overestimated ,now tam underestimated. Inotiv :absolutely massive discount, from its high its 96 percent down, 96 percent off for a company that sells services to half the pharma companies. But current environment does not favor it. Adobe Has fallen over thirty percent, loved by value investors. Could fall another ten percent but a new product in the future may suprise investors. But at this point in time growth is an issue. I think figma is a stronger growth stock. Tradesk Fallen seventy percent, but still overpriced, no real discount. Toast, one year low. Expanding Tam and upsell potential, but competition means margins may be squeezed. Cover / Lightspeed Commerce / oracle could put pressure on toast. Amplitude - minus 20 this month: Amplitude is a clear winner in analytics, its analytics are used by everyone in an organization but low pricing power with too many competitors Similarweb unbelievable discount of 70 percent for an analytics company about to turn profitable,May be bought over by hyperscalers who want their analytics , but hyperscalers might deepen their own analytic capabilities especially since they have the data ,alternatively hyperscalers might buy a smaller analytics company. Reddit reached a three month low, falling by 16 percent , which isnt much considering how much the company is up. But if you really wanted to invest in reddit you can buy on dips strategy( each time it hits a three month low). Could go mich lower could go much higher so the discount isnt something you would use-to determine whether to buy Etsy ‘ minus ten percent- not really a significant drop for a midsize company already priced high. But etsy has high margins and is heavily underestimated on growth. Pinterest, year low, uncertainty, more flimsy compared to amazon tik tok meta, but growth potential is massive.Already transitioning to growth company. Root down 36 percent this year Could potentially beat traditional insurers but even if it proves its AI works a lot better, telematics is not a monopoly anymore. If every insurer adds telematics hard to see roots advantage. Rezolve, 2.60 from its height of 6. The only stock here that could tenx, Rezolve is moving from r and d gear and now going into full force sales gear . Figma, although its been around a long time still a very young company and business model will change over the next two years. This one might be worth investing once we have a clearer idea of business model and products. When they were publishing their ipo and sec it hinted there were going to move beyond credit pricing to outcome prising. Wait for proof then buy! Upwork, this is my favorite for value. Pe under ten. Ai teams , Ai matching and many users mean a strong moat.Margins are improving as well Small caps Rime, another one of my favourites , it fixes three things, empty miles, failed logistic model, and indian messy logistics. Is it priced in? Well that depends on what you think Rimes true TAM is? Do you think its all logistics, or only niche logistics. On one hand youve got many competitors, on the other hand Rime can work with competitors. Worksport down 80 percent selling a product that hasnt been sold before so no way to say this is a buy. But the science works, and they sell an incredibly useful product, truck covers that can solar charge. Arrive Ai Another logistics company (drones plus boxnow) Arrive AI is used for high value, delicate deliveries such as medicine that needs to be kept at a certain temperature but integration with legacy systems is no easy task Duolingo Massive discount, for great quality companany Ui path minus twenty percent in a month. Ui path: best in class ai integration , but very expensive especially for a smaller company upgrading to the pro plan Railvision Train safety and predictive insights into infrastructure but regulatory hurdles, and long upgrade cycles Diginex (DGNX)- massive discount 98 percent Regulatory ESG makes sure some customers will buy. But who will customers buy from currently diginex Esg is competitors have the advantage with scale, credibility, Jet Ai - massive discount 98 Percent in the last two months AI optimization improves fleet utilization, however has no real moat, no pricing power, costs are high, sensitive to customer spend. Growth buys: Pininterest, Rezolve Toast Strong buys: Microsoft Upwork Buys: Adobe , Figma ( between the two figma has more upside unlesss adobe suprises us) Buy later: Snowflake, Reddit . Endeva",

      "selftext_processed": "Microsoft Dominance Pricing power and considering the scale of company discount is meaningful . Oracle oracle has fallen more than microsoft but considering oracles pe and that growth at oracle is capped microsoft has the better discount . Service now has fallen 40 peecent this year but its not_a true discount because valuation still rich with a high pe Cloudflare is always expensive . The 30 % drop just makes it less expensive It ’ s an asymmetric play on the future connection streaming in ap apps . Not_much of a discount considering its previous run up and profit Unity Deep discount for a growth company that has lots of options But does not_have discipline overpaid for acquisitions overpaid employees at the expense of shareholders and customers . Snowflake substantial discount could definitely drop more worth buying at lower levels . Endava Tam overestimated now tam underestimated . Inotiv absolutely massive discount from its high its 96 percent down 96 percent off for a company that sells services to half the pharma companies . But current environment does not_favor it . Adobe Has fallen over thirty percent loved by value investors . Could fall another ten percent but a new product in the future may suprise investors . But at this point in time growth is an issue . I think figma is a stronger growth stock . Tradesk Fallen seventy percent but still overpriced no_real discount . Toast one year low . Expanding Tam and upsell potential but competition means margins may be squeezed . Cover Lightspeed Commerce oracle could put pressure on toast . Amplitude minus 20 this month Amplitude is a clear winner in analytics its analytics are used by everyone in an organization but low pricing power with too many competitors Similarweb unbelievable discount of 70 percent for an analytics company about to turn profitableMay be bought over by hyperscalers who want their analytics but hyperscalers might deepen their own analytic capabilities especially since they have the data alternatively hyperscalers might buy a smaller analytics company . Reddit reached a three month low falling by 16 percent which isnt much considering how much the company is up . But if you really wanted to invest in reddit you can buy on dips strategy each time it hits a three month low . Could go mich lower could go much higher so the discount isnt something you would useto determine whether to buy Etsy ‘ minus ten percent not_really a significant drop for a midsize company already priced high . But etsy has high margins and is heavily underestimated on growth . Pinterest year low uncertainty more flimsy compared to amazon tik tok meta but growth potential is massive.Already transitioning to growth company . Root down 36 percent this year Could potentially beat traditional insurers but even if it proves its AI works a lot better telematics is not_a monopoly anymore . If every insurer adds telematics hard to see roots advantage . Rezolve 2.60 from its height of 6 . The only stock here that could tenx Rezolve is moving from r and d gear and now going into full force sales gear . Figma although its been around a long time still a very young company and business model will change over the next two years . This one might be worth investing once we have a clearer idea of business model and products . When they were publishing their ipo and sec it hinted there were going to move beyond credit pricing to outcome prising . Wait for proof then buy Upwork this is my favorite for value . Pe under ten . Ai teams Ai matching and many users mean a strong moat.Margins are improving as well Small caps Rime another one of my favourites it fixes three things empty miles failed logistic model and indian messy logistics . Is it priced in Well that depends on what you think Rimes true TAM is Do you think its all logistics or only niche logistics . On one hand youve got many competitors on the other hand Rime can work with competitors . Worksport down 80 percent selling a product that hasnt been sold before so no_way to say this is a buy . But the science works and they sell an incredibly useful product truck covers that can solar charge . Arrive Ai Another logistics company drones plus boxnow Arrive AI is used for high value delicate deliveries such as medicine that needs to be kept at a certain temperature but integration with legacy systems is no_easy task Duolingo Massive discount for great quality companany Ui path minus twenty percent in a month . Ui path best in class ai integration but very expensive especially for a smaller company upgrading to the pro plan Railvision Train safety and predictive insights into infrastructure but regulatory hurdles and long upgrade cycles Diginex DGNX massive discount 98 percent Regulatory ESG makes sure some customers will buy . But who will customers buy from currently diginex Esg is competitors have the advantage with scale credibility Jet Ai massive discount 98 Percent in the last two months AI optimization improves fleet utilization however has no_real moat no_pricing power costs are high sensitive to customer spend . Growth buys Pininterest Rezolve Toast Strong buys Microsoft Upwork Buys Adobe Figma between the two figma has more upside unlesss adobe suprises us Buy later Snowflake Reddit . Endeva"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 19 and I’ve been investing into my tfsa a bit here and there since I got it up and running. About 300 a month. Here’s my question however, I’m not super knowledgeable about the stock market but I’ve always been curious about investing my money myself and crypto has also spiked my interest a few times, I have a broker who invests the 300 dollars a month for me, he’s a family friend so I know him personally and he’s been doing this for a very long time. I’ve thought about opening my own Wealth Simple tfsa so I can put some money into that every month and invest myself into stock and etf, etc myself. Is it better to just keep letting my broker do it himself or should I contribute 200 or so a month into my Wealth Simple so I can invest myself. I know that was a bit to read and getting to the question took a bit but I wanted to not leave out any info lol. Thanks everyone !",

Here ’ s my question however I ’ m not_super knowledgeable about the stock market but I ’ ve always been curious about investing my money myself and crypto has also spiked my interest a few times I have a broker who invests the 300 dollars a month for me he ’ s a family friend so I know him personally and he ’ s been doing this for a very long time . I ’ ve thought about opening my own Wealth Simple tfsa so I can put some money into that every month and invest myself into stock and etf etc myself . Is it better to just keep letting my broker do it himself or should I contribute 200 or so a month into my Wealth Simple so I can invest myself . I know that was a bit to read and getting to the question took a bit but I wanted to not_leave out any info lol . Thanks everyone"

The USD has dropped in value by like 10% and the political climate isn’t giving me comfort in the stock market as a whole. I seriously want to invest and grow my portfolio though. My worries: is a hypothetical war with the UN going to tank ETFs? Is this current administration trying to dry up the USD and transfer their wealth to BTC? If im this unsure about it, wouldn’t investing in physical currency be the best method? I am uncertain if the USD will be a fundamental currency in the next 10 years, and am even more uncertain about the stock market’s ups and downs during this unprecedented political climate. That being said, I am still casually buying into single stocks that I trust and am reluctantly still adding into my Roth.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a Nu holder and wanted to share an experience from a close friend in Brazil who recently decided to use Nu’s app to buy stocks instead of a traditional broker. Honestly, the experience sounds pretty rough. Some of the main issues he ran into: - You can only buy full shares (no fractional shares at all); - He placed a sell order during market hours, but the cash from the sale didn’t show up immediately in his account; - No live stock prices, you can’t really track price movements in real time; - Very limited information on the stocks (no depth, no proper charts, no context); - App navigation is Portuguese-only, no language flexibility; - The app feels cluttered with ads pushing credit products and services; - Buying and selling stocks doesn’t feel smooth or intuitive at all. This made me wonder: Is Nu treating stock investing as a serious long-term product, or just a secondary feature to cross-sell credit and banking services? As investors, we often focus on: user growth, engagement, ecosystem expansion. But product quality matters, especially if Nu wants to keep users inside its platform instead of losing them to real brokers. For those in Brazil actually using Nu Invest: Has this been your experience too? Has it improved recently? Do you still use it, or did you move to another platform? Curious to hear real user feedback, especially from locals.",

      "selftext": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago. I was/am very ignorant of investing. One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees. I looked through my statements and saw around $300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025. That's around $1200 a year in fees! I checked 2021-2024 and it was only a $40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief. I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year. I don't think the advisor did anything shady. They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didn't ask enough questions about it. My friend also made me aware of all the \"invisible\" fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades. So now I'm looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees. I'm considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3% match for IRA transfers and contributions, or Fidelity since that's what my 401k is in and it'd be nice to have it all in once place. I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH, not withdraw what I already have. Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages? I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake. Next. Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself, I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in. I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had high(er) expense ratios. My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped. I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds. The split would be 80% stock(US and Foreign) and 20% bonds. Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that I've done. I'm not looking to do anything fancy or game the market. I'm just going to max my contribution each year, then sit and hold for 30 years. Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above? Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA, then selling everything my advisor had me in, then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup. I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first. I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications? Any help is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago . I wasam very ignorant of investing . One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees . I looked through my statements and saw around $ 300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025 . Thats around $ 1200 a year in fees I checked 20212024 and it was only a $ 40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief . I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year . I dont think the advisor did anything shady . They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didnt ask enough questions about it . My friend also made me aware of all the invisible fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades . So now Im looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees . Im considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3 % match for IRA transfers and contributions or Fidelity since thats what my 401k is in and itd be nice to have it all in once place . I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH not_withdraw what I already have . Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake . Next . Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in . I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had higher expense ratios . My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped . I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds . The split would be 80 % stockUS and Foreign and 20 % bonds . Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that Ive done . Im not_looking to do anything fancy or game the market . Im just going to max my contribution each year then sit and hold for 30 years . Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA then selling everything my advisor had me in then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup . I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first . I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications Any help is appreciated ."

      "selftext": "I recently went down the rabbit hole around investing, stocks & crypto etc and I noticed that I feel more inclined to invest in higher risk but potentially higher rewards things even though most people advise against it This made me wonder, are people with adhd more likely to do the higher risk things because we tend to chase dopamine more? And with that also more at risk of losing a lot of money? Or is this just a me thing and can other people with adhd who invest not relate? Interested in the stories of others with adhd when it comes to investing and whether you lost a lot of money with it (or earned)",

These freestyle machines can give consumers multiple choices of drinks and the ability to mix multiple drinks. But not everyone realises this has made Coca-Cola hundreds of millions or more. This machine helps Coca-Cola know what favours people are using the most which means they know what drinks work and they can promote it. Saving on marketing costs as they know what to focus on.

I’ve tried investing a few times before, nothing serious. Small amounts, short periods. My dad was a gambling addict, so I’m very aware of that risk and I really don’t want to go down that road. Still, for some reason I’m decent at reading the market, waiting, not panicking. At least so far. In the past, the most I ever made was maybe €400 or €500. This time was different. With the market the way it is and some lucky decisions, I ended up turning that €100 into about €4,500 in a week and a half. I’m grateful, obviously. That money actually matters in my life and gives me some breathing room. But I also feel weird about it. Almost guilty. It makes my normal work feel pointless. I work my hours, I do side jobs, I try to improve my situation slowly… and then this happens, and it feels completely disconnected from effort or value. The market feels real and fake at the same time. Aggressive, almost brutal. Like you’re winning only because someone else is losing. I don’t know. I didn’t expect the money to bother me this much, but it does",

      "title": "How to filter Insider Trading data: Why buying high is actually a stronger signal than buying low",
      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer analysis, so I will try to explain my strategy at once** Okay, so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals, better data, and direct lines to management. Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However, there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours: SEC Form 4 Filings. I’ve spent the last few months (during my masters degree) refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity. I’m not talking about following politicians. I’m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it’s public. Below is the framework I use to filter this data, backed by academic research that explains *why* this works. # The Signal: The \"Cluster Buy\" A single insider buying stock can mean anything. They might be saving face, diversifying, or just optimistic. It’s noisy data. The real signal is the **Cluster Buy**. This occurs when **three or more unique insiders** purchase stock on the open market within a short window (usually <30 days). * **Why it matters:** Research by Alldredge and Blank (2019) confirms that insiders \"herd\" with their colleagues. They found an insider is nearly **four times more likely** to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently * **The Hierarchy:** Not all clusters are equal. Clusters led by **CFOs and Directors** exhibit the highest subsequent returns. The CFO knows the numbers; Directors see the strategy. When they move together, it’s a high-conviction signal. # The Filter: Ignoring the Noise 90% of insider transactions are noise. To find the alpha, you have to filter aggressively. Here are the three specific filters I use: **1. Ignore \"Routine\" Trades** We are looking for **Opportunistic Traders**. If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons, that trade contains zero information. You want to see trades that break a pattern. **2. The \"Buy High\" Anomaly** Conventional wisdom says \"buy low.\" However, research by Li, Wang, Yan, and Zhang (2019) uncovered a powerful anomaly: **Insiders who buy at 52-week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52-week lows**. * **The Logic:** This is called overcoming \"Anchoring Bias.\" Psychologically, it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30%. If an insider buys at a 52-week high, they are fighting human nature. They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher. A \"High Buy\" is a massive confidence signal. **3. The \"Not-Sold\" Signal** Sometimes the best signal is what insiders *don't* do. DeVault, Cederburg, and Wang (2021) analyzed **Portfolio Insiders** (directors who sit on multiple boards). * **The Signal:** If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B, and they sell Company A but **hold** Company B, the \"Not-Sold\" stock (Company B) significantly outperforms the market. If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock, check if those insiders are selling their *other* holdings to fund it. That doubles the conviction. # The Execution: Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one. Execution is where you make or lose money. **Rule 1: Wait for Price Confirmation** Insiders are notoriously early. They are value investors with infinite time horizons. You are not. * **My Trigger:** I wait for the stock to **reclaim the average price** of the insider's purchase. * **The Logic:** If the CFO buys at $50 and the stock drops to $40, the market disagrees with him. I stay away. When the stock rallies back through $50, it confirms the \"Insider Floor\" is holding and momentum is aligning with the insider's view. **Rule 2: Focus on Liquid Stocks** Paradoxically, insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks. Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume. A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks. **Rule 3: The \"Silent\" Exit** Retail investors usually sell too early or too late. I watch the insiders. If they stop buying during a subsequent dip, or if they start \"Routine\" selling into strength, the edge is gone. # Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash (especially at 52-week highs) it is the purest signal of value you can find. I track these **Cluster Buys** and publish a deep-dive watchlist of the most significant ones every week.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer analysis so I will try to explain my strategy at once Okay so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals better data and direct lines to management . Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours SEC Form 4 Filings . I ’ ve spent the last few months during my masters degree refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity . I ’ m not_talking about following politicians . I ’ m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it ’ s public . Below is the framework I use to filter this data backed by academic research that explains why this works . The Signal The Cluster Buy A single insider buying stock can mean anything . They might be saving face diversifying or just optimistic . It ’ s noisy data . The real signal is the Cluster Buy . This occurs when three or more unique insiders purchase stock on the open market within a short window usually 30 days . Why it matters Research by Alldredge and Blank 2019 confirms that insiders herd with their colleagues . They found an insider is nearly four times more likely to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently The Hierarchy Not_all clusters are equal . Clusters led by CFOs and Directors exhibit the highest subsequent returns . The CFO knows the numbers Directors see the strategy . When they move together it ’ s a highconviction signal . The Filter Ignoring the Noise 90 % of insider transactions are noise . To find the alpha you have to filter aggressively . Here are the three specific filters I use 1 . Ignore Routine Trades We are looking for Opportunistic Traders . If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons that trade contains zero information . You want to see trades that break a pattern . 2 . The Buy High Anomaly Conventional wisdom says buy low . However research by Li Wang Yan and Zhang 2019 uncovered a powerful anomaly Insiders who buy at 52week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52week lows . The Logic This is called overcoming Anchoring Bias . Psychologically it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30 % . If an insider buys at a 52week high they are fighting human nature . They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher . A High Buy is a massive confidence signal . 3 . The NotSold Signal Sometimes the best signal is what insiders dont do . DeVault Cederburg and Wang 2021 analyzed Portfolio Insiders directors who sit on multiple boards . The Signal If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B and they sell Company A but hold Company B the NotSold stock Company B significantly outperforms the market . If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock check if those insiders are selling their other holdings to fund it . That doubles the conviction . The Execution Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one . Execution is where you make or lose money . Rule 1 Wait for Price Confirmation Insiders are notoriously early . They are value investors with infinite time horizons . You are not_ My Trigger I wait for the stock to reclaim the average price of the insiders purchase . The Logic If the CFO buys at $ 50 and the stock drops to $ 40 the market disagrees with him . I stay away . When the stock rallies back through $ 50 it confirms the Insider Floor is holding and momentum is aligning with the insiders view . Rule 2 Focus on Liquid Stocks Paradoxically insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks . Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume . A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks . Rule 3 The Silent Exit Retail investors usually sell too early or too late . I watch the insiders . If they stop buying during a subsequent dip or if they start Routine selling into strength the edge is gone . Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash especially at 52week highs it is the purest signal of value you can find . I track these Cluster Buys and publish a deepdive watchlist of the most significant ones every week ."

      "title": "GlobalFoundries $GFS has 101.25% Institutional Ownerships with 11.66% of the float short.",
      "selftext": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th, the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips, for $20B, that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them, which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $GFS, who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics, the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq. What left me dumbfounded, is why $GFS was trading flat on the news for the week, and looking deeper into the stock, I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th, a week before Nvidia buying Groq, there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares, that barely moved the stock at all on that date, wtf… I know Quad-witching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that don't necessarily affect the stock, but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock’s volume on Quad-witching… So, putting two and two together, someone *probably* knew Nvidia was buying Groq, and they used the Quad-Witching date to load the f’king boat on GlobalFoundries. A week after the Groq acquisition, $GFS finally started climbing rapidly, from $35, to over $48 on January 27th, before pulling back to its current price of $42.20. Why the curious delayed reaction to the move? I believe, because this stock is shorted to the gills, and *someone* can’t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out. One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $GFS is currently shorted, Institutions hold 101.25% of the float, while a whopping 11.66% of that float is short, which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi’s… For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month. One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M! Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post. Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself. That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS. To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \\[OBV\\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month! $GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger……….. As always, this is not Financial Advice, don't blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet, this is all PURE speculation on my part. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** From u/Independent-Exam1863 comment below, the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with it's GR00Ts Robotics program. It all starts to make sense with $GFS acquisition of MIPS & Synopsis, who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI; with their acquisition $GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE 2\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** Well, holy shit, I should've dug deeper into this, Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis!",

      "selftext_processed": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips for $ 20B that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $ GFS who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq . What left me dumbfounded is why $ GFS was trading flat on the news for the week and looking deeper into the stock I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th a week before Nvidia buying Groq there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares that barely moved the stock at all on that date wtf… I know Quadwitching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that dont necessarily affect the stock but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock ’ s volume on Quadwitching… So putting two and two together someone probably knew Nvidia was buying Groq and they used the QuadWitching date to load the f ’ king boat on GlobalFoundries . A week after the Groq acquisition $ GFS finally started climbing rapidly from $ 35 to over $ 48 on January 27th before pulling back to its current price of $ 42.20 . Why the curious delayed reaction to the move I believe because this stock is shorted to the gills and someone can ’ t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out . One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $ GFS is currently shorted Institutions hold 101.25 % of the float while a whopping 11.66 % of that float is short which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi ’ s… For more confirmation that $ GFS is dangerously shorted on Dec 31st just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $ 35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere_downgrading the stock and dropping the stock nearly 4 % on the day instead of continuing its plunge Bulls smelled blood in the water and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $ 48 in less than a month . One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 41726 $ 45 Calls for $ 5.2M then sold it for $ 14.2M on the price surge and then doubled down with 417 $ 55 Calls for nearly $ 10M Clearly they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 211 and that brings me to my first point of this post . Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI so they spent $ 20B on Groq AI Chips and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips if you ’ re Nvidia you ’ re not_gonna spend $ 20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips so the next logical investment for $ NVDA is to buy a stake in $ GFS itself . That MUST be what that Options Whale is betting on maybe an announcement on 211 earnings and with $ GFS so heavily shorted this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $ NVDA does intend to invest in $ GFS . To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries below is the Daily OnBalance Volume OBV chart ignore all those black lines in the middle those are my Intraday trendlines the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure to nearly hitting its Dec ’ 22 ATHs before pulling back but still staying above the Gann Fan and breaking that downward trend in just a single month $ GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options I believe Longs are betting on a run soon with or without $ NVDA buying a stake in $ GFS AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in . My position is 9 July 17th $ 45 Calls wish my account were bigger……… .. As always this is not_Financial Advice dont blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet this is all PURE speculation on my part . UPDATE From uIndependentExam1863 comment below the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with its GR00Ts Robotics program . It all starts to make sense with $ GFS acquisition of MIPS Synopsis who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI with their acquisition $ GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips . UPDATE 2 Well holy shit I shouldve dug deeper into this Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis"

Musk's satellite-based internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver, accounting for about 50% to 80% of the total, the people said. >The rapid launch of 9,500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the world's largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service. The internet service, along with government contracts associated with Starlink and military-grade satellite network Starshield, has generated key revenue to help fund development of the company's next-generation Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit. >The company bought $19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the direct-to-device market, in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal. >The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world, close to Musk's 55th birthday ‍on June 28, the ⁠people said. >Musk expects Starship, which has test-launched 11 times since 2023, to start launching payloads into space this year. The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠space-based AI data centers, a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the company's proposed merger with xAI.",

SpaceXs most recent ‌financials which have not_been previously reported led some banks to estimate that the company could raise more than $ 50 billion at a valuation exceeding $ 1.5 trillion said the people who asked not_to be named to discuss private conversations . Reuters reported on Thursday that SpaceX is also in talks with ⁠Musk ’ s artificial intelligence company xAI XAAI.PVT ‌about a merger ahead of the IPO . SpaceX did not_immediately return a request for comment . The profit figure was earnings before interest taxes depreciation and ‍amortization a key measure of operating performance . Musks satellitebased internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver accounting for about 50 % to 80 % of the total the people said . The rapid launch of 9500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the worlds largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service . The internet service along with government contracts associated with Starlink and militarygrade satellite network Starshield has generated key revenue to help fund development of the companys nextgeneration Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit . The company bought $ 19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the directtodevice market in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal . The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world close to Musks 55th birthday ‍on June 28 the ⁠people said . Musk expects Starship which has testlaunched 11 times since 2023 to start launching payloads into space this year . The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠spacebased AI data centers a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the companys proposed merger with xAI ."

      "selftext": "I’m actually gonna lose it if I hear one more person just dismiss someone else’s investment thesis with “it’s already priced in.” It’s probably not. And the meme of things always being priced in comes from the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which is an academic theory adjacent to Modern Portfolio Theory, which itself has been bastardized and misappropriated by many “investors” online. So here’s a quick rundown on it from someone who actually knows what it is, what it’s used for, and why it does not mean you can’t be a successful active retail trader. EMH argues that asset prices reflect all available info. There are three forms of EMH: strong, semi-strong, weak. Weak form argues that technical analysis is useless. This is somewhat true IMO, but support/resistance, volume spikes, relative strength, and moving averages are useful. Semi-strong form argues that fundamental analysis is useless, which is just blatantly untrue. The market is often slow to react and there are God knows how many examples of people catching things early. I’ve done, you’ve done it, and institutions certainly have done it. Strong form argues that insider trading is useless and I don’t even think I need to expand on how untrue that is. Now, does that mean I’m dismissing EMH and its creator as stupid? Of course not. EMH was created by Eugene Fama, and his name speaks for itself. Among his many accomplishments, he created the Fama-French model, which has also been bastardized by “investors” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101: it’s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations, before you teach them (or they learn themselves) that real life is messy. EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines, that irrational behavior is totally random, and that if a price does get irrational, smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be. In reality, none of this is true. If this were true, we never would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022. It also assumes that there are no asymmetries in access to information, and that trading is frictionless - no costs, no tax, and instant. Bottom line: yes it’s hard to beat the market. You won’t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers. EMH explains why markets are hard to beat. But it’s a classroom model, not real life.",

So here ’ s a quick rundown on it from someone who actually knows what it is what it ’ s used for and why it does not_mean you can ’ t be a successful active retail trader . EMH argues that asset prices reflect all available info . There are three forms of EMH strong semistrong weak . Weak form argues that technical analysis is useless . This is somewhat true IMO but supportresistance volume spikes relative strength and moving averages are useful . Semistrong form argues that fundamental analysis is useless which is just blatantly untrue . The market is often slow to react and there are God knows how many examples of people catching things early . I ’ ve done you ’ ve done it and institutions certainly have done it . Strong form argues that insider trading is useless and I don ’ t even think I need to expand on how untrue that is . Now does that mean I ’ m dismissing EMH and its creator as stupid Of course not_EMH was created by Eugene Fama and his name speaks for itself . Among his many accomplishments he created the FamaFrench model which has also been bastardized by “ investors ” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101 it ’ s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations before you teach them or they learn themselves that real life is messy . EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines that irrational behavior is totally random and that if a price does get irrational smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be . In reality none of this is true . If this were true we never_would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022 . It also assumes that there are no_asymmetries in access to information and that trading is frictionless no_costs no_tax and instant . Bottom line yes it ’ s hard to beat the market . You won ’ t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers . EMH explains why markets are hard to beat . But it ’ s a classroom model not_real life ."

      "selftext": "Most of my retirement is in ETFs and such but I do have a good amount in single stocks that I actively manage. My largest position is a stock that is currently trading at around $136/share. I own about 150 shares with a cost basis of around $120. As of today It’s down over the last year (-3%) but has trading as high as \\~$150 just a month or so ago. It’s biopharma so volatility is pretty common. I’m still very bullish on the stock as I’m familiar with their products, pipeline, and upcoming catalysts (I work in the industry). That said, I’m wondering if it makes sense to replace 100 of those shares with a LEAP (furthest out right now is December). I’m thinking deep ITM like $80 (breakeven at the current ask would be +3%). Note that these are long positions for me so they do have long term capital gains tax status should I sell.",

As of today It ’ s down over the last year 3 % but has trading as high as $ 150 just a month or so ago . It ’ s biopharma so volatility is pretty common . I ’ m still very bullish on the stock as I ’ m familiar with their products pipeline and upcoming catalysts I work in the industry . That said I ’ m wondering if it makes sense to replace 100 of those shares with a LEAP furthest out right now is December . I ’ m thinking deep ITM like $ 80 breakeven at the current ask would be 3 % . Note that these are long positions for me so they do have long term capital gains tax status should I sell ."

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, staying fully invested is often treated as the default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over long horizons, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally maintain a degree of flexibility through modest allocations to cash or short-duration assets. This can allow rebalancing, deployment during drawdowns, or reduced forced selling during periods of market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it may also affect risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is structured and used. From a portfolio construction standpoint, how do you think about this tradeoff? Do you view flexibility as a form of risk management, or as an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? How do you approach this in practice over full market cycles.?",

      "selftext": "The entire financial industry is built on the idea that government bonds are risk free. It is the foundation of the 60/40 portfolio and the standard advice for anyone seeking safety. I checked several academic research papers and the historical data paints a very different picture **1. The inflation tax** Simply, nominal returns are guaranteed but real returns are not. Research from Robeco on the Bond Winter shows that during inflationary spikes like the 1970s and 2020s, bond investors suffered real drawdowns between 30% and 50%. That is a crash, not capital preservation. **2. Duration volatility** Similar to stocks, when interset rates rise, prices fall. The Manhattan Institute notes that long duration bonds can experience volatility that rivals equities. If you bought long duration treasuries in 2020 for safety, you saw your principal collapse in 2022 **3. The soft default** We assume sovereigns always pay. Data from the Bank of England shows that 75% of sovereigns have defaulted since 1960. Developed nations do not default by refusing to pay. They default by printing money and diluting the currency you are holding. So if risk free rate is not risk free, why do we need it? So we can at least benchmark our returns to something?",

It is the foundation of the 6040 portfolio and the standard advice for anyone seeking safety . I checked several academic research papers and the historical data paints a very different picture 1 . The inflation tax Simply nominal returns are guaranteed but real returns are not_Research from Robeco on the Bond Winter shows that during inflationary spikes like the 1970s and 2020s bond investors suffered real drawdowns between 30 % and 50 % . That is a crash not_capital preservation . 2 . Duration volatility Similar to stocks when interset rates rise prices fall . The Manhattan Institute notes that long duration bonds can experience volatility that rivals equities . If you bought long duration treasuries in 2020 for safety you saw your principal collapse in 2022 3 . The soft default We assume sovereigns always pay . Data from the Bank of England shows that 75 % of sovereigns have defaulted since 1960 . Developed nations do not_default by refusing to pay . They default by printing money and diluting the currency you are holding . So if risk free rate is not_risk free why do we need it So we can at least benchmark our returns to something"

      "selftext": "What’s everyone’s take on Monday’s market after Friday’s selloff? The silver crash especially stood out to me. It felt less like fundamentals breaking and more like forced selling and leverage getting unwound. CME margin increase mandate was the main reason. So, big guys messed up and now this shutdown again. Because of that, I’m leaning toward more correction and chop, similar to what we saw around the November shutdown. I’m not rushing to buy the first bounce. If anything, I’ll be watching for another flush and looking at quality names or assets that were sold for liquidity rather than because something actually broke. Curious if others are expecting continuation lower or stabilization next week. What’s the Best Buys/targets right now. I also am in NBIS with lot of margin. So, will you say hold or sell. My average is 1000@112. This play is troubling me a lot. It’s having very weak price action right now.",

Gold margins will increase to 8 % of value of underlying contract from the present 6 % for nonheightened risk profile the exchange said on Friday . It added that the heightened risk profile margins would rise to 8.8 % from the present 6.6 . Silver margins will increase to 15 % from the present 11 % for the nonheightened risk profile . Meanwhile the heightened risk profile margins will witness a hike to 16.5 % from the present 12.1 % as per the statement . Platinum and palladium futures ’ margin also will be boosted . The change takes effect from Monday ’ s close and follows a “ normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage ” it said . The increase means those who want to trade futures of gold silver platinum and palladium will need to put up more collateral to ensure they can meet their obligations . While the exchange routinely raises margins when a contract is soaring sliding or extremely volatile Friday ’ s move could further edge out smaller players who don ’ t have enough cash to make the necessary deposits . Earlier this week the exchange hiked margins for silver platinum and palladium futures following price surges ."

The question is: Is the market ready for it? And is this a strategic move planned for sometime, or a pivot necessitated by plummeting Tesla EV sales? \\- Total automotive revenues dropped -11% YoY \\- 25Q4 Vehicle deliveries down -16% Yet somehow, despite plummeting auto sales, and pivot to an unproven market - that is not forecasting sales until 2027 - the stock continues to climb.

The question is Is the market ready for it And is this a strategic move planned for sometime or a pivot necessitated by plummeting Tesla EV sales Total automotive revenues dropped 11 % YoY 25Q4 Vehicle deliveries down 16 % Yet somehow despite plummeting auto sales and pivot to an unproven market that is not_forecasting sales until 2027 the stock continues to climb .

      "selftext": "*I've been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff, safe haven dumps, and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding.* *Needless to say, it's been fascinating, and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean, and organising a structural engineer for my house on the \"next week\" backburner.* So what's new? **Key points:** \\- Fed Chairman Warsh appointment: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday. He is a known hawk; his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort, tending toward short-term interest rate drops while maintaining long-term raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric. \\- Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday, January 28, stating the U.S. is not planning to intervene, indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis. \\- The Yen reached a critical low point this week, testing the 158-159 range (closing Friday at 154.73). Any further drops become an un-ignorable domestic cost of living issue, and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160. \\- Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5% (down from 2.0%), virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate intervention, as rates remain pinned at 0.75%. \\- US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0% line (the 30-year ended Friday at 4.87%), a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse. \\- Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent; the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday, February 2, with auctions to follow. **The crossroads?** The carry trade needs to unwind, as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward, whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward. However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse. **Avenues?** A. The Fed could print USD to buy Yen, however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood, with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese. B. The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen, however recent economic figures (1.5% CPI) rule this out as a short-term possibility, and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind. C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency, via deploying USD cash reserves of \\~$160.4 Billion (held as deposits at the Fed), or selling T-bills/notes/bonds from their $1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen. As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now, leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages. A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries. Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets, spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance. This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings, crypto typically first, high risk stocks, and then precious metals (as seen in Friday's sharp gold sell-off). As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic, even for gold and silver, is seldom a good bet. Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail, as cash (USD/EUR/YEN) currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle. I suspect metals will find a floor, however commodities are not my turf so I'll let others do the deeper commentary there. **The remaining option?** There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover. The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF, strengthening the Yen, triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short positions, and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned, whilst also not crushing the carry trade. Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed, the carry trade is not crushed and can slowly unwind, and global stock markets grind on higher. However what happens next remains to be seen, and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls. \\--- Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff safe haven dumps and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding . Needless to say its been fascinating and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean and organising a structural engineer for my house on the next week backburner . So whats new Key points Fed Chairman Warsh appointment President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday . He is a known hawk his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort tending toward shortterm interest rate drops while maintaining longterm raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric . Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday January 28 stating the U.S. is not_planning to intervene indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis . The Yen reached a critical low point this week testing the 158159 range closing Friday at 154.73 . Any further drops become an unignorable domestic cost of living issue and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160 . Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5 % down from 2.0 % virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan BoJ rate intervention as rates remain pinned at 0.75 % . US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0 % line the 30year ended Friday at 4.87 % a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse . Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday February 2 with auctions to follow . The crossroads The carry trade needs to unwind as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward . However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse . Avenues A . The Fed could print USD to buy Yen however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese . B . The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen however recent economic figures 1.5 % CPI rule this out as a shortterm possibility and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind . C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency via deploying USD cash reserves of $ 160.4 Billion held as deposits at the Fed or selling Tbillsnotesbonds from their $ 1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen . As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages . A Tbill shortterm Tnote and bond long term sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows and send US Bond yields soaring sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse particular in longer term treasuries . Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance . This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings crypto typically first high risk stocks and then precious metals as seen in Fridays sharp gold selloff . As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic even for gold and silver is seldom a good bet . Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail as cash USDEURYEN currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle . I suspect metals will find a floor however commodities are not_my turf so Ill let others do the deeper commentary there . The remaining option There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover . The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF strengthening the Yen triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short positions and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned whilst also not_crushing the carry trade . Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed the carry trade is not_crushed and can slowly unwind and global stock markets grind on higher . However what happens next remains to be seen and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls . Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀"

      "selftext": "**TL,DR/Summary:** Today, the silver price dropped \\~30%, an event unseen in about 15 years. This may not be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9% and/or Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair. A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in today's sell-off. I gathered a timeline of recent events before today's historic crash in silver price. I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the US-dollar index gaining 0.9% is at least incomplete (and at most a smokescreen). **Timeline** * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group switches from a fixed-dollar margin per contract to a 9% percentage margin ([PDF source]( Hence, traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group announces new 100-ounce **cash-settled** futures * 27 Jan 2026: CME group increases the margin requirement from 9% to 11% ([PDF source]( forcing more traders to liquidate * 28 Jan 2026: ex-JPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50% drop in silver price ([source]( JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF * 29 Jan 2026: Still, silver hits an all time high at around $121 * 30 Jan 2026: Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair, and the USD index gains 0.9%. This is the narrative for silver plummeting \\~30% in one day. However, historically, hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere near a comparable sell-off **The COMEX Physical Silver Problem** CME group, as of 30 Jan 2026, reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces ([Silver Stocks Excel file]( The March silver future open interest, however, is roughly 490m ounces (source: [open interest 98k](#tradeDate=20260129), where each contract is for 5k ounces). Hence, it will be disastrous for COMEX if \\~22% of March future holders demand physical delivery. They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions. Likewise, bullion banks that sold these future contracts (and are short silver), would be able to maintain their short positions, avoid catastrophic losses, and gain massively. I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash. What's your take on this, and what does it mean for the silver price? Cheers -",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDRSummary Today the silver price dropped 30 % an event unseen in about 15 years . This may not_be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9 % andor Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair . A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in todays selloff . I gathered a timeline of recent events before todays historic crash in silver price . I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the USdollar index gaining 0.9 % is at least incomplete and at most a smokescreen . Timeline 13 Jan 2026 CME Group switches from a fixeddollar margin per contract to a 9 % percentage margin PDF source Hence traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price 13 Jan 2026 CME Group announces new 100ounce cashsettled futures 27 Jan 2026 CME group increases the margin requirement from 9 % to 11 % PDF source forcing more traders to liquidate 28 Jan 2026 exJPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50 % drop in silver price source JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF 29 Jan 2026 Still silver hits an all time high at around $ 121 30 Jan 2026 Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair and the USD index gains 0.9 % . This is the narrative for silver plummeting 30 % in one day . However historically hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere_near a comparable selloff The COMEX Physical Silver Problem CME group as of 30 Jan 2026 reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces Silver Stocks Excel file The March silver future open interest however is roughly 490m ounces source open interest 98ktrade Date20260129 where each contract is for 5k ounces . Hence it will be disastrous for COMEX if 22 % of March future holders demand physical delivery . They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions . Likewise bullion banks that sold these future contracts and are short silver would be able to maintain their short positions avoid catastrophic losses and gain massively . I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash . Whats your take on this and what does it mean for the silver price Cheers"

I've done moderately well this past year, mostly just the market doing what it's doing, but I've made a few good choices and some other \"learning experiences\" I'm wondering, how can I improve my strategy for stop losses while capitalizing on the greatest amount of gain possible? I don't have the time or commitment to watch my holdings every minute. I want to have a better system of when I enter a position, setting up appropriate stops and also conditional trades so that I can take advantage of upswings but don't get burnt by sell offs. Is it advisable strategy to set up conditional trades such as this: if you enter at $100 for example, set up a cobditional trade such that if the stock dips past - 3% below it's 30-day high, it triggers a market sale. Something like that? Or what conditional trades do you use when you enter a position?",

      "selftext": "I track my percentage return from dividends as a percentage. Stock prices changes and so, the percentage changes. I track the earnings percentage in two columns; one for my purchase price and one for the rate at the current day's price. Weirdly, I view my dividend annual interest rate differently, depending on whether the stock price is up or down. For example, I bought CVX at $136 last June when the rate was 5%. At today's price ($176.90), the rate is 3.87%. I still \"think\" that my \"original\" money is earning 5%. On the other hand, I bought RA at $21.18, now at $13.02 but I \"think\" that my earnings rate is 6.69%, even though someone buying today would be earning 10.88% per year. My original RA investment, much of it lost, is earning at the lower rate. Should I be thinking of things differently? It doesn't seem to make much sense to use both the \"my cost\" rate and the \"current price rate, depending on whether I \"won\" or \"lost\" on the original purchase price.",

One of my research strategy is the management quality. I lost faith in Elon and his cult following group years ago but was too afraid to pull the trigger with seeing my account up \\~170% on my position and the FOMO of Robotics and Robotaxis. Truth is I can no longer go to sleep trusting my money in a CEO that is unreliable, committed securities fraud in the past and trying to plug in his other companies under the Tesla hood. Not to mention the financials. The market does not make sense anymore but I can. I might regrett it but Tesla is no longer the company it used to be and I can no longer overlook the finanical red flags.... EDIT 1: Many Elon boys think I sold out of spite for their leader. I don’t give a fuck about him. To attribute the output of an entire workforce to one figurehead is disrespectful to the engineers. I just literally ran models, looked at earnings reports, data, demand curves for Tesla, nothing supports my original thesis. I beg you before fighting me in the comments and riding Elon’s D, show me any financial metrics that prove your point. EDIT: THANKS FOR THE AWARDS",

      "selftext_processed": "I invested in the stock in 2023 in the lows of 180s when the market sentiment was negative and the last time valuation made any coherent sense and their financials were yet solid . One of my research strategy is the management quality . I lost faith in Elon and his cult following group years ago but was too afraid to pull the trigger with seeing my account up 170 % on my position and the FOMO of Robotics and Robotaxis . Truth is I can no_longer go to sleep trusting my money in a CEO that is unreliable committed securities fraud in the past and trying to plug in his other companies under the Tesla hood . Not_to mention the financials . The market does not_make sense anymore but I can . I might regrett it but Tesla is no_longer the company it used to be and I can no_longer overlook the finanical red flags .... EDIT 1 Many Elon boys think I sold out of spite for their leader . I don ’ t give a fuck about him . To attribute the output of an entire workforce to one figurehead is disrespectful to the engineers . I just literally ran models looked at earnings reports data demand curves for Tesla nothing_supports my original thesis . I beg you before fighting me in the comments and riding Elon ’ s D show me any financial metrics that prove your point . EDIT THANKS FOR THE AWARDS"

      "selftext": "Briefings from Goldman Sachs: Gold has capped off a huge 2025 rally with a blazing start to 2026. While prices declined in early trading on Friday, Anshul Sehgal, global co-head of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, says the precious metal could continue to rise. The main driver of the move has been global central banks’ shift from the US dollar to precious metals, Sehgal says. “These are tiny markets compared to global stocks or fixed income, so the smallest change in demand makes prices go parabolic. Sehgal that only about 5% of the world’s gold is currently held by speculators. “If a central bank decides they want to pivot away from the dollar and own more gold, that is going to move the price quite violently. Which is what we're observing.” For this reason, Sehgal is skeptical of arguments that gold is currently being driven by speculative mania. “We think this is a multi-decade trajectory,\" he says. He adds that gold “barely moved” from 2010 to 2020 even as growth-oriented stocks surged, which means the recent move can partially be categorized as a catch-up. “Do we expect gold to continue to appreciate exponentially as it has? No. But we’re not fussed about there being a lot of froth when it comes to precious metals,” he says.",

Possible catalysts: \\- new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar \\- iran war de-escalation \\- unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation: the price is the consensus reached by many different players, most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading.

TL;DR: US specular’s job is to predict the asian metal market driven by fundamentals, so large moves during nyse trading hours are a false signal, serious price discovery is going to happen with American markets closed.

Possible catalysts new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar iran war deescalation unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation the price is the consensus reached by many different players most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading . They either panic sold or got margin called deepening the crash . In the Asian market however there are institutions and governments who have a strategic or long term reason to buy especially when they get a discount . They will be voting and primary driver of the monday opening price since time zone is ahead for asia . So I am expecting a gap up and I bought both GLD and SLV calls right before close on Friday .

      "selftext": "Been digging into Microsoft's financials beyond the usual revenue and EPS numbers, and wanted to share some observations that caught my attention from a value perspective. I used \\[thefinbase\\]( to pull together this data for my risk analysis before I buy this stock and \\[tradingview\\]( for financial information it has the best UI . No affiliation with these two just revealing my sources. Now let’s get going: Balance Sheet Shifting Toward Less Flexible Assets Property, plant, and equipment increased nearly 50% in a single year (from \\\\\\~$155B to \\\\\\~$230B). That's a massive tilt toward long duration, non liquid assets. Meanwhile, depreciation jumped from $22B to $34B. In a sector where hardware can become obsolete quickly, this concentration in physical infrastructure creates impairment exposure if tech refresh cycles accelerate. Some Interesting Liability Movement \"Other Current Liabilities\" increased 45% year over year. Without detailed disclosure, this likely includes unearned cloud billings and similar obligations. Worth monitoring because rapid buildup in prepayment dependency can distort cash flow timing if customer behavior shifts. The Segment Concentration Factor Intelligent Cloud now drives roughly 40% of revenue with 29% growth, while More Personal Computing actually declined 3%. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean any cloud cyclicality hits the overall business harder than it would have five years ago. The Sentiment Disconnect Despite record profits, shares declined after strong Q2 results. When markets sell the news on beat and raise quarters, it often signals expectations have gotten ahead of near term reality. None of this means the investment thesis is broken. Microsoft remains a dominant business. But as value investors, we're supposed to see what others miss and understand what we're actually paying for at current multiples. Even with these risks I still think it's a good stock to buy, especially in its role as the AI boom continues. What do you think ?",

      "selftext": "I am an ignorant anonymous, I surely know less than you, but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today. **What happened today?** Everything went to shit: gold, silver, major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit. **What does this mean?** The market received a necessary correction. After gold and silver rose savagely these days, a lot of last-minute leveraged money was absorbed. I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop: 1. **Options Expiration:** Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed. With gold at **5,500 USD**, profit-taking was factual. Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits, and thus generated downward pressure. 2. **Trump's move with Kevin Warsh:** Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed. On paper, he is a \"HAWK\" (strong dollar, high rates, and low inflation). That's why the market ran to bonds and punished stocks/gold for fear of liquidity being cut. **My opinion:** Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not long ago. For me, Warsh is a puppet: they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House. Under this thesis, when he comes to power in May, Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending. The dollar will continue to lose value, gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks, and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate (congratulations if you held emerging market bonds). But if you don't believe me even in the worst-case scenario, boys: the decay of Fiat is not fixed with a change of names. Hold your equities and don't let yourselves be scared.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am an ignorant anonymous I surely know less than you but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today . What happened today Everything went to shit gold silver major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit . What does this mean The market received a necessary correction . After gold and silver rose savagely these days a lot of lastminute leveraged money was absorbed . I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop 1 . Options Expiration Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed . With gold at 5500 USD profittaking was factual . Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits and thus generated downward pressure . 2 . Trumps move with Kevin Warsh Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed . On paper he is a HAWK strong dollar high rates and low inflation . Thats why the market ran to bonds and punished stocksgold for fear of liquidity being cut . My opinion Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not_long ago . For me Warsh is a puppet they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no_longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House . Under this thesis when he comes to power in May Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending . The dollar will continue to lose value gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate congratulations if you held emerging market bonds . But if you dont believe me even in the worstcase scenario boys the decay of Fiat is not_fixed with a change of names . Hold your equities and dont let yourselves be scared ."

Wallstreet tends to hate uncertainty so people were hedging their positions with hard assets, precious metals, while the decision on Fed chair was still being made. Now that it is here, we see a historic single day drop in hard assets. Could this be the markets shifting away from metals to be put back into equities now that a new chair has been named? I think Wallstreet is bullish on Warsh and still bullish on tech despite some uncertainties (now one less).",

Wallstreet tends to hate uncertainty so people were hedging their positions with hard assets precious metals while the decision on Fed chair was still being made . Now that it is here we see a historic single day drop in hard assets . Could this be the markets shifting away from metals to be put back into equities now that a new chair has been named I think Wallstreet is bullish on Warsh and still bullish on tech despite some uncertainties now one less ."

Here's my question: Should I do some research to find out when he acquired the stocks for which I have no date of acquisition? If so, how would I do that?

      "selftext": "Reddit (RDDT) stock has been pretty volatile lately after pulling back from a recent high, supposedly driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. There’s still a lot of bullish sentiment, with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $320 based on strong user growth and AI integration. *“… driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition.”* Competition from what exactly? TikTok? The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons? Or Snap? The app that’s been effectively dead for years? I’ll leave Meta out of this because I don’t think it even needs addressing. The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms. Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would’ve made more sense for a bullish case. Not sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things. Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher, showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair, Warsh. (Who knows, I’m not taking a stance there.) The point is, there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026, so how does that square with fears (atop of the previous points) of declining ad growth? Between Reddit ads, its growing presence in search results, AI integration, and highly targeted user interests, Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI. There’s also the new verified profile feature, which could end up being meaningful long-term, even for marketing purposes. All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me. There’s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which, honestly, should be another sign. Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5, 2026. I’ve recently been questioning that specific analyst, why there was such a reaction from it, but perhaps I had missed something on my end. **P.S.** To everyone about to yell “it’s nothing but bots!” Yeah, there are bots everywhere among all platforms. However, you’d be surprised how many users *aren’t* bots. This gives me the same energy as people saying “that must be AI!” when it clearly isn’t. Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now. I’ve watched people Google something, scroll straight past everything else, click the Reddit result to get their answer. They would also casually notice an ad while they’re there. That feels - important. **Edit:** I originally wrote this on the fly, but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point. I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below, which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one! **Edit:** There are many great points below. I agree with some of the concerns drawn, but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent, and very suddenly, selloff. **Edit:** I Love all the banbets below! Yep. I’m in for *banbet RDDT 195 1w.* I guess I’m riding with you, u/Sweg_OG",

      "selftext_processed": "Reddit RDDT stock has been pretty volatile lately after pulling back from a recent high supposedly driven by an analyst ’ s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition . There ’ s still a lot of bullish sentiment with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $ 320 based on strong user growth and AI integration . “ … driven by an analyst ’ s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. ” Competition from what exactly TikTok The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons Or Snap The app that ’ s been effectively dead for years I ’ ll leave Meta out of this because I don ’ t think it even needs addressing . The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms . Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would ’ ve made more sense for a bullish case . Not_sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things . Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair Warsh . Who knows I ’ m not_taking a stance there . The point is there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026 so how does that square with fears atop of the previous points of declining ad growth Between Reddit ads its growing presence in search results AI integration and highly targeted user interests Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI . There ’ s also the new verified profile feature which could end up being meaningful longterm even for marketing purposes . All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me . There ’ s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which honestly should be another sign . Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5 2026 . I ’ ve recently been questioning that specific analyst why there was such a reaction from it but perhaps I had missed something on my end . P.S . To everyone about to yell “ it ’ s nothing_but bots ” Yeah there are bots everywhere among all platforms . However you ’ d be surprised how many users aren ’ t bots . This gives me the same energy as people saying “ that must be AI ” when it clearly isn ’ t . Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now . I ’ ve watched people Google something scroll straight past everything else click the Reddit result to get their answer . They would also casually notice an ad while they ’ re there . That feels important . Edit I originally wrote this on the fly but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point . I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one Edit There are many great points below . I agree with some of the concerns drawn but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent and very suddenly selloff . Edit I Love all the banbets below Yep . I ’ m in for banbet RDDT 195 1w . I guess I ’ m riding with you uSweg_OG"

      "selftext": "I am from India and want to invest globally via IBKR. I am looking for non-US domiciled accumulating UCITs only for easier tax purposes. I researched and made this PF for me: 70% ACWX - Developed Markets ex usa + Emerging markets 30% CSPX - Similar to S&P500. With this my idea is to reduce US concentration in my PF because World ETFs include >60% US. But the issue is ACWX is Nasdaq based ETF. Is anyone aware of any other alternative UCITs for ACWX ?? I know I can replicate ACWX via/from EXUS + EIMI but that would require a little more monitoring down the line. ACWX would have served the purpose just right but the only issue is that it is US domiciled. TLDR; I have 2 questions: 1) Is there any ACWX alternative, non US domiciled UCIT on IBKR? 2) How do I buy gold on ibkr? best etf?",

I researched and made this PF for me 70 % ACWX Developed Markets ex usa Emerging markets 30 % CSPX Similar to SP500 . With this my idea is to reduce US concentration in my PF because World ETFs include 60 % US . But the issue is ACWX is Nasdaq based ETF . Is anyone aware of any other alternative UCITs for ACWX I know I can replicate ACWX viafrom EXUS EIMI but that would require a little more monitoring down the line . ACWX would have served the purpose just right but the only issue is that it is US domiciled . TLDR I have 2 questions 1 Is there any ACWX alternative non US domiciled UCIT on IBKR 2 How do I buy gold on ibkr best etf"

      "title": "Trust investment claims outperformance vs indexes, looking for advice",
      "selftext": "I’m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I’m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense. Background: I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next \\~3 years. The trust is administered by a large, reputable law firm, and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates. From everything I can tell, this is a legitimate, professional setup and not anything sketchy. The trust uses an outside active equity manager. The proposed long-term allocation is roughly 80% equities and 20% cash (short-term needs), with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into \\~30–40 individual stocks. The stated goal is long-term investing with a “defensive” tilt: high-quality companies, low debt, strong balance sheets, some international exposure, and selective themes (e.g., infrastructure, electrification). The annual fee is \\~1.2% of the entire trust value (not just the invested portion). This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight. Trading costs are small, but the 1.2% applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash. I asked for historical performance, and I was shown a model trust portfolio (not my specific account) covering roughly 1998–2025. According to that report: • Total portfolio (stocks + bonds + cash): \\~8.3% annualized • Equity portion alone: \\~11.6% annualized Over the same period: • S&P 500: \\~9.4% • MSCI World: \\~8.3% The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes, while also being more defensive. However, once I factor in the 1.2% annual fee on the full trust, the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly \\~7.1%. That puts it roughly in line with (or slightly below) a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio, and clearly below the S&P 500 over the same horizon. Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach: • Index funds are “not necessarily low risk” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks. • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration. • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure. • The strategy has historically “participated less” during market declines. My concerns: • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing long-term risk. • The performance shown is from a model portfolio, which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias. • The equity outperformance looks good gross, but once the full trust fee is applied, it largely disappears. • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk, it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result. • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years, I’m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the long-term portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases. I’m not claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here. The trustee is experienced, properly credentialed, and works at a well-known firm. My question is more about the math and the assumptions. For those with experience in investing, finance, or trusts: • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test? • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this? • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns? • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for? Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I ’ m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense . Background I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next 3 years . The trust is administered by a large reputable law firm and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates . From everything I can tell this is a legitimate professional setup and not_anything sketchy . The trust uses an outside active equity manager . The proposed longterm allocation is roughly 80 % equities and 20 % cash shortterm needs with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into 30–40 individual stocks . The stated goal is longterm investing with a “ defensive ” tilt highquality companies low debt strong balance sheets some international exposure and selective themes e.g . infrastructure electrification . The annual fee is 1.2 % of the entire trust value not just the invested portion . This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight . Trading costs are small but the 1.2 % applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash . I asked for historical performance and I was shown a model trust portfolio not my specific account covering roughly 1998–2025 . According to that report • Total portfolio stocks bonds cash 8.3 % annualized • Equity portion alone 11.6 % annualized Over the same period • SP 500 9.4 % • MSCI World 8.3 % The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes while also being more defensive . However once I factor in the 1.2 % annual fee on the full trust the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly 7.1 % . That puts it roughly in line with or slightly below a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio and clearly below the SP 500 over the same horizon . Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach • Index funds are “ not necessarily low risk ” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks . • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration . • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure . • The strategy has historically “ participated less ” during market declines . My concerns • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing longterm risk . • The performance shown is from a model portfolio which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias . • The equity outperformance looks good gross but once the full trust fee is applied it largely disappears . • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result . • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years I ’ m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the longterm portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases . I ’ m not_claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here . The trustee is experienced properly credentialed and works at a wellknown firm . My question is more about the math and the assumptions . For those with experience in investing finance or trusts • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives ."

      "title": "Dollar Crashing. My Criticism of Public Perception",
      "selftext": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this: The dollar has always been crashing, but it really depends on what frame of view by which you're looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you. That's where we can have a debate. As you know, we've seen headlines about the dollar collapse, and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends. But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider: What makes this 'crash' any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced? Here's what you'll see folks point to: \\- Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency. \\-Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights. \\-Recent inflation has been exceptional, where aggregate prices are 26% higher today than in 2019-2020. \\-The DXY, a measure of our currency relative to a basket of first-world nations, has come down considerably \\-Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control This is what I'd like to point to: Nothing changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new. let's look at the above talking points one-by-one. **1) Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency & 2) The DXY has come down considerably** In recent history, it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade. Is this new? No. The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline. We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar, as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was *artificially* being stymied. Just like the OPEC-mandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s, we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar. Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage. You may argue \"But did our money supply not increase??\". The answer is yes. It did. But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world. Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty. Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not seen in decades. It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized. The advent of Trump's tariffs, like him or not, did add some fuel to the fire. Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here. China being a large proponent to this. Overall, you'll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runner-up. **Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights** The price increases of Gold/Silver have been often misread as \"this must mean the value of the dollar is falling\", when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is self-fulfilling. If people believe the sky is falling, they'll buy bunkers. It's not that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling. I've already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver, so I'll not stay too long on this one, but I want to point out that in the coming months, you may see the price stagnate then climb higher. You may also see it come crashing back down. Both events are equally likely. Fundamentally, however, I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not led by central banking or any monetary authority. We can check money flows. When we do this, we find that A) there's already been an industrial shortage for silver and B) This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own. If you use fund inflows to exchange-traded products backed by gold and silver, you see they've gone up by 20-30 fold. That's not nothing. That's behavioral and not fundamental. But let's go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things: 1) **current and expected CPI** 2) **Long term treasury yields** \\-The CPI expectation hovers at 2.7-3.2%. This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 50-60 years. As for Long term treasury yield, we use this figure because I don't want to open myself up to someone saying \"Well, the fed has been buying treasuries, so that decreases yields\". They would be right, but 10 and 30-yr terms are the exception. Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates. If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally, we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30-yr terms, pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations. We'd also see a really difficult auction. We haven't seen either. Right now, yields are 160 Bps below the 60-year average, and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong; evidenced by the 'bid-to-cover' ratio, which is actually within a normal range at **2.55**. **Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control** THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely. Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending. As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases, it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand. I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change. However, some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable Debt/GDP ratio. This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically under-paces the rate in which we accumulate public debt. Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the \"Dollar Crash\" concern: QE (Quantitative Easing). QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits. This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks. **So where are we really?** It's complicated. And the news doesn't help. The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s. I'll not lie to you and say everything is okay, but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not going away. We have a real problem with debt. It's growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt, each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nation's treasury. But here's the detail we can't miss: Our economy is capitalistic, not communistic. In a capitalist country, the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace. And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money, that skews inflation recognition. Not for capital assets but for consumables. We've seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras. 1) the easy-money policy when debt was near 0%. 2) During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the top-end of the economy. Hence the K-shaped recovery. This created asset inflation, and we can call it asset inflation because of how P/E ratios, (adjusted for earnings growth), have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages. Some of this is structural. Companies, today, are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history. That can pull-forward tomorrow's pricing to today. But that's an incomplete story. If we look at capital assets, they've outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply. That's where the **dollar's value 'plunging'** shows up. This leads me back to my overall argument. The dollar crisis shows up depending on where you're looking. Capping it all off, I'll leave you with this scenario: Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim. And let's say I print off $10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself (I would). By every measure, M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50%, but does this mean the dollar's purchasing power has been cut by 1/3? No. It's the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollar's loss of purchasing power. If I started to then spend that $10 Trillion, buy all the food from the shelves, feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price I'm paying, then you'd see inflation. **The rule:** In a true currency crisis, you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transaction-related friction. For many countries, companies and individuals, that currency is still the US Dollar. When you have dollars, convert your savings into productive assets. Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery. No other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does.",

      "selftext_processed": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this The dollar has always been crashing but it really depends on what frame of view by which youre looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you . Thats where we can have a debate . As you know weve seen headlines about the dollar collapse and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends . But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider What makes this crash any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced Heres what youll see folks point to Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights . Recent inflation has been exceptional where aggregate prices are 26 % higher today than in 20192020 . The DXY a measure of our currency relative to a basket of firstworld nations has come down considerably Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control This is what Id like to point to Nothing_changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new . lets look at the above talking points onebyone . 1 Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency 2 The DXY has come down considerably In recent history it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade . Is this new No_The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline . We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was artificially being stymied . Just like the OPECmandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar . Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage . You may argue But did our money supply not_increase . The answer is yes . It did . But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world . Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty . Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not_seen in decades . It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized . The advent of Trumps tariffs like him or not_did add some fuel to the fire . Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here . China being a large proponent to this . Overall youll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runnerup . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights The price increases of GoldSilver have been often misread as this must mean the value of the dollar is falling when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is selffulfilling . If people believe the sky is falling theyll buy bunkers . Its not_that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling . Ive already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver so Ill not_stay too long on this one but I want to point out that in the coming months you may see the price stagnate then climb higher . You may also see it come crashing back down . Both events are equally likely . Fundamentally however I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not_led by central banking or any monetary authority . We can check money flows . When we do this we find that A theres already been an industrial shortage for silver and B This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own . If you use fund inflows to exchangetraded products backed by gold and silver you see theyve gone up by 2030 fold . Thats not_nothing . Thats behavioral and not_fundamental . But lets go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things 1 current and expected CPI 2 Long term treasury yields The CPI expectation hovers at 2.73.2 % . This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 5060 years . As for Long term treasury yield we use this figure because I dont want to open myself up to someone saying Well the fed has been buying treasuries so that decreases yields . They would be right but 10 and 30yr terms are the exception . Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates . If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30yr terms pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations . Wed also see a really difficult auction . We havent seen either . Right now yields are 160 Bps below the 60year average and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong evidenced by the bidtocover ratio which is actually within a normal range at 2.55 . Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely . Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending . As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand . I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change . However some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable DebtGDP ratio . This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically underpaces the rate in which we accumulate public debt . Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the Dollar Crash concern QE Quantitative Easing . QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits . This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks . So where are we really Its complicated . And the news doesnt help . The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s . Ill not_lie to you and say everything is okay but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not_going away . We have a real problem with debt . Its growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nations treasury . But heres the detail we cant miss Our economy is capitalistic not_communistic . In a capitalist country the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace . And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money that skews inflation recognition . Not_for capital assets but for consumables . Weve seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras . 1 the easymoney policy when debt was near 0 % . 2 During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the topend of the economy . Hence the Kshaped recovery . This created asset inflation and we can call it asset inflation because of how PE ratios adjusted for earnings growth have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages . Some of this is structural . Companies today are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history . That can pullforward tomorrows pricing to today . But thats an incomplete story . If we look at capital assets theyve outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply . Thats where the dollars value plunging shows up . This leads me back to my overall argument . The dollar crisis shows up depending on where youre looking . Capping it all off Ill leave you with this scenario Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim . And lets say I print off $ 10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself I would . By every measure M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50 % but does this mean the dollars purchasing power has been cut by 13 No_Its the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollars loss of purchasing power . If I started to then spend that $ 10 Trillion buy all the food from the shelves feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price Im paying then youd see inflation . The rule In a true currency crisis you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transactionrelated friction . For many countries companies and individuals that currency is still the US Dollar . When you have dollars convert your savings into productive assets . Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery . No_other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does ."

      "selftext": "We often hear the standard advice: \"Own more bonds to stay safe.\" Or the classic \"100 minus your age\" rule. But as a data-focused analyst, I’ve always found the standard economic models (like Mean-Variance Optimization) frustrating because they fail to mathematically support long-term stock holding. Standard models penalize stocks for \"upside volatility,\" even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation. I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the *Journal of Finance* titled **\"Bond versus Stock: Investors' Age and Risk Taking\"** (Bali, Demirtas, Levy, Wolf). It uses a framework called **Almost Stochastic Dominance (ASD)** to prove that for rational investors, the \"risk\" of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon. Here is the breakdown of the data (covering U.S. markets 1941–2000): **1. The Short Run (1 Month) is a Coin Flip** If your horizon is 30 days, stocks are not \"investing\" but they are gambling. * **Dominance:** None. Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks beating bonds is only **\\~67%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" (the statistical likelihood of regret) is high at \\~28%. **2. The \"Efficiency\" Shift (48 Months)** The paper found that once you hold for 4 years, the efficient frontier shifts aggressively. * At a 48-month horizon, only portfolios with **80% or more equities** are considered efficient. * If you hold >20% bonds for a 4-year period, you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no rational utility gain. **3. The Magic Number (60 Months)** This is where the \"Time Diversification\" argument becomes irrefutable. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits **\\~98–99%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" shrinks to a negligible **0.24%**. **The Takeaway:** We often confuse \"Volatility\" with \"Risk.\" * In the short term (1 month), volatility IS risk. * In the long term (60 months), volatility is just the mechanism of compounding. If you have a 5-year horizon, \"playing it safe\" with heavy bond exposure isn't actually safe but it is mathematically irrational. So my question is, based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100% in stocks? :) **EDIT** **Hello Guys, based on some questions and discussions, I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section** **Q: \"Valuations (CAPE ratio) are too high. Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich.\"** **A:** While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower *magnitude* of returns (e.g., 4% vs 10%), they do not necessarily flip the *probability* of outperformance vs. bonds below 50% unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre-1990 accounting norms. Post-1990, structural changs (buybacks replacing dividends, capital-light tech) have shifted the normal CAPE range higher. Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha. **Q: \"The 'Stocks Always Win' thesis is Survivorship Bias. What about Japan or Russia?\"** **A:** Valid. The US market is the \"Empire that Won\". However, the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism, not just Ameican exceptionalism. The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification (buying \"The Rest of the World\"), not retreating to Cash or Bonds, which face their own risks (inflation/currency collapse). **Q: \"100% Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash.\"** **A:** Agreed. This is the difference between \"Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality. If holding 20% in bnds prevents an investor from panic-selling the other 80% during a drawdown, that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium, not an inefficiency. The best portfolio is the one you can stick with.",

      "selftext_processed": "We often hear the standard advice Own more bonds to stay safe . Or the classic 100 minus your age rule . But as a datafocused analyst I ’ ve always found the standard economic models like MeanVariance Optimization frustrating because they fail to mathematically support longterm stock holding . Standard models penalize stocks for upside volatility even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation . I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the Journal of Finance titled Bond versus Stock Investors Age and Risk Taking Bali Demirtas Levy Wolf . It uses a framework called Almost Stochastic Dominance ASD to prove that for rational investors the risk of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon . Here is the breakdown of the data covering U.S. markets 1941–2000 1 . The Short Run 1 Month is a Coin Flip If your horizon is 30 days stocks are not_investing but they are gambling . Dominance None . Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices . Win Rate The probability of stocks beating bonds is only 67 % . The Risk The violation area the statistical likelihood of regret is high at 28 % . 2 . The Efficiency Shift 48 Months The paper found that once you hold for 4 years the efficient frontier shifts aggressively . At a 48month horizon only portfolios with 80 % or more equities are considered efficient . If you hold 20 % bonds for a 4year period you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no_rational utility gain . 3 . The Magic Number 60 Months This is where the Time Diversification argument becomes irrefutable . Win Rate The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits 98–99 % . The Risk The violation area shrinks to a negligible 0.24 % . The Takeaway We often confuse Volatility with Risk . In the short term 1 month volatility IS risk . In the long term 60 months volatility is just the mechanism of compounding . If you have a 5year horizon playing it safe with heavy bond exposure isnt actually safe but it is mathematically irrational . So my question is based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100 % in stocks EDIT Hello Guys based on some questions and discussions I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section Q Valuations CAPE ratio are too high . Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich . A While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower magnitude of returns e.g . 4 % vs 10 % they do not_necessarily flip the probability of outperformance vs. bonds below 50 % unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre1990 accounting norms . Post1990 structural changs buybacks replacing dividends capitallight tech have shifted the normal CAPE range higher . Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha . Q The Stocks Always Win thesis is Survivorship Bias . What about Japan or Russia A Valid . The US market is the Empire that Won . However the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism not_just Ameican exceptionalism . The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification buying The Rest of the World not_retreating to Cash or Bonds which face their own risks inflationcurrency collapse . Q 100 % Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash . A Agreed . This is the difference between Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality . If holding 20 % in bnds prevents an investor from panicselling the other 80 % during a drawdown that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium not_an inefficiency . The best portfolio is the one you can stick with ."

My understanding is Warsh at one point advocated for tighter Fed policy, but his views now align with the current administration's. With how much Trump has been pressuring Jerome Powell to lower rates, regularly berating him in front of the media, why do market participants believe Warsh will do anything other than lower rates aggressively? Why would Trump nominate a chair that will defy his demands to quickly and drastically cut rates?",

The agency notes that the December increase in prices for final demand can be traced to a 0.7-percent advance in the index for final demand services. Prices for final demand goods were unchanged. Fed Chair Powell mentioned that they expect the Core PCE Y/Y to be around 3.0% in December. This PPI report is unlikely to trigger big market moves as we await next week's data, with the US NFP report being the main highlight. The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and that's unlikely to change much with this report. The Fed upgraded the current economic outlook in their last policy statement to reflect the improvement in the data. In December, the Fed projected just one cut in 2026, so we will need more labour market deterioration or bigger than expected fall in inflation to see them going faster on rate cuts.",

Fed Chair Powell mentioned that they expect the Core PCE YY to be around 3.0 % in December . This PPI report is unlikely to trigger big market moves as we await next weeks data with the US NFP report being the main highlight . The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and thats unlikely to change much with this report . The Fed upgraded the current economic outlook in their last policy statement to reflect the improvement in the data . In December the Fed projected just one cut in 2026 so we will need more labour market deterioration or bigger than expected fall in inflation to see them going faster on rate cuts ."

      "title": "More DD on Snapchat+ adoption after mandatory pay-for-storage changes",
      "selftext": "I received many DMs after my [first post]( about $SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected, so here it is. **BACKGROUND:** Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee. In-app prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat+. So I compiled data from 80 respondents (37k+ friends in total) to estimate Snap’s earning potential. **THE GOOD NEWS:** I remain confident that subscription-based revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter, which should result in \\~12.5% growth in run-rate revenue and \\~25% bump in enterprise value expectation (though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot) **THE BAD NEWS:** The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat+ subs will not be realized as Q4 revenue, but will instead build rapidly over the next year. This is because of **(1)** steep first-month signup discounts, **(2)** in-app prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter, and **(3)** the fact that “Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription” (from 10-Q). (That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won’t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4). Also, Apple’s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year. **METHOD:** (See Images 3 and 4) I broke down user count by age group and location (US, EU, INDIA/ROW) using DAU reports from the 10Q. I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics. I multiplied the two matrices together, summed to get a demographic-weighted average of DAUs who are subscribed, then multiplied by total DAUs. I also multiplied by a “Zombie factor” to account for inactive users on respondents’ friend lists. This leads me to the 100% increase figure with assumptions: * Of the average user’s friend list, 40% are DAU, 40% are MAU, and 20% are inactive. * People over age 35 (making up 30% of the user base) are completely ignored. * $2/mo subscription plans are completely ignored. **Assumption analysis** INDIA: India accounts for \\~40% of users, so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight. I spent 5 hours on Azar (like Omegle but more popular in India), but I couldn’t get a single Indian user to give me their data (though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat+). So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 1/10 of those in the US for the same age group. I think this is reasonable because Snapchat+ is 50 Rupees per month in India, corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity. DOUBLE-COUNTING: I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed (as opposed to the friend-count-weighted method I used in my first post). **NOTE:** Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low (0.29), so this may not be necessary. INACTIVE USERS: Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis. Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs , I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap+ per DAU metric. Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs. As a 21-year old, I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this: A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity. Also, criminals love Snapchat for self-deleting texts. Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends. **OTHER NOTES:** I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap+ friends. I attribute this to an error in sampling; these users assumed that, because they were sent to a different page than was shown, their Snap+ friend count must be 0. This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection. Snap doesn’t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q, instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards. I won’t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid. Schwab was showing me +$19k in (totally fake) unrealized P&L on Tuesday based on mid-to-market rates (the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x). If anyone knows how to change this, please comment below. **Safe to say I’m down a lot. But I haven’t sold anything.** Holding till Feb 4th. Cross your fingies for me. PS: See the raw data [Here]( I'd love to see your analysis! PPS: If you know any 35-yr-olds or Indians who use Snapchat, please ask them for their data and comment it below.",

      "selftext_processed": "I received many DMs after my first post about $ SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected so here it is . BACKGROUND Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee . Inapp prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat . So I compiled data from 80 respondents 37k friends in total to estimate Snap ’ s earning potential . THE GOOD NEWS I remain confident that subscriptionbased revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter which should result in 12.5 % growth in runrate revenue and 25 % bump in enterprise value expectation though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot THE BAD NEWS The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat subs will not_be realized as Q4 revenue but will instead build rapidly over the next year . This is because of 1 steep firstmonth signup discounts 2 inapp prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter and 3 the fact that “ Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription ” from 10Q . That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won ’ t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4 . Also Apple ’ s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year . METHOD See Images 3 and 4 I broke down user count by age group and location US EU INDIAROW using DAU reports from the 10Q . I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics . I multiplied the two matrices together summed to get a demographicweighted average of DAUs who are subscribed then multiplied by total DAUs . I also multiplied by a “ Zombie factor ” to account for inactive users on respondents ’ friend lists . This leads me to the 100 % increase figure with assumptions Of the average user ’ s friend list 40 % are DAU 40 % are MAU and 20 % are inactive . People over age 35 making up 30 % of the user base are completely ignored . $ 2mo subscription plans are completely ignored . Assumption analysis INDIA India accounts for 40 % of users so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight . I spent 5 hours on Azar like Omegle but more popular in India but I couldn ’ t get a single Indian user to give me their data though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat . So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 110 of those in the US for the same age group . I think this is reasonable because Snapchat is 50 Rupees per month in India corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $ 2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity . DOUBLECOUNTING I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed as opposed to the friendcountweighted method I used in my first post . NOTE Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low 0.29 so this may not_be necessary . INACTIVE USERS Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis . Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap per DAU metric . Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs . As a 21year old I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity . Also criminals love Snapchat for selfdeleting texts . Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends . OTHER NOTES I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap friends . I attribute this to an error in sampling these users assumed that because they were sent to a different page than was shown their Snap friend count must be 0 . This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection . Snap doesn ’ t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards . I won ’ t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid . Schwab was showing me $ 19k in totally fake unrealized PL on Tuesday based on midtomarket rates the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x . If anyone knows how to change this please comment below . Safe to say I ’ m down a lot . But I haven ’ t sold anything . Holding till Feb 4th . Cross your fingies for me . PS See the raw data Here Id love to see your analysis PPS If you know any 35yrolds or Indians who use Snapchat please ask them for their data and comment it below ."

I'm afraid of the long end of the curve shooting up in the next several months. I could currently borrow $100k / 20yrs / 6.32%. If I wanted to lock that in and could invest it in something that yields more but is steady(ish) then I'd be set while I wait. So my question is do you think this is wise? What do you feel is the safest 6.5-7.5% yield I could get? I've looked at JEPI, VZ. I'm sure there's a bunch of options but what do you think and is it even worth it?

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Kevin Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve, bringing an end to months of speculation and uncertainty around the central bank’s leadership. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, saying he’s known Warsh for a long time and believes he’ll be remembered as one of the great Fed chairs. Warsh previously served as a Fed governor during the financial crisis era and has been viewed as a more market-friendly, policy-focused pick. The appointment follows a turbulent period for the Fed, marked by political pressure, public criticism from the White House, and questions about the bank’s independence. Powell’s tenure saw aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation, followed by cuts as growth slowed. Markets are now trying to figure out what this means for monetary policy going forward especially on interest rates, inflation control, and how independent the Fed will remain under new leadership. Curious to hear thoughts: does Warsh bring stability, or does this raise new concerns about political influence over the Fed? Source:",

Trump shared the news on Truth Social saying he ’ s known Warsh for a long time and believes he ’ ll be remembered as one of the great Fed chairs . Warsh previously served as a Fed governor during the financial crisis era and has been viewed as a more marketfriendly policyfocused pick . The appointment follows a turbulent period for the Fed marked by political pressure public criticism from the White House and questions about the bank ’ s independence . Powell ’ s tenure saw aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation followed by cuts as growth slowed . Markets are now trying to figure out what this means for monetary policy going forward especially on interest rates inflation control and how independent the Fed will remain under new leadership . Curious to hear thoughts does Warsh bring stability or does this raise new concerns about political influence over the Fed Source"

I ’ m trying to understand what the market may be reacting to that I missed in my due diligence . Additionally the stock appeared to rally near $ 26 in premarket trading before reversing lower once regular trading began . Was this driven by guidance forward looking commentary or broader market factors Would appreciate any insights from those who followed the call or have a deeper view . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, accelerating its plans as competition with rival Anthropic intensifies. The $500 billion startup is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a potential initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said, and is growing its finance team. That includes the hire of a new chief accounting officer, Ajmere Dale, and a new corporate business finance officer, Cynthia Gaylor, who will oversee investor relations. OpenAI, currently valued around $500 billion, has accelerated its fundraising, reportedly hoping to raise up to $100 billion, while Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbot, is said to be looking to raise about $20 billion. Separately Thursday, the Journal reported that Amazon is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI. And Japan’s SoftBank is reportedly considering investing up to $30 billion in OpenAI. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have been bleeding money, losing billions of dollars annually as they race for the upper hand in the fast-growing artificial-intelligence field. Anthropic hopes to break even in 2028, while OpenAI doesn’t foresee turning a profit until 2030. All of that could make 2026 a huge year for IPOs; Elon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly aiming to go public as soon as June, and Anthropic is also reportedly hoping for a public offering before year’s end.

The comparison underscores SK Hynix's ascension in South Korea's tech space since it was acquired by SK Telecom for about $3 billion in 2012. SK Hynix focuses almost entirely on memory chips, while Samsung operates across multiple businesses, including consumer electronics and contract chip manufacturing. Samsung's memory segment generated operating profits of about 24.9 trillion won in 2025. SK Hynix's success is in large part thanks to its entrenched position as the global leader in high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, a specialized chip used in AI processors and servers such as those produced by Nvidia.",

The comparison underscores SK Hynixs ascension in South Koreas tech space since it was acquired by SK Telecom for about $ 3 billion in 2012 . SK Hynix focuses almost entirely on memory chips while Samsung operates across multiple businesses including consumer electronics and contract chip manufacturing . Samsungs memory segment generated operating profits of about 24.9 trillion won in 2025 . SK Hynixs success is in large part thanks to its entrenched position as the global leader in highbandwidth memory or HBM a specialized chip used in AI processors and servers such as those produced by Nvidia ."

      "selftext": "Samsung Electronics reported an over threefold surge in fourth-quarter profits on Thursday, hitting a new record and beating analysts' estimates, as a memory chip shortage and strong demand for artificial intelligence servers lifted earnings. Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: - Revenue: 93.8 trillion Korean won ($65.58 billion) vs. 93.318 trillion won expected - Operating profit: 20.1 trillion won vs. 20.018 trillion won expected The South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose about 24% from a year earlier to hit a new record. Meanwhile, its operating profit climbed over 200% year over year. The profits surpassed Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018, while matching Samsung's own guidance of around 20 trillion won. Operating profit at the company's mobile experience division fell to 1.9 trillion won, down 9.5% from a year earlier and over 45% from the previous quarter. The company said the losses were due to \"reduced launch effects\" from new smartphone models and intense market competition.",

Management expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $4.655 billion which implies approximately 30% annual revenue growth. Management expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which equates to an annual EBITDA margin of approximately 34%. Management expects adjusted net income of approximately $825 million, which equates to a margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, management expects adjusted EPS of approximately 60 cents per share. In the first quarter of 2026, management expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $1.04 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million, adjusted net income of approximately $160 million, and adjusted EPS of approximately 12 cents per share. Over the medium term, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted net revenue of at least 30% from 2025 to 2028. Additionally, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 38% to 42% from 2025 to 2028. This guidance assumes there are no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions. Management will further address guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call. Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This is because the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures.\" [",

      "selftext": "Note: * Post title says 'surge' which is not accurate. It should be 'rebounded' * Gold -8% and silver -17% was at the lowest point in pre-market. Check the charts at the bottom of this post. Source: [ >Gold and silver suffered the biggest sell-off in years, in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that’s lifted prices to all-time highs. >Gold dropped as much as 8% to crash through $5,000 an ounce, while silver slumped below $100 as the sell-off swept through the broader metals markets. Copper dropped more than 3% in London, after surging above $14,000 a ton for the first time on Thursday, in its biggest intraday jump since 2008. >The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair. The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken. Chinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets. >Silver plunged more than 17% toward $95 an ounce, intensifying a period of extreme volatility that’s rocked the precious metals industry. A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6%, making precious metals more expensive for most buyers. Platinum tumbled more than 10%. >President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair, Bloomberg News reported. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time. >Gold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.” >With gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades. >Even after the pullback, gold is still up around 17% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up nearly 40% so far this year. >The Trump administration’s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela’s leader, along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver.

Gold dropped as much as 8 % to crash through $ 5000 an ounce while silver slumped below $ 100 as the selloff swept through the broader metals markets . Copper dropped more than 3 % in London after surging above $ 14000 a ton for the first time on Thursday in its biggest intraday jump since 2008 . The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair . The greenback ’ s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken . Chinese investors have led the charge buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets . Silver plunged more than 17 % toward $ 95 an ounce intensifying a period of extreme volatility that ’ s rocked the precious metals industry . A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6 % making precious metals more expensive for most buyers . Platinum tumbled more than 10 % . President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair Bloomberg News reported . The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates . Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time . Gold ’ s move “ validates the cautionary tale of fastup fastdown ” said Christopher Wong a strategist at OverseaChinese Banking Corp . While reports of Warsh ’ s nomination were a trigger a correction was overdue he said . “ It ’ s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves. ” With gold and silver jumping so much already this year some technical indicators flashed warning signs . One is the relativestrength index which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction . Gold ’ s RSI recently hit 90 the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades . Even after the pullback gold is still up around 17 % in January closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980 . The jump in silver has been eyewatering with the white metal up nearly 40 % so far this year . The Trump administration ’ s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela ’ s leader along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver . Most recently Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba . Meanwhile the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal . The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1 ...

The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection. The pick of Warsh, 55, likely wouldn’t ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street’s view that he wouldn’t always do Trump’s bidding. “He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn’t going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,” added Bahnsen. Since Powell’s confirmation in 2018, during Trump’s first term, he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, the president kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed’s massive renovation of its Washington, D.C. headquarters.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair ending a fivemonth odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank . The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powellled Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018 . “ I have known Kevin for a long period of time and have no_doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen maybe the best ” said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection . The pick of Warsh 55 likely wouldn ’ t ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street ’ s view that he wouldn ’ t always do Trump ’ s bidding . “ He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets ” said David Bahnsen chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group on CNBC ’ s “ Squawk Box. ” “ There was no_person who was going to get this job who wasn ’ t going to be cutting rates in the short term . However I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate ” added Bahnsen . Since Powell ’ s confirmation in 2018 during Trump ’ s first term he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively . Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025 the president kept up the attack pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed ’ s massive renovation of its Washington D.C. headquarters ."

      "selftext": "Hello, i would like to start an educated discussion on Palantir stock, i’m not predicting anything (i specify it cause the bot keeps deleting the post, is it illegal to discuss stocks on a channel dedicated to stock investing?). This is my take on it: The company ~~has basically ONE~~ depends heavily on one customer, the US government, the same government that has an unmanageable 37 trillion debt that is struggling to get refinanced because everyone seems to be unloading US treasuries. The company has a gigantic CAPEX and a price/earning ratio of ~~more than 200~~ 369 so im pretty bearish on it if i look at the valuation even if i recognise the decent margins and incredible growth that seems undefensible. Can someone still bullish on Palantir explain to me why is it? please add details, i’m open to different ideas than my own. thanks! EDIT: I'm asking for an opinion, i explicitly wrote \"i’m open to different ideas than my own\", i'm not selling my take as gold and some of you had the courtesy to explain my data may not be up-to-date so please keep that in mind and remain respectful, its supposed to be an exchange of ideas not an ideological war.",

      "selftext": "[Breaking News] - Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair. Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. “I’ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,” Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, “I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.” The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite. An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation. “President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor’s term.",

The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder . President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair . Speaking at the premiere for “ Melania ” the film about first lady Melania Trump the president said the fivemonth odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end . “ I ’ ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning ” Trump said . Asked if he had actually settled on a choice he replied “ I do I better otherwise I have to go to work very quickly. ” The process for deciding on Powell ’ s replacement began in September with an 11candidate field that included past and current Fed officials economists and Wall Street investment professionals . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates whittling the list down to five and then four . The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder . Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job . Hassett had been the leader for some time then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder . However that flipped Thursday evening with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80 % favorite . An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday . However a White House official dismissed speculation . “ President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture . Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone ’ s time ” said White House spokesman Kush Desai . For his part Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May . Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor ’ s term ."

      "selftext": "You should look into Etsy and their general circular internal stock compensation/buyback series. Outgoing CEO Josh Silverman was paid over $200 million in sold stock compensation, at a time when the company was overpaying for acquisitions, as seen in their recent dispositions at a 90% loss. While paying executives excessive comp packages, they have announced a non-expiring $1 billion share buyback program as the company sees fit. All the while, they have $3 billion + in debt on the balance sheet that ballooned as a result of the failed acquisitions. The company is not investing in the future, they simply are propping up their share price as the marketplace continues to be flooded with mass-manufactured products and overseas sellers. Their partnerships with AI are further very ambiguous, costing sellers more, and ultimately removing ETSY's need for existence. AI may eventually replace the marketplace altogether by selling direct and allowing customers to engage directly with sellers without the need for Etsy. While some of the above is speculation of the future, the aggressive share buyback program in a time where the company is high in debt, and low in growth, is creating a false sense of value. Etsy is trading at a 38 P/E after recent decline compared to EBAY's 20 P/E and EBAY has been much more successful in terms of scale, margins, and growth since 2021. Price Target would be in the low $30s.",

      "selftext": "Hi! You all know that when markets open they are always somewhat unstable and often rise or fall sharply; there are enormous variations in the first few minutes of the markets (I'm referring to the US markets, which are the only ones that interest me). For example, today the markets started the day falling immensely, most likely due to the shutdown. I didn't know about the shutdown because I'm not American, but if I had known, I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening. Is there a way to know, with some certainty, what will happen when the US markets open? Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open? Thank you very much.

For example today the markets started the day falling immensely most likely due to the shutdown . I didnt know about the shutdown because Im not_American but if I had known I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening . Is there a way to know with some certainty what will happen when the US markets open Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open Thank you very much . Best regards ."

Recently I started watching CNBC and everything seems like 2026 is going to be amazing. Earning are supporting this. Companies are building infrastructure like crazy for AI, there is not enough tech for data centers(memory, processing, data storage…). Caterpillar is up 68 percent in the last year. RCL earning show strong bookings, Apple massive growth in iPhone sales. I am sitting on 50k from a house sale last summer and don’t know what to do. It is in cash and Trump is happy to devalue the dollar, so cash is a bad idea(right)? Gold would be a good place but is it over priced now? SP500 is at record P/E ratios.

Recently I started watching CNBC and everything seems like 2026 is going to be amazing . Earning are supporting this . Companies are building infrastructure like crazy for AI there is not_enough tech for data centersmemory processing data storage… . Caterpillar is up 68 percent in the last year . RCL earning show strong bookings Apple massive growth in iPhone sales . I am sitting on 50k from a house sale last summer and don ’ t know what to do . It is in cash and Trump is happy to devalue the dollar so cash is a bad idearight Gold would be a good place but is it over priced now SP500 is at record PE ratios .

The problem I keep running into is: * The ETFs don’t really line up with what I’m trying to own * They’re either too broad, too US-heavy, or feel like generic tech. * Picking individual stocks feels like committing to constant monitoring and rebalancing, which I honestly don’t want to do What I *do* want is something boring and systematic: * clear inclusion rules * predefined weights * rebalance on a schedule Basically… an index. When I looked into it, I was surprised by how simple index construction actually is (at least conceptually). I know a bit of coding, so I started wondering whether it makes more sense to just build a rule-based \"index\" for myself, instead of forcing myself into ETFs I don’t really trust. Before I go further down this rabbit hole, I’m curious: * Has anyone here tried something like this? * Will this come back and bite me in the back? Genuinely interested in hearing why this is or isn't a good idea.",

Picking individual stocks feels like committing to constant monitoring and rebalancing which I honestly don ’ t want to do What I do want is something boring and systematic clear inclusion rules predefined weights rebalance on a schedule Basically… an index . When I looked into it I was surprised by how simple index construction actually is at least conceptually . I know a bit of coding so I started wondering whether it makes more sense to just build a rulebased index for myself instead of forcing myself into ETFs I don ’ t really trust . Before I go further down this rabbit hole I ’ m curious Has anyone here tried something like this Will this come back and bite me in the back Genuinely interested in hearing why this is or isnt a good idea ."

      "title": "META +10% post-earnings: the $115-135B 2026 capex deserves some reflection",
      "selftext": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday: EPS of ($8.88 vs $8.19 expected), revenue of $59.9 billion (above expectations), and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance (projected revenue of $53.5-56.5 billion, well above the consensus around $51 billion). The most noteworthy point: capex planned for 2026 is between $115 and $135 billion, a very significant increase from $72 billion in 2025. The market reacted positively (the stock is up about +9-10% today, trading around $730-735), while Microsoft, delivering a similar message on AI investments, is down more than 10%. This divergence is interesting. On one hand, investors appear to be endorsing Meta’s strategy: strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization, exploding DAUs, and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers. On the other hand, a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks: potential overcapacity in data centers, delays in generating incremental cash flows, or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown. I’m neither compulsively selling nor buying here, but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious. Historically, when the market heavily rewards large-scale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability, it can sometimes precede later re-evaluations. Apart from that, January 2026 is shaping up to be a triple-threat market moment: * Risk of a government shutdown, * Precious metals breaking all-time historical levels, * And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window. **Why the market is reacting this way** Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that aren't dependent on government stability. That's why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs (gold recently trading around $5,070–$5,268/oz as of late January 2026, amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31). At the same time, tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure. Software is getting cheaper to scale, but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive, forcing a re-evaluation of valuations. Personally, this kind of announcement makes me uneasy. I’ve seen past cycles where the market celebrated massive CAPEX long before returns actually materialized. What matters with Meta today isn’t just the size of the AI investments, but the timing: the market is rewarding the story before the economics are fully proven. A +10% move after earnings is impressive, but it’s not yet proof that $115–135B will translate into real shareholder value. For me, the more sensible approach right now is to stay defensive, focus on the short term (both long and short), and only scale exposure when clearer “green lights” start to appear. That's why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week (easy long and short exposure, leverage to improve capital efficiency). How do you read this situation? * Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance? * Are you trimming or staying neutral, waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments? * Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names? I’m curious about your takes, especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context (interest rates, ad growth, competition). Let’s discuss calmly and factually.",

      "selftext_processed": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday EPS of $ 8.88 vs $ 8.19 expected revenue of $ 59.9 billion above expectations and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance projected revenue of $ 53.556.5 billion well above the consensus around $ 51 billion . The most noteworthy point capex planned for 2026 is between $ 115 and $ 135 billion a very significant increase from $ 72 billion in 2025 . The market reacted positively the stock is up about 910 % today trading around $ 730735 while Microsoft delivering a similar message on AI investments is down more than 10 % . This divergence is interesting . On one hand investors appear to be endorsing Meta ’ s strategy strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization exploding DAUs and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers . On the other hand a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks potential overcapacity in data centers delays in generating incremental cash flows or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown . I ’ m neither_compulsively selling nor buying here but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious . Historically when the market heavily rewards largescale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability it can sometimes precede later reevaluations . Apart from that January 2026 is shaping up to be a triplethreat market moment Risk of a government shutdown Precious metals breaking alltime historical levels And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window . Why the market is reacting this way Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that arent dependent on government stability . Thats why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs gold recently trading around $ 5070– $ 5268oz as of late January 2026 amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31 . At the same time tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure . Software is getting cheaper to scale but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive forcing a reevaluation of valuations . Personally this kind of announcement makes me uneasy . I ’ ve seen past cycles where the market celebrated massive CAPEX long before returns actually materialized . What matters with Meta today isn ’ t just the size of the AI investments but the timing the market is rewarding the story before the economics are fully proven . A 10 % move after earnings is impressive but it ’ s not_yet proof that $ 115–135B will translate into real shareholder value . For me the more sensible approach right now is to stay defensive focus on the short term both long and short and only scale exposure when clearer “ green lights ” start to appear . Thats why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week easy long and short exposure leverage to improve capital efficiency . How do you read this situation Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance Are you trimming or staying neutral waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names I ’ m curious about your takes especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context interest rates ad growth competition . Let ’ s discuss calmly and factually ."

Before you call me a regard, I already know I am (so are you so shut up), and I already know that this stock runs purely on vibes... But in a world where Elon can helicopter his little ween around stage and pump Tesla on the promise of sexbots and trash xAI, why can't Peter Thiel do the same thing? Especially when the stock is DOWN 3% over the past 6 months... PLTR is as polarizing as AI gets in the United States, and all it takes is one ridiculous announcement for it to go boom boom... Don't tell me we don't get those daily for the last couple months. Not only are they the premier AI for the military, but PLTR is driving profitability insights for some of the biggest companies and health systems in the country. This announcement can come from the man upstairs, and/or during earnings - it literally doesn't matter. It's time to cycle some money back towards the bad guys. If there's one thing I've learned over the past year, it's to bet on the rich guys. Clearly NFA. I'm not rich, handsome, or smart... But I'm not dim enough for options. 30k in shares below.",

Before you call me a regard I already know I am so are you so shut up and I already know that this stock runs purely on vibes ... But in a world where Elon can helicopter his little ween around stage and pump Tesla on the promise of sexbots and trash xAI why cant Peter Thiel do the same thing Especially when the stock is DOWN 3 % over the past 6 months ... PLTR is as polarizing as AI gets in the United States and all it takes is one ridiculous announcement for it to go boom boom ... Dont tell me we dont get those daily for the last couple months . Not_only are they the premier AI for the military but PLTR is driving profitability insights for some of the biggest companies and health systems in the country . This announcement can come from the man upstairs andor during earnings it literally doesnt matter . Its time to cycle some money back towards the bad guys . If theres one thing Ive learned over the past year its to bet on the rich guys . Clearly NFA . Im not_rich handsome or smart ... But Im not_dim enough for options . 30k in shares below ."

I had $30 in WS physical gold but don’t care too much about the physical aspect to be honest. By the sounds of it ETF might be better suited for me. I’m not sure whether I am low or high risk. I plan to hold for a while but I’ve never been good at planning 20-30 years ahead. Not sure what my best route is. I see a lot about getting ZGLD, CGL, kilo.b, kilo.u, kilo, hygh? cgl.c, hgy Idk if I’m just confusing myself at this point. Any insight is greatly appreciated, thanks!

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested.?",

I know that investing in individual stocks is generally less efficient than investing in ETFs, and in fact my entire portfolio is currently made up of ETFs. That said, I was wondering about allocating a small percentage of my portfolio to riskier investments, such as picking a few individual stocks. Do you also like to “gamble” with a small portion of your portfolio, or do you strictly stick to a passive investment strategy and keep things simple?",

      "title": "Why Abu Dhabi? (And why investors are now choosing it over Dubai)",
      "selftext": "LONG READ WARNING! :) Hello everyone, as a property investment consultant & broker in the UAE, lately, a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market. I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE, but isn't sure where to start, which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet. I'll give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market & explain the best areas to invest in. To give you a little background information, Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago (Dubai has been offering this since 2002, for comparison). In the first half of 2025, there were only 4000 new off-plan units launched in Abu Dhabi, whereas in the same time frame, there were about 65,000 launched in Dubai. Abu Dhabi's population is currently growing much faster than Dubai's (twice as much in the last year), and continues to grow rapidly, so the rental demand & yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage. Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours & experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabi's real estate market. In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD (+39% YoY). \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at: • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer off-plan developments but with very high potential: • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO: \\- ALDAR (They lead the market & have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi. Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out & Aldar properties hold their value very well) \\- SOBHA \\- MODON \\- SAAS Properties \\- Bloom Holding \\- OBJECT 1 \\- ICT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI: For reference, when you buy off-plan property directly from a developer in the UAE, whether you're a resident or a foreign investor, you have the option to go with a \"payment plan\" which will usually look something like this \"60/40 10% down\" or \"65/35 5% down\" and there are a lot of different options. The breakdown goes as follows: For 60/40 - 10% down: 10% of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2% govt fees 50% is paid in 4-6 installments over the course of (usually) 3 years while the property is under development 40% is paid once the project is completed & your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the \"Early stage flip\" & \"Pre-handover exit\" Early stage flip: Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment, 5% or 10% in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply (because not all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want) and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch. Basically before the next installment is due (usually around 6 months from purchase), investors resell the contract at a premium, typically in the range of $50,000-$150,000, depending on the project. Pre-handover edit: investors continue paying installments over the construction period. By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due, market value has often appreciated significantly, especially when the asset is from a top developer & in a strong location. So for example, a unit purchased at $460K may be valued at around $730K-$820K before handover, allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term. Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term, capital appreciation can be a lot higher, especially in prime locations. The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Now let's expand on the areas i mentioned earlier, 1. YAS ISLAND: \\- Entertainment + Tourism Hub (Beaches, Golf, Theme parks, Nightlife, Sports, Concerts, MMA, F1, etc.) \\- Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi. (This is important because it will further boost tourism & demand in the area and drive property value up.) Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6.5-8.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 12-18% YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx. 8-11% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $400K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$800K • Villas & Townhouses - $1.3M-$4m+ 2. SAADIYAT ISLAND (my personal favorite): \\- Lifestyle, Cultural District & Luxury: \\- Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest long-term real estate investments in the UAE. The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers, supported by limited supply & prestige branding. Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI. Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years. The Island is Abu Dhabi's art & cultural district & has museums such as the Louvre, the Guggenheim, The national history museum & Sheikh Zayed museum. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 5.5-7.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 15-28% YoY (one of the highest in the UAE) • Apartment Value Growth approx. 10-15% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $700K-$1.4M+ • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $1.5M+ • Villas & Townhouses - $3M+ 3. AL REEM ISLAND: \\- More affordable than Saadiyat & Yas island but still very popular. A great community that's popular with younger professionals and expats. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6-9% • Apartment Value Growth approx. 7-12% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $150K-$250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $250K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $750K-$1.2M • 4+ Bedroom Villas - $1.7M-$2.5M+ 4. HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND \\- A sports & lifestyle hub. Mostly beachfront living, with a focus on sports & wellness. Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now. All the projects launched there are selling out instantly. For example, the most recent one was \"Bashayer\" by MODON. It sold out in 1 day, generating 3 Billion AED in sales. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3+ Bedroom Villas - $1.2M-$2.5M 5. FAHID ISLAND \\- Fahid Island is developed by Aldar & is a wellness-focused island positioned between Yas Island & Saadiyat Island & one of the most anticipated master-planned developments in Abu Dhabi. Its designed around low-density living, walkability, greenery, beaches and curated community facilities & Its attracting strong investor & end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation & the islands strategic location. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $1.2M-$2M 5. RAMHAN ISLAND \\- Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills, focusing on private waterfront villas, private beaches & resort-style living. It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabi's most exclusive residential projects. The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors & end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value, privacy and long term capital appreciation potential. Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle that's still close to the city. Typical Prices: • 3-7 Bedroom Villas - $2.5M - $10M Personally, I really believe in Saadiyat Island, Yas Island & Hudairiyat as long-term investments. I purchased off-plan property in Saadiyat myself last year & hope to invest in another project there soon as well. Given the market history, the governments investments & support in developing the areas, and the very limited space left to build, i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce. The scarcity combined with their prime locations, makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now. To give you an idea, The off-plan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $1M (I've only paid the 5% down payment + 2% + first installment so far, in total about $120k), I could already sell for a $70k-$85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat. If you'd like to do a bit of research yourself, look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island, for example, from last year like \"Mamsha Gardens\" & \"The Row\", then look at the current resale prices they're listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT. This will give you an idea of how fast off-plan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat. Since i'm mostly explaining off-plan investments here and also since theres of course, a lot more information about off-plan, the secondary market & UAE real estate in general, for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further, feel free to ask & I'm happy to answer!",

      "selftext_processed": "LONG READ WARNING Hello everyone as a property investment consultant broker in the UAE lately a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market . I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE but isnt sure where to start which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet . Ill give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market explain the best areas to invest in . To give you a little background information Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital Abu Dhabi . The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago Dubai has been offering this since 2002 for comparison . In the first half of 2025 there were only 4000 new offplan units launched in Abu Dhabi whereas in the same time frame there were about 65000 launched in Dubai . Abu Dhabis population is currently growing much faster than Dubais twice as much in the last year and continues to grow rapidly so the rental demand yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage . Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabis real estate market . In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD 39 % YoY . _____ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer offplan developments but with very high potential • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island _____ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO ALDAR They lead the market have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi . Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out Aldar properties hold their value very well SOBHA MODON SAAS Properties Bloom Holding OBJECT 1 ICT _____ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI For reference when you buy offplan property directly from a developer in the UAE whether youre a resident or a foreign investor you have the option to go with a payment plan which will usually look something like this 6040 10 % down or 6535 5 % down and there are a lot of different options . The breakdown goes as follows For 6040 10 % down 10 % of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2 % govt fees 50 % is paid in 46 installments over the course of usually 3 years while the property is under development 40 % is paid once the project is completed your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the Early stage flip Prehandover exit Early stage flip Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment 5 % or 10 % in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply because not_all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch . Basically before the next installment is due usually around 6 months from purchase investors resell the contract at a premium typically in the range of $ 50000 $ 150000 depending on the project . Prehandover edit investors continue paying installments over the construction period . By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due market value has often appreciated significantly especially when the asset is from a top developer in a strong location . So for example a unit purchased at $ 460K may be valued at around $ 730K $ 820K before handover allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term . Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term capital appreciation can be a lot higher especially in prime locations . The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling . _____ Now lets expand on the areas i mentioned earlier 1 . YAS ISLAND Entertainment Tourism Hub Beaches Golf Theme parks Nightlife Sports Concerts MMA F1 etc . Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi . This is important because it will further boost tourism demand in the area and drive property value up .

SAADIYAT ISLAND my personal favorite Lifestyle Cultural District Luxury Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest longterm real estate investments in the UAE . The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers supported by limited supply prestige branding . Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI . Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years . The Island is Abu Dhabis art cultural district has museums such as the Louvre the Guggenheim The national history museum Sheikh Zayed museum .

HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND A sports lifestyle hub . Mostly beachfront living with a focus on sports wellness . Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now . All the projects launched there are selling out instantly . For example the most recent one was Bashayer by MODON . It sold out in 1 day generating 3 Billion AED in sales . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Villas $ 1.2M $ 2.5M 5 . FAHID ISLAND Fahid Island is developed by Aldar is a wellnessfocused island positioned between Yas Island Saadiyat Island one of the most anticipated masterplanned developments in Abu Dhabi . Its designed around lowdensity living walkability greenery beaches and curated community facilities Its attracting strong investor end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation the islands strategic location . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments $ 1.2M $ 2M 5 . RAMHAN ISLAND Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills focusing on private waterfront villas private beaches resortstyle living . It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabis most exclusive residential projects . The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value privacy and long term capital appreciation potential . Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle thats still close to the city . Typical Prices • 37 Bedroom Villas $ 2.5M $ 10M Personally I really believe in Saadiyat Island Yas Island Hudairiyat as longterm investments . I purchased offplan property in Saadiyat myself last year hope to invest in another project there soon as well . Given the market history the governments investments support in developing the areas and the very limited space left to build i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce . The scarcity combined with their prime locations makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now . To give you an idea The offplan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $ 1M Ive only paid the 5 % down payment 2 % first installment so far in total about $ 120k I could already sell for a $ 70k $ 85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat . If youd like to do a bit of research yourself look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island for example from last year like Mamsha Gardens The Row then look at the current resale prices theyre listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT . This will give you an idea of how fast offplan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat . Since im mostly explaining offplan investments here and also since theres of course a lot more information about offplan the secondary market UAE real estate in general for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further feel free to ask Im happy to answer"

      "selftext": "From [The Guardian](#selection-1451.0-1523.194): The surge in the gold price is showing no sign of abating, as bullion continues to soar. Gold has jumped over the $5,500 an ounce level this morning, just three days after hitting $5,000 for the first time, taking its gains so far this year to almost 30% (!). It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets, looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar, which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency’s year‑to‑date softness. That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement, boosting gold’s attractiveness. As Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, explains: “That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher, as the price keeps climbing, and given renewed impetus by Trump’s comments on the dollar. This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats, as it reinforces their thesis. “Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum, something comes along to rescue it. So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar, the future for gold looks bright indeed.” Concerns around the independence of America’s central bank are also lifting gold. Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night, it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year. That could weaken the dollar further, and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price. The rise in precious metals prices is “breathtaking and profoundly scary”, warns Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings Institute. He writes: “The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum. “At the same time, we’re seeing government bond markets in high-debt countries like Japan under severe pressure, even as there’s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger. We’re at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt. Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “safe haven” bid as part of this phenomenon.”",

      "selftext_processed": "From The Guardianselection1451.01523.194 The surge in the gold price is showing no_sign of abating as bullion continues to soar . Gold has jumped over the $ 5500 an ounce level this morning just three days after hitting $ 5000 for the first time taking its gains so far this year to almost 30 % . It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty . Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency ’ s year‑to‑date softness . That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement boosting gold ’ s attractiveness . As Chris Beauchamp Chief Market Analyst at IG explains “ That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher as the price keeps climbing and given renewed impetus by Trump ’ s comments on the dollar . This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats as it reinforces their thesis . “ Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum something comes along to rescue it . So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar the future for gold looks bright indeed. ” Concerns around the independence of America ’ s central bank are also lifting gold . Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year . That could weaken the dollar further and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price . The rise in precious metals prices is “ breathtaking and profoundly scary ” warns Robin Brooks senior fellow at Brookings Institute . He writes “ The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum . “ At the same time we ’ re seeing government bond markets in highdebt countries like Japan under severe pressure even as there ’ s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden Norway and Switzerland . Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger . We ’ re at the start of a global debt crisis with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away outofcontrol debt . Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “ safe haven ” bid as part of this phenomenon . ”"

      "selftext": "Hello, I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing. I am tackling it 3 ways. 1. Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $100 when creating a new account and depositing $100. Not sure if I chose it or not, but they put the $100+$100 in some mixed tech stock. Google, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. From then until now the $200 grew to $268.12. 2. To dabble in Crypto mining, I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash. Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit, but it seems to be hanging in there. They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC, ie, about $21. I am probably losing money due to electricity cost, but they are heating my house :) I intend to move them to my off-grid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment, basically free electricity. It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost, but that is already money down the drain. 3. I took advantage of a Rakuten $150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $200 within a month. I just bought $210 worth of BTC which had a $3.10 fee. Will have to wait for the $150 CB. On the surface, my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something. I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys, but it is a start. I suspect my 36a of off-grid property in AZ was my best purchase. Are you guys on team crypto, or team stocks, or perhaps team real estate? I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made, and I couldn't pass up the CB on the Kraken account, but not sure where I should move the money? Thoughts? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing . I am tackling it 3 ways . 1 . Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $ 100 when creating a new account and depositing $ 100 . Not_sure if I chose it or not_but they put the $ 100 $ 100 in some mixed tech stock . Google Apple Nvidia Amazon and Microsoft . From then until now the $ 200 grew to $ 268.12 . 2 . To dabble in Crypto mining I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash . Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit but it seems to be hanging in there . They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC ie about $ 21 . I am probably losing money due to electricity cost but they are heating my house I intend to move them to my offgrid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment basically free electricity . It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost but that is already money down the drain . 3 . I took advantage of a Rakuten $ 150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $ 200 within a month . I just bought $ 210 worth of BTC which had a $ 3.10 fee . Will have to wait for the $ 150 CB . On the surface my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something . I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys but it is a start . I suspect my 36a of offgrid property in AZ was my best purchase . Are you guys on team crypto or team stocks or perhaps team real estate I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made and I couldnt pass up the CB on the Kraken account but not_sure where I should move the money Thoughts Thanks"

      "selftext": "hola fella regards. ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it, without having spend the nearly $100k that most sell-side shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports? DBS has you covered! here's the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with \"equity research filetype:pdf\" on google. scroll a bit down, and you'll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock. [for example, just searching up \"CVX equity reseach filetype:pdf\" got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron]( 2. once you're there, press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at. using the chevron example, you change it from [ to [ by just by changing that last part at the end (make sure to capitalize it!) i have no idea what type of [security pre-cautions]( DBS has employed, but nearly every mega-cap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see. for example... **mag 7 coverage from DBS** Tesla - [ Meta - [ Apple - [ Google - [ Nvidia - [ Amazon - [ Microsoft - [ yep... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available. you know... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too. i honestly have no idea when they're going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not to bring up. if you've ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings... here's your shot. **edit: i've managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not only publish their analyst reports, but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a \"report\" analysts shit out when they need to justify upgrading or downgrading. all you need to do is search \"industry dbs filetype:pdf\"** technology outlook: [ 2026 outlook: [ weekly macro insights from their chief economist (link auto-downloads the pdf): [google

      "selftext_processed": "hola fella regards . ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it without having spend the nearly $ 100k that most sellside shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports DBS has you covered heres the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with equity research filetypepdf on google . scroll a bit down and youll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock . for example just searching up CVX equity reseach filetypepdf got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron 2. once youre there press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at . using the chevron example you change it from to by just by changing that last part at the end make sure to capitalize it i have no_idea what type of security precautions DBS has employed but nearly every megacap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see . for example ... mag 7 coverage from DBS Tesla Meta Apple Google Nvidia Amazon Microsoft yep ... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available . you know ... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too . i honestly have no_idea when theyre going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not_to bring up . if youve ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings ... heres your shot . edit ive managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not_only publish their analyst reports but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching a small Finnish company called **Canatu**, and it’s one of the most interesting investments I’ve come across in a while. It’s not a semiconductor company, not an AI company, and not a software business. It sits much deeper in the stack, at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on. ***Quick disclaimer:*** *this is a deep-tech, supply-chain-driven idea. It’s not a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics. If that’s not your thing, feel free to skip. Also, none of this is investment advice.* The core of the thesis is simple: advanced chips are now constrained by physics, not software. As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography, the limiting factor is no longer design, but materials. When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers, even microscopic weaknesses become billion-dollar problems. At the center of this process is the photomask, the blueprint of the chip. To protect it from contamination, EUV machines use an ultra-thin membrane called a pellicle. If a single dust particle hits the mask, yield can collapse instantly. Pellicles are therefore mandatory, but existing silicon-based pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases. This is where Canatu enters the picture. They’ve developed carbon-nanotube (CNT) pellicles that can withstand far higher heat, deform far less, and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions. As EUV systems transition toward High-NA EUV, those properties shift from nice to have to necessary. What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don’t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer. Instead, they’re trying to scale via a licensing + tool model: * Reactor sales (specialized production equipment) * Proprietary consumables (inputs needed to run the reactor) * Per-unit licensing fees (royalty for each pellicle produced) So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity, while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard. That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables, not permanent components. As EUV power rises, pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases. Even if High-NA EUV is a minority of wafer volume, it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate. From a market structure perspective, this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV. Think ARM rather than Intel, or Entegris rather than TSMC. If chips are made on ASML machines, something must sit between the photons and the mask, and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles. There are also real validation signals. Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST, a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung’s ecosystem. Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients (commonly speculated as Samsung + TSMC). Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly. One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV, because this is where the non-linear upside comes from. The key insight is that pellicle demand does not scale with wafer volume, but with exposure intensity. High-NA tools use higher source power, more EUV layers per wafer, and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles, which shortens their usable life. In practical terms, a High-NA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a Low-NA tool. When you combine a slow but steady increase in High-NA share with higher burn rates, you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption. Even under conservative assumptions, my model shows pellicle demand in leading-edge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as High-NA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade. This is still a small-cap (\\~€300M), listed on Nasdaq First North Finland, it is a SPAC, so some future dilution from warrants and earn-outs is expected. That said, I find the asymmetry compelling. This isn’t a bet on which AI company wins. It’s a bet that physics does not negotiate, and that when an industry hits hard material limits, small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable. I’m curious how others here view this kind of deep supply-chain infrastructure play, especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience. Happy to be challenged.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been researching a small Finnish company called Canatu and it ’ s one of the most interesting investments I ’ ve come across in a while . It ’ s not_a semiconductor company not_an AI company and not_a software business . It sits much deeper in the stack at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on . Quick disclaimer this is a deeptech supplychaindriven idea . It ’ s not_a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics . If that ’ s not_your thing feel free to skip . Also none of this is investment advice . The core of the thesis is simple advanced chips are now constrained by physics not_software . As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography the limiting factor is no_longer design but materials . When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers even microscopic weaknesses become billiondollar problems . At the center of this process is the photomask the blueprint of the chip . To protect it from contamination EUV machines use an ultrathin membrane called a pellicle . If a single dust particle hits the mask yield can collapse instantly . Pellicles are therefore mandatory but existing siliconbased pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases . This is where Canatu enters the picture . They ’ ve developed carbonnanotube CNT pellicles that can withstand far higher heat deform far less and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions . As EUV systems transition toward HighNA EUV those properties shift from nice to have to necessary . What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don ’ t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer . Instead they ’ re trying to scale via a licensing tool model Reactor sales specialized production equipment Proprietary consumables inputs needed to run the reactor Perunit licensing fees royalty for each pellicle produced So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard . That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables not_permanent components . As EUV power rises pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases . Even if HighNA EUV is a minority of wafer volume it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate . From a market structure perspective this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV . Think ARM rather than Intel or Entegris rather than TSMC . If chips are made on ASML machines something must sit between the photons and the mask and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles . There are also real validation signals . Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung ’ s ecosystem . Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients commonly speculated as Samsung TSMC . Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly . One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from LowNA to HighNA EUV because this is where the nonlinear upside comes from . The key insight is that pellicle demand does not_scale with wafer volume but with exposure intensity . HighNA tools use higher source power more EUV layers per wafer and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles which shortens their usable life . In practical terms a HighNA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a LowNA tool . When you combine a slow but steady increase in HighNA share with higher burn rates you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption . Even under conservative assumptions my model shows pellicle demand in leadingedge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as HighNA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade . This is still a smallcap €300M listed on Nasdaq First North Finland it is a SPAC so some future dilution from warrants and earnouts is expected . That said I find the asymmetry compelling . This isn ’ t a bet on which AI company wins . It ’ s a bet that physics does not_negotiate and that when an industry hits hard material limits small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable . I ’ m curious how others here view this kind of deep supplychain infrastructure play especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience . Happy to be challenged ."

      "selftext": "*Preface:* I am not looking for financial advice, I will continue to do my own research, I am mainly looking for new funds to explore and expand my perspectives on my strategy. I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments, even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor and/or the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in. I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction, so I am hoping that I can do that here. I’ll also say upfront: Bogleheads, I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult, but I am hoping to avoid that debate here. Thank you in advance. All of my money is now with Fidelity. I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far, especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees. **Current balances:** * Roth IRA: \\~$90k * 401k: \\~$95k * Taxable (TOD): \\~$18k **Current allocations:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 25% FDCPX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 65% FSELX * 25% FXAIX * 10% AGTHX (legacy holding from American Funds) I’m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy, but I’m starting to think more about diversification. I’m especially curious whether there are any non-tech or non-semiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong long-term returns. I know I want to replace FDCPX, since it’s also tech-heavy and overlaps with FSELX, I am just not sure with what yet. I’ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX, but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX, which appears more growth- and tech-concentrated. **Restructure plan as of now:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 15% FSENX * 10% FFFCX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 40% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 20% FSENX * 10% AGTHX * 5% FFFCX I’m interested in hearing how others think about this - not necessarily what to do, but how to think about it, although I am open to some suggestions.",

I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor andor the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in . I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction so I am hoping that I can do that here . I ’ ll also say upfront Bogleheads I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult but I am hoping to avoid that debate here . Thank you in advance . All of my money is now with Fidelity . I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees . Current balances Roth IRA $ 90k 401k $ 95k Taxable TOD $ 18k Current allocations Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 25 % FDCPX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 65 % FSELX 25 % FXAIX 10 % AGTHX legacy holding from American Funds I ’ m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy but I ’ m starting to think more about diversification . I ’ m especially curious whether there are any nontech or nonsemiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong longterm returns . I know I want to replace FDCPX since it ’ s also techheavy and overlaps with FSELX I am just not_sure with what yet . I ’ ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX which appears more growth and techconcentrated . Restructure plan as of now Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 15 % FSENX 10 % FFFCX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 40 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 20 % FSENX 10 % AGTHX 5 % FFFCX I ’ m interested in hearing how others think about this not_necessarily what to do but how to think about it although I am open to some suggestions ."

Something like the top 10 positive contributors and the top 10 negative contributors by weight to that ETF. If, for instance, stock A is 5% of the ETF and it went up 8%, it would have contributed +0.4% to the fund’s performance. If stock B is 1% of the fund, and went down by 20%, it would have contributed -0.2%. So, if VOO is down, why? Did Nvidia drop a fair amount and everything else was stable, or did all the banks drop due to a regulation change, etc? I can find S&P 500 movers but, since they are not weighted, it doesn’t tell the story. Not to mention I am looking for this for any given ETF. Does this exist and my searches suck? Does this not exist because it’s solved another way?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building my portfolio for a few years now, but with the current sentiment around an AI bubble, I’m starting to feel over-leveraged in tech. Currently sitting on about $70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy. Portfolio Breakdown: • VOO: $30k (Taxable) • Tencent (TCEHY): $10k • Roth IRA: $20k (Broad market ETFs) • Misc: $10k in individual stocks The Concern: Between VOO’s heavy weighting in mag-seven/AI and my Tencent position, my exposure to a tech correction is significant. I’m trying to decide the best way to \"crash-proof\" without being an emotional seller. Specifically: 1. Stop-Losses vs. Hedging: Does anyone actually use limit sells/stop-losses for long-term holds like VOO, or is the risk of being \"stopped out\" during a flash dip too high? 2. The Tencent Position: It’s a large chunk of my individual holdings. Given the current macro environment, would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector? 3. Strategy: For those who think we are in a bubble, are you staying the course with the S&P 500, or are you moving toward a higher bond/cash position to buy a potential dip? Not looking to \"time the market\" perfectly, just want to ensure I'm not being reckless by holding through a potential 2000-style tech pop.",

Currently sitting on about $ 70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy . Portfolio Breakdown • VOO $ 30k Taxable • Tencent TCEHY $ 10k • Roth IRA $ 20k Broad market ETFs • Misc $ 10k in individual stocks The Concern Between VOO ’ s heavy weighting in magsevenAI and my Tencent position my exposure to a tech correction is significant . I ’ m trying to decide the best way to crashproof without being an emotional seller . Specifically 1 . StopLosses vs . Hedging Does anyone actually use limit sellsstoplosses for longterm holds like VOO or is the risk of being stopped out during a flash dip too high 2 . The Tencent Position It ’ s a large chunk of my individual holdings . Given the current macro environment would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector 3 . Strategy For those who think we are in a bubble are you staying the course with the SP 500 or are you moving toward a higher bondcash position to buy a potential dip Not_looking to time the market perfectly just want to ensure Im not_being reckless by holding through a potential 2000style tech pop ."

To train and run large-scale AI, you also need: \\- Infrastructure (data centers, networking, cooling) \\- Energy (significant power to run the systems) This means that the economic upside isn’t limited to the big tech names. Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues. AI is more then digital, it’s physical, capital-intensive, and energy-dependant. Do you think the real AI winners are the mega-caps everyone knows, or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies?",

To train and run largescale AI you also need Infrastructure data centers networking cooling Energy significant power to run the systems This means that the economic upside isn ’ t limited to the big tech names . Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues . AI is more then digital it ’ s physical capitalintensive and energydependant . Do you think the real AI winners are the megacaps everyone knows or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies"

      "selftext": "Selling VUG in taxable account to rebalance I’m 27 and have about $27,000 in a taxable brokerage account with Robinhood. I was investing 50/30/20 in VOO/VUG/VXUS, and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance. I would like to now aim for a 70/30 split in VOO/VXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth, especially with a looming tech bubble. My question is, should I: 1) sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOO/VXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15% capital gains bracket based on my standard income? 2) sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop, and keep investing in VTI going forward? 3) not touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOO/VXUS or VTI/VXUS moving forward? Best I can figure is about $150 in taxes from capital gains, which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that’s down $144. Is that all not worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me? Edit: I got my tax loss harvesting wrong, my gains from VUG are about $1000 so the -$144 from the stock does very little.",
