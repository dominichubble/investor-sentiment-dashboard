      "selftext": "**USAR: 90% convinced, need a gut check before sizing up** Started a small position today at $16.58. Everything says this should be bigger. Talk me out of it. **What they do:** USA Rare Earth owns Round Top Mountain in Texas. Only major domestic deposit of heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium. These go into every F-35 (920 lbs per plane), EV motor, wind turbine, missile guidance system. China controls 99% of global heavy rare earth processing. **Why now:** * Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits * China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure * Stillwater, Oklahoma magnet facility starts production Q1 2026 * Acquired Less Common Metals for $100M in November - only scaled rare earth metal producer outside China **Numbers:** * $5.56 to $43.98 in 2025, now $16-17. Down 60% from highs * $2.5B market cap. MP Materials is $10B with $400M DoD backing * Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash * All Buy ratings, average target $23 **Bull case:** * MP got $400M government equity. USAR CEO says \"in close communication with administration\" * Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed * Stillwater revenue starts Q1 2026. First proof they can produce * China export restrictions return November 2026 **Bear case:** * Stillwater was supposed to produce in 2023, now 2026 * 211% dilution in 2025. More coming * MP already operational, profitable, government-backed * No confirmed government money yet **What I need:** Am I missing something on the bear case? Is dilution worse than I think? Wait for Stillwater confirmation? **Position:** 257 shares at $16.58. Considering 500-1000 more to hit 5-7% of portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Recently added position in UAMY. Dropping my DD. Thesis in short: UAMY is moving from being a raw material buyer to a vertically integrated domestic producer, a shift that management expects to triple profit margins from 20% to \\~60%. 2026 revenue guidance is recently raised to $125 million and the Thompson Falls smelter expansion coming online this month to increase output fivefold, the fundamental floor significantly higher than in previous years. Wall Street remains bullish, with a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating and an average price target of $9.86 to $17, representing a \\~30% to 120% upside from current levels. Currently a 17.86% short interest is attempting to break the momentum of a massive institutional accumulation phase. Retention of price levels in the $7-8 range is likely to result in a gamma/short squeeze pushing the stock beyond $11. Stoch RSI is oversold, and relief rally to squeeze shorts should be imminent. Western Antimony supply is highly limited. UAMY is a strategic geopolitical stock pick, critical for defense, and is unlikely to see Antimony-specific China export ban repealed. US law will require defense to use non-Chinese sourced antimony - a big UAMY tailwind, as the only active smelter and refiner. 🍀🥸 $UAMY GL.",

Wall Street remains bullish with a consensus Strong Buy rating and an average price target of $ 9.86 to $ 17 representing a 30 % to 120 % upside from current levels . Currently a 17.86 % short interest is attempting to break the momentum of a massive institutional accumulation phase . Retention of price levels in the $ 78 range is likely to result in a gammashort squeeze pushing the stock beyond $ 11 . Stoch RSI is oversold and relief rally to squeeze shorts should be imminent . Western Antimony supply is highly limited . UAMY is a strategic geopolitical stock pick critical for defense and is unlikely to see Antimonyspecific China export ban repealed . US law will require defense to use nonChinese sourced antimony a big UAMY tailwind as the only active smelter and refiner . 🍀🥸 $ UAMY GL ."

      "selftext": "Silver hit a record high and gold rose as weaker-than-expected US inflation data supported the case for more interest rate cuts, while the geopolitical situation remained tense. The white metal advanced as much as 3.5% to touch $89.9965 an ounce, while gold traded near an all-time peak. Underlying inflation in December was not as high as feared, although economists said the data was artificially depressed by the record-long government shutdown late last year. Precious metals have made a strong start to 2026, after blistering rallies last year, with the prospect of a criminal indictment against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reviving worries about the monetary authority’s independence. Central bankers across the world have rallied behind Powell and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the political intervention could backfire. Haven demand has also been aided by US President Donald Trump’s capture of Venezuela’s leader, his renewed threats to take Greenland, and violent protests in Iran that could lead to a toppling of the Islamic regime there. Citigroup Inc. analysts upgraded their forecasts this week for gold and silver to $5,000 per ounce and $100 an ounce, respectively, in the next three months. Silver outperformed gold last year, surging almost 150% thanks to a short squeeze in October and persistent supply tightness in London. Traders are waiting for the outcome of the US Section 232 investigation, which could lead to tariffs on silver. Concern over the potential levy has tied up metal in US warehouses, tightening global inventories. Spot gold rose 0.8% to $4,621.92 an ounce as of 10:25 a.m. in Singapore. Silver added 3.2% to $89.7457, while platinum and palladium also advanced. The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was flat after rising 0.2% on Tuesday.",

The white metal advanced as much as 3.5 % to touch $ 89.9965 an ounce while gold traded near an alltime peak . Underlying inflation in December was not_as high as feared although economists said the data was artificially depressed by the recordlong government shutdown late last year . Precious metals have made a strong start to 2026 after blistering rallies last year with the prospect of a criminal indictment against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reviving worries about the monetary authority ’ s independence . Central bankers across the world have rallied behind Powell and JPMorgan Chase Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the political intervention could backfire . Haven demand has also been aided by US President Donald Trump ’ s capture of Venezuela ’ s leader his renewed threats to take Greenland and violent protests in Iran that could lead to a toppling of the Islamic regime there . Citigroup Inc. analysts upgraded their forecasts this week for gold and silver to $ 5000 per ounce and $ 100 an ounce respectively in the next three months . Silver outperformed gold last year surging almost 150 % thanks to a short squeeze in October and persistent supply tightness in London .

      "selftext": "I bring this up due to the recent mentions of a drug patent cliff mentioned by CNBC, Globe and Mail, and Brownstone Research that will affect many of the big pharmaceutical companies. Is this as concerning for them as it's made out to be or is it just noise? There was a surge in biotech during covid, but that was because of covid. This one is more related to loss of profits. If it is as detrimental as it sounds then what companies do you guys think would benefit from this? Im not very familiar in what big pharma looks for when acquiring small cap biotech, but I've seen mentions of investments in oncology and weightloss drugs. Sellas is the name that's been hyped on this past month and I found it to be a coincidence that they're gearing up to be a solid buy out candidate at the same time the patent cliff is about to hit. I only mention sellas because they're one of the few biotechs that legitimately feels like they can execute based on the past trial data and current ongoing trial. I used them as a frame of reference, however, that's not the point. I want to know if there is a legitimate benefit for microcaps or small caps from the upcoming patent cliff. What're your picks if you do expect a cliff and just give a quick summary about the drug as well. Late-stage picks would make the most sense, early or mid stage isn't even in contention because of how unpredictable they are.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro, Interactive Brokers, Trading212, etc., with people reporting things like: - accounts being frozen or closed; - slow or unresponsive customer service; - difficulty withdrawing funds; - limited explanations during “reviews”. As a long-term retail investor, this honestly makes me uneasy. Many of us are investing years of savings, trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades. I’m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases, compliance issues, and I’d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors. Some genuine questions I have: What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account? How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked? Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice? - What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk? (multiple brokers, record-keeping, etc.) I’m not trying to bash any broker, just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages. Would love to hear: Personal experiences good or bad; Insights from people who’ve dealt with compliance reviews; Views from anyone with legal, regulatory, or professional investing background. Let’s keep it constructive, I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don’t always ask. Thanks in advance",

I just keep selling my calls before I should because I see my gains go down a slight amount. Maybe I should stay off my phone but I primarily do weeklies (cause I’m well regarded) and my most recent plays I could’ve 4-5x’d but instead I sold them for a 20-80% gain. For example, I bought AMD 6 205 calls at 4.15 on Friday and all the J Powell news came out I thought I was gonna be -50% on open. Open happens and I exit +300 dollars on a 2k gamble. Come today it hit 222 and the call is currently selling for 4x. And this is not even the first time this has happened. I have sold way too early on last week’s micron calls in which I could have also 4x’d. I had puts on the random day that Trump dropped the market with tariff news and sold for +200% when if I held I could’ve sold them for around +2000%. So just wondering, do I need to hold longer or am I just not made out for dailies/weeklies and should just do leaps. Anyone else in a similar situation or am I just the stupid one getting correct timings but incorrect exits? I have screenshots if anyone wants proof as well",

Maybe I should stay off my phone but I primarily do weeklies cause I ’ m well regarded and my most recent plays I could ’ ve 45x ’ d but instead I sold them for a 2080 % gain . For example I bought AMD 6 205 calls at 4.15 on Friday and all the J Powell news came out I thought I was gon na be 50 % on open . Open happens and I exit 300 dollars on a 2k gamble . Come today it hit 222 and the call is currently selling for 4x . And this is not_even the first time this has happened . I have sold way too early on last week ’ s micron calls in which I could have also 4x ’ d . I had puts on the random day that Trump dropped the market with tariff news and sold for 200 % when if I held I could ’ ve sold them for around 2000 % . So just wondering do I need to hold longer or am I just not_made out for dailiesweeklies and should just do leaps . Anyone else in a similar situation or am I just the stupid one getting correct timings but incorrect exits I have screenshots if anyone wants proof as well"

      "selftext": "Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports. \"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\" The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts. The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use. \"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said. Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars. \"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. Tapped into USV industry. Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro. 1,800% YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long.",

      "selftext_processed": "Secretary of Defense Hegseth ’ s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no_brainer . The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies . It also assigns to combat units authority to buy test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes according to reports . While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape Hegseth said in the video online . Not anymore . The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by approving hundreds of American products for military purchase . It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry . The DOD plans to arm combat units with a variety of lowcost drones made by American engineers and AI experts . The order will also expand the Blue List of DODapproved unmanned drones components and software as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency according to reports . The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use . Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops the memo said . Lastly the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year which includes forceonforce drone wars . Lethality will not_be hindered by selfimposed restrictions especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue Hegseth wrote in the memo . The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones part of the SRR contract which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . Following news today RedCat ’ s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat ’ s drones . They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . There is also speculation that RedCat ’ s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its antijamming technology . They are also tapping in the USV which I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones . Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia Yup . RedCat . TLDR Drone warfare is here . American drone dominance is here . Plan to outpace China which means $ $ $ $ $ for drone industry . RedCat won SRR contract beating 30 competitors for it . Meeting the supply demand for the contract . Has connections to current administration . Approved for NATO . Tapped into USV industry . Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro . 1800 % YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long ."

Not that it prevented them from falling or failing, but at least there was more structure to that. So… I'm not implying that “**stocks are dead**” as I'm quite invested in that. Just wondering if we’re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature. * Are stocks **still** “the best” because they’re inherently superior, or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat? * Do future returns look anything like the past? * Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not repeat so similarly? * Where does Crypto sit in this equation?

      "selftext": "At first glance, news of a criminal probe involving the Fed Chair sounds like something that should shake markets. Yet equities have barely reacted. One reason is that markets care more about policy than personalities. Investors are focused on interest rates, liquidity, and inflation trends, not headlines, unless those headlines threaten a shift in monetary policy. Another factor is institutional continuity. The Federal Reserve doesn’t hinge on one individual. Even if investigations make noise, markets assume the Fed’s policy framework and decision making process remain intact. As long as rate expectations and economic data don’t change, risk assets tend to stay supported. In short, the market is signaling confidence that the probe won’t disrupt monetary policy or financial stability. Until that assumption changes, traders are likely to keep prioritizing earnings, inflation data, and rate cut timing over political or legal drama.",

In the 2024 BRK shareholder's meeting, the last question was on a codicil that Charlie Munger had included in his will. I have never really found any information on it online though. I was just wondering if some of you had other such anecdotes that might not make it to the main press discussions/writings to share.

In it he mentions how he got to know that Warren Buffett watches who buys and sells the A shares for Berkshire . In the 2024 BRK shareholders meeting the last question was on a codicil that Charlie Munger had included in his will . I have never_really found any information on it online though . I was just wondering if some of you had other such anecdotes that might not_make it to the main press discussionswritings to share . Not_just looking for those on Warren and Charlie but generally for some of the personalities you might have interacted with or learnt from in the past ."

      "selftext": "Alphabet briefly crossed a $4 trillion market cap following news of its AI partnership with Apple. The deal puts Google’s Gemini models directly into Apple’s ecosystem, which is a pretty significant distribution win given Apple’s user base. From a stock perspective, I’m curious how much of this is already priced in. Alphabet has been on a strong run over the past year, driven by AI optimism, ad recovery, and cloud growth. At $4T, expectations are obviously very high. Some things I’m thinking about: * Does this partnership materially change Alphabet’s long-term revenue outlook, or is it more strategic positioning? * Is this mainly a sentiment boost, or could it lead to measurable earnings impact? * At this valuation, do you see Alphabet as still investable, or more of a hold from here?

I believe that with years of trading experience, there’s a lot of wisdom and unique perspectives to share, and I’m eager to exchange ideas and learn from others. A little about myself: I’m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while. About 50% of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks, but I also like to experiment with growth stocks, tech stocks, and even some small-cap stocks (I know it’s quite aggressive for me, but I keep it within what I’m comfortable with). I’m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we’re bullish on. And if we happen to be in the same city, grabbing a drink together would be a great option too!",

      "title": "PayPal sentiment on this site is purely emotional",
      "selftext": "I understand this has been talked about ad-nauseam and I’m sorry to continue to perpetuate the discussion. However, after reading through a number of threads on PayPal, the sentiment towards the company seems purely emotional and vibe based and completely detached from the companies operational metrics. Every comment is something in the vein of - PayPal has no moat - Nobody uses PayPal - PayPal is in terminal decline None of this is operationally true. And I’m wondering if anyone expressing this sentiment has actually dug into the company, or if they’re just being purely emotional based on what they perceive and not what’s evident. Rather than being in terminal decline, PayPal has just shifted from new user growth to better monetisation of its existing 438 million users and 36 million merchants. Revenue reached $8.4 billion (up 7%), with particularly strong international performance at $3.66 billion (up 10%). Transaction margins expanded 6% to $3.9 billion, while operating income grew 9%. 32% increase in GAAP EPS to $1.30, driven by cost control and share buybacks. Operating margins of 18.1% and total payment volume of $458.1 billion (up 8%). Forward P/E ratio of around 11. Free cash flow yield of 8-10%. Projected EPS growth of 11% over the next 5 years. $6-7 billion in annual free cash flow, providing a cash yield of 10-11% based on current market capitalization. The balance sheet shows $17.3 billion in cash and investments against only $11.3 billion in debt, resulting in $6 billion in net cash. Under the conservative assumptions of continued 5-6% revenue growth, fair value sits around $100 per share In addition they have a powerful driver of shareholder appreciation and they committed $6 billion allocated to repurchases in 2025. With the depressed levels, the company can retire approximately 11% of outstanding shares in a single year. This creates a mathematical floor: even if total profit remains flat, reducing share count by 11% automatically boosts earnings per share by 12%. As long as the stock remains undervalued, these buybacks become increasingly effective, transforming what everyone is calling a value trap into a high-probability value play with multiple paths to significant returns. In terms of the actually company strategy, they have shifted focus on solving high-value problems in the payments ecosystem. Their new product Fastlane, leverages the company's database of 438 million users to recognize customers at checkout and autofill their information with a simple verification code. Early results show Fastlane increases checkout conversion rates by 50% and reduces checkout time by 32%. For smaller businesses, PayPal Complete Payments (PPCP) bundles branded checkout and card processing into a single platform that competes directly with Stripe and Shopify. PPCP is experiencing double-digit growth in the US, UK, and Germany While Venmo's user count has plateaued as most young U.S. adults already use the app, revenue grew 20% year-over-year in mid-2025. Which far outpaces user growth and proves the company can extract substantially more value from its existing base. This monetization stems from three key drivers: Venmo Debit Card users grew 40% and are six times more active than peer-to-peer-only users; \"Pay with Venmo\" merchant payment volume grew over 50%, generating lucrative merchant fees; and integrations with major retailers like Amazon have made Venmo a standard checkout option. With $325 billion in annual payment volume flowing through the platform, even marginal improvements in monetization rates translate to hundreds of millions in high-margin incremental profit. The narrative that Apple Pay will destroy PayPal significantly overstates the threat. While Apple Pay dominates in-person mobile payments, PayPal still has 45% market share in global online processing which is a larger and faster-growing segment. Unlike Apple Pay, which only functions on Apple devices, PayPal works across all platforms: Android, Windows, and iOS. Merchants prefer PayPal because it shares customer data useful for marketing and fraud prevention, while Apple maintains strict privacy controls that limit merchant insights. For consumers purchasing from unfamiliar merchants, PayPal's Buyer Protection program provides transaction insurance and dispute resolution that standard digital wallets don't offer, creating trust that directly increases conversion rates. PayPal is successfully holding its own against fintech darlings like Adyen and Stripe. Its Braintree subsidiary maintains steady growth through competitive pricing and modern technology. The recent partnership placing Fastlane technology into Adyen's platform demonstrates that even competitors recognize PayPal's unique strengths in conversion optimization. Management has deliberately prioritized quality over quantity. While total accounts have stabilized at 438 million after eliminating incentive-driven low-quality sign-ups, transactions per active account increased 5%, indicating deeper engagement from core users. All of this data completely refutes the dying company narrative. PayPal exhibits every characteristic of a mature, healthy blue-chip technology company The business generates over $6 billion in annual free cash flow and management is deploying that capital effectively through strategic buybacks that increase per-share value. Despite critics' claims, both revenue and earnings are growing steadily. A valuation of 11.5x forward earnings implies imminent disaster, yet financial statements show a stable, increasingly efficient operation. Even using conservative assumptions, intrinsic value ranges from $98-100 per share, representing approximately 70% upside from current levels. PayPal stands as a clear example of a fundamentally sound, profitable business that the market has dramatically mispriced due to emotional bearish sentiment disconnected from operational reality.",

      "selftext_processed": "I understand this has been talked about adnauseam and I ’ m sorry to continue to perpetuate the discussion . However after reading through a number of threads on PayPal the sentiment towards the company seems purely emotional and vibe based and completely detached from the companies operational metrics . Every comment is something in the vein of PayPal has no_moat Nobody_uses PayPal PayPal is in terminal decline None of this is operationally true . And I ’ m wondering if anyone expressing this sentiment has actually dug into the company or if they ’ re just being purely emotional based on what they perceive and not_what ’ s evident . Rather than being in terminal decline PayPal has just shifted from new user growth to better monetisation of its existing 438 million users and 36 million merchants . Revenue reached $ 8.4 billion up 7 % with particularly strong international performance at $ 3.66 billion up 10 % . Transaction margins expanded 6 % to $ 3.9 billion while operating income grew 9 % . 32 % increase in GAAP EPS to $ 1.30 driven by cost control and share buybacks . Operating margins of 18.1 % and total payment volume of $ 458.1 billion up 8 % . Forward PE ratio of around 11 . Free cash flow yield of 810 % . Projected EPS growth of 11 % over the next 5 years . $ 67 billion in annual free cash flow providing a cash yield of 1011 % based on current market capitalization . The balance sheet shows $ 17.3 billion in cash and investments against only $ 11.3 billion in debt resulting in $ 6 billion in net cash . Under the conservative assumptions of continued 56 % revenue growth fair value sits around $ 100 per share In addition they have a powerful driver of shareholder appreciation and they committed $ 6 billion allocated to repurchases in 2025 . With the depressed levels the company can retire approximately 11 % of outstanding shares in a single year . This creates a mathematical floor even if total profit remains flat reducing share count by 11 % automatically boosts earnings per share by 12 % . As long as the stock remains undervalued these buybacks become increasingly effective transforming what everyone is calling a value trap into a highprobability value play with multiple paths to significant returns . In terms of the actually company strategy they have shifted focus on solving highvalue problems in the payments ecosystem . Their new product Fastlane leverages the companys database of 438 million users to recognize customers at checkout and autofill their information with a simple verification code . Early results show Fastlane increases checkout conversion rates by 50 % and reduces checkout time by 32 % . For smaller businesses PayPal Complete Payments PPCP bundles branded checkout and card processing into a single platform that competes directly with Stripe and Shopify . PPCP is experiencing doubledigit growth in the US UK and Germany While Venmos user count has plateaued as most young U.S. adults already use the app revenue grew 20 % yearoveryear in mid2025 . Which far outpaces user growth and proves the company can extract substantially more value from its existing base . This monetization stems from three key drivers Venmo Debit Card users grew 40 % and are six times more active than peertopeeronly users Pay with Venmo merchant payment volume grew over 50 % generating lucrative merchant fees and integrations with major retailers like Amazon have made Venmo a standard checkout option . With $ 325 billion in annual payment volume flowing through the platform even marginal improvements in monetization rates translate to hundreds of millions in highmargin incremental profit . The narrative that Apple Pay will destroy PayPal significantly overstates the threat . While Apple Pay dominates inperson mobile payments PayPal still has 45 % market share in global online processing which is a larger and fastergrowing segment . Unlike Apple Pay which only functions on Apple devices PayPal works across all platforms Android Windows and iOS . Merchants prefer PayPal because it shares customer data useful for marketing and fraud prevention while Apple maintains strict privacy controls that limit merchant insights . For consumers purchasing from unfamiliar merchants PayPals Buyer Protection program provides transaction insurance and dispute resolution that standard digital wallets dont offer creating trust that directly increases conversion rates . PayPal is successfully holding its own against fintech darlings like Adyen and Stripe . Its Braintree subsidiary maintains steady growth through competitive pricing and modern technology . The recent partnership placing Fastlane technology into Adyens platform demonstrates that even competitors recognize PayPals unique strengths in conversion optimization . Management has deliberately prioritized quality over quantity . While total accounts have stabilized at 438 million after eliminating incentivedriven lowquality signups transactions per active account increased 5 % indicating deeper engagement from core users . All of this data completely refutes the dying company narrative . PayPal exhibits every characteristic of a mature healthy bluechip technology company The business generates over $ 6 billion in annual free cash flow and management is deploying that capital effectively through strategic buybacks that increase pershare value . Despite critics claims both revenue and earnings are growing steadily . A valuation of 11.5x forward earnings implies imminent disaster yet financial statements show a stable increasingly efficient operation . Even using conservative assumptions intrinsic value ranges from $ 98100 per share representing approximately 70 % upside from current levels . PayPal stands as a clear example of a fundamentally sound profitable business that the market has dramatically mispriced due to emotional bearish sentiment disconnected from operational reality ."

      "selftext": "Hi, I recently got a new job and will be transferring my old 401k into an IRA in Fidelity to reduce management fees. Based on some quick research, here is roughly what I’m thinking but would love to hear feedback / advice. Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no or little management fees: 50% FZROX (basically VOO but no fees?) 20% FZILX (international emerging markets with no fees) 20% FTEC (fidelity tech etf) 10% FESM (fidelity small cap) What are your thoughts on this? And since I will start with all cash, do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period? It’s roughly 70k USD. Thank you in advance",

Based on some quick research here is roughly what I ’ m thinking but would love to hear feedback advice . Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no_or little management fees 50 % FZROX basically VOO but no_fees 20 % FZILX international emerging markets with no_fees 20 % FTEC fidelity tech etf 10 % FESM fidelity small cap What are your thoughts on this And since I will start with all cash do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period It ’ s roughly 70k USD . Thank you in advance"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, Here's a look at my strategy. I'll admit, I'm not a huge precious metals guy.I've got a few ounces of gold I've held for over a decade, some silver coins from when I was a kid, and that's about it.But it's been astonishing to see how much they've risen. Precious Metals: Still a Good Bet? Gold hit $4,300, silver almost $70. It's been a great year for them. And a lot of you have been asking about silver. Here's my take: there are good reasons for it to go higher. Industrial demand for solar and EVs is real, there's a supply deficit, and people are looking for alternatives to stocks. It's a perfect storm. But here's the thing: even with this run-up, silver is still below its 1980 peak if you adjust for inflation. That would put it closer to $150-$200 today. So maybe there's still room to grow. The gold-to-silver ratio also suggests silver might be undervalued. But long term? I'm still more optimistic about stocks. Precious metals are great for short bursts, but I don't see them as a long-term wealth builder in the same way. My \"Peace of Mind\" Strategy: 20% in Treasuries This is probably the most important part of my strategy. I keep about 20% of my portfolio in a mix of tax-free municipal bonds and treasuries, earning anywhere from 3.5% to 5.3%. This gives me a ton of peace of mind. If the market falls, I have cash to buy in. If it keeps going higher, that's fine too, because I'm getting monthly income. In hindsight, yeah, I would have made more money just putting it all in the S&P 500. But I put a heavy price on stability. I'm at a point where I'm playing not to lose, not necessarily to maximize every single dollar. Bitcoin: My 10-15% Gamble I allocate about 10-15% of my portfolio to a Bitcoin ETF. This is an amount I'm willing to risk. If it goes to zero, so be it. But long term, I'm optimistic. I have no doubt the Fed will just keep printing more money, and people will be looking for a digital store of value. As long as I'm not holding on to dollars, I'm happy. My Outlook for 2026: Lower, Choppier Returns So what do I think about 2026? Generally, I do worry that AI valuations are getting a bit out of hand. It seems a bit frothy. But that's not stopping me from buying in. Who knows what's going to happen? I'm not going to try to time the market. The general consensus seems to be that we're not likely to see one asset class explode in price, but instead, we're probably entering a time of lower, choppier returns. More volatility, fewer easy wins. My Unchanging Strategy So whether this year turns into the next generational buying opportunity or the one that tests everyone's patience, my strategy is going to be the exact same: Keep buying in consistently. Diversify through index funds. Don't panic when the market drops. At the end of the day, the future is likely going to reward consistency, patience, and discipline. Markets tend to punish people who chase headlines, overleverage, and try to outsmart everyone else. The easiest way to come out ahead is to just keep it simple. What are your thoughts? How are you positioning for 2026? Let's discuss.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone Heres a look at my strategy . Ill admit Im not_a huge precious metals guy.Ive got a few ounces of gold Ive held for over a decade some silver coins from when I was a kid and thats about it.But its been astonishing to see how much theyve risen . Precious Metals Still a Good Bet Gold hit $ 4300 silver almost $ 70 . Its been a great year for them . And a lot of you have been asking about silver . Heres my take there are good reasons for it to go higher . Industrial demand for solar and EVs is real theres a supply deficit and people are looking for alternatives to stocks . Its a perfect storm . But heres the thing even with this runup silver is still below its 1980 peak if you adjust for inflation . That would put it closer to $ 150 $ 200 today . So maybe theres still room to grow . The goldtosilver ratio also suggests silver might be undervalued . But long term Im still more optimistic about stocks . Precious metals are great for short bursts but I dont see them as a longterm wealth builder in the same way . My Peace of Mind Strategy 20 % in Treasuries This is probably the most important part of my strategy . I keep about 20 % of my portfolio in a mix of taxfree municipal bonds and treasuries earning anywhere from 3.5 % to 5.3 % . This gives me a ton of peace of mind . If the market falls I have cash to buy in . If it keeps going higher thats fine too because Im getting monthly income . In hindsight yeah I would have made more money just putting it all in the SP 500 . But I put a heavy price on stability . Im at a point where Im playing not_to lose not_necessarily to maximize every single dollar . Bitcoin My 1015 % Gamble I allocate about 1015 % of my portfolio to a Bitcoin ETF . This is an amount Im willing to risk . If it goes to zero so be it . But long term Im optimistic . I have no_doubt the Fed will just keep printing more money and people will be looking for a digital store of value . As long as Im not_holding on to dollars Im happy . My Outlook for 2026 Lower Choppier Returns So what do I think about 2026 Generally I do worry that AI valuations are getting a bit out of hand . It seems a bit frothy . But thats not_stopping me from buying in . Who knows whats going to happen Im not_going to try to time the market . The general consensus seems to be that were not_likely to see one asset class explode in price but instead were probably entering a time of lower choppier returns . More volatility fewer easy wins . My Unchanging Strategy So whether this year turns into the next generational buying opportunity or the one that tests everyones patience my strategy is going to be the exact same Keep buying in consistently . Diversify through index funds . Dont panic when the market drops . At the end of the day the future is likely going to reward consistency patience and discipline . Markets tend to punish people who chase headlines overleverage and try to outsmart everyone else . The easiest way to come out ahead is to just keep it simple . What are your thoughts How are you positioning for 2026 Lets discuss ."

      "selftext": "Just dumped £100 into the most mentioned/favourited stocks from [this post]( I went through the comments and tried adjusting the weights based on number of mentions / number of upvotes. Don't think about it too much. Depending how my finances are this year I might dump in £100 every month as a DCA so it's at least over £1k across the year to make it more interesting. I'm not planning on rebalancing as I'd prefer to double down on the winners since I expect some of this will probably go to 0. This list is: * NBIS – Nebius Group NV - 10% * KRKNF – Kraken Robotics - 10% * ASX – ASE Technology - 8% * AMD – Advanced Micro Devices - 6% * FSLR – First Solar - 6% * EOSE – Eos Energy Enterprises - 6% * SLS – SELLAS Life Sciences - 6% * CLS – Celestica - 6% * MU – Micron Technology - 5% * ONDS – Ondas - 5% * PL – Planet Labs - 5% * IREN – IREN - 5% * LUNR – Intuitive Machines - 5% * APLD – Applied Digital - 5% * AMPX – Amprius Technologies - 5% * RZLV – Rezolve AI - 4% * SMR – NuScale Power - 3% Since I'm in the UK I'm using £ and therefore currency exchange does apply. I have made this into a [pie]( on Trading 212 for those in Europe and interested or those stupid enough to join. This is not something I expect to go particularly well and not something I would recommend. I understand this is very very dumb, but I figure it'd be fun to look back on this in 12 months time as I love looking at whacky trading strategies. [Edited to add] I've already got investments in ASTS which is why I haven't bothered with that",

Dont think about it too much . Depending how my finances are this year I might dump in £100 every month as a DCA so its at least over £1k across the year to make it more interesting . Im not_planning on rebalancing as Id prefer to double down on the winners since I expect some of this will probably go to 0 . This list is NBIS – Nebius Group NV 10 % KRKNF – Kraken Robotics 10 % ASX – ASE Technology 8 % AMD – Advanced Micro Devices 6 % FSLR – First Solar 6 % EOSE – Eos Energy Enterprises 6 % SLS – SELLAS Life Sciences 6 % CLS – Celestica 6 % MU – Micron Technology 5 % ONDS – Ondas 5 % PL – Planet Labs 5 % IREN – IREN 5 % LUNR – Intuitive Machines 5 % APLD – Applied Digital 5 % AMPX – Amprius Technologies 5 % RZLV – Rezolve AI 4 % SMR – NuScale Power 3 % Since Im in the UK Im using £ and therefore currency exchange does apply . I have made this into a pie on Trading 212 for those in Europe and interested or those stupid enough to join . This is not_something I expect to go particularly well and not_something I would recommend . I understand this is very very dumb but I figure itd be fun to look back on this in 12 months time as I love looking at whacky trading strategies . Edited to add Ive already got investments in ASTS which is why I havent bothered with that"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I've been trying to make sense of the absolute chaos that was 2025, and it's a wild ride. If you feel like the world got turned upside down, you're not wrong. It basically comes down to this: Trump went after everyone with tariffs, and the rest of the world is still trying to figure out where to stand. Remember Trump's first trade war? This is 2.0, and it's on steroids. This wasn't just about China anymore. Trump basically hit the entire world with a 10% \"universal tariff\" on April 5th. Then he rolled out the \"reciprocal tariffs,\" and the numbers were just insane: China: 34% EU: 20% Japan: 24% India: 26% He called it \"Liberation Day.\" Seriously. The markets, of course, completely freaked out. Stocks, bonds, everything tanked. It got so bad the government had to hit pause for 90 days and tell everyone, \"Okay, okay, let's talk.\" So what was the point? Officially, it was about the trade deficit. But come on. We all know that's just for show. The real goal was to get leverage. To force everyone to the negotiating table and rewrite the rules. It was a political power play, not an economic one. How did the world react? Everyone scrambled. It was a mad dash to cut a deal. China fought back hard at first, threatening tariffs over 100%, but eventually they agreed to a temporary truce, buy more soybeans, crack down on fentanyl, and the US would pause the extra tariffs. The EU was a mess. They were pissed, but totally divided. Germany was terrified about the 25% auto tariff, while France was more worried about its farmers. They ended up caving for a 15% tariff (including on cars), but it cost them. They had to promise to buy $750 billion in US energy and invest another $600 billion. Ouch. Japan and South Korea just threw money at the problem. They basically said, \"How much investment do you want?\" Japan pledged $550 billion, South Korea $350 billion. And poof, their tariffs dropped to 15%. India, though, played hardball. They barely budged. So Trump hit them with an extra 25% penalty for buying Russian oil. Now they're at 50% and still arguing. So now we have this weird tiered system where the UK gets a 10% \"buddy\" discount, the EU and Japan get a 15% \"frenemy\" rate, and China and India are in the 25%+ penalty box. The US economy is... fine? But it's weird. With all this going on, you'd think the US economy would be a dumpster fire. But it's just... okay. Growth is around 2%, inflation is 2.7%. It's boring. But \"boring\" is a huge win right now. But here's the weird part. The US dollar is shaky, and government debt is at a mind\u0002boggling $38 trillion. The thing propping it all up seems to be AI. Tech giants are pouring insane money into AI,over $300 billion in capital expenditure from just four companies. But here's the kicker: it's not creating jobs. In fact, AI industries are seeing employment drop. It's a capital boom, not a jobs boom. Am I the only one who finds that terrifying? We're living in a fractured world now. All this has completely changed the game. It's not about \"make it where it's cheapest\" anymore. Now it's about \"make it where it's safest.\" The old system of global rules (the WTO is basically a ghost at this point) is being replaced by a system of political deals and power plays. It feels like everything is splitting apart, countries, industries, even the gap between the rich and poor seems to be getting wider. It's a whole new ballgame, and I don't think anyone knows the rules yet. What do you guys think? Is this just a temporary mess, or is this the new normal? Are we heading for more instability? Let's discuss.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone Ive been trying to make sense of the absolute chaos that was 2025 and its a wild ride . If you feel like the world got turned upside down youre not_wrong . It basically comes down to this Trump went after everyone with tariffs and the rest of the world is still trying to figure out where to stand . Remember Trumps first trade war This is 2.0 and its on steroids . This wasnt just about China anymore . Trump basically hit the entire world with a 10 % universal tariff on April 5th . Then he rolled out the reciprocal tariffs and the numbers were just insane China 34 % EU 20 % Japan 24 % India 26 % He called it Liberation Day . Seriously . The markets of course completely freaked out . Stocks bonds everything tanked . It got so bad the government had to hit pause for 90 days and tell everyone Okay okay lets talk . So what was the point Officially it was about the trade deficit . But come on . We all know thats just for show . The real goal was to get leverage . To force everyone to the negotiating table and rewrite the rules . It was a political power play not_an economic one . How did the world react Everyone scrambled . It was a mad dash to cut a deal . China fought back hard at first threatening tariffs over 100 % but eventually they agreed to a temporary truce buy more soybeans crack down on fentanyl and the US would pause the extra tariffs . The EU was a mess . They were pissed but totally divided . Germany was terrified about the 25 % auto tariff while France was more worried about its farmers . They ended up caving for a 15 % tariff including on cars but it cost them . They had to promise to buy $ 750 billion in US energy and invest another $ 600 billion . Ouch . Japan and South Korea just threw money at the problem . They basically said How much investment do you want Japan pledged $ 550 billion South Korea $ 350 billion . And poof their tariffs dropped to 15 % . India though played hardball . They barely budged . So Trump hit them with an extra 25 % penalty for buying Russian oil . Now theyre at 50 % and still arguing . So now we have this weird tiered system where the UK gets a 10 % buddy discount the EU and Japan get a 15 % frenemy rate and China and India are in the 25 % penalty box . The US economy is ... fine But its weird . With all this going on youd think the US economy would be a dumpster fire . But its just ... okay . Growth is around 2 % inflation is 2.7 % . Its boring . But boring is a huge win right now . But heres the weird part . The US dollar is shaky and government debt is at a mind\u0002boggling $ 38 trillion . The thing propping it all up seems to be AI . Tech giants are pouring insane money into AIover $ 300 billion in capital expenditure from just four companies . But heres the kicker its not_creating jobs . In fact AI industries are seeing employment drop . Its a capital boom not_a jobs boom . Am I the only one who finds that terrifying Were living in a fractured world now . All this has completely changed the game . Its not_about make it where its cheapest anymore . Now its about make it where its safest . The old system of global rules the WTO is basically a ghost at this point is being replaced by a system of political deals and power plays . It feels like everything is splitting apart countries industries even the gap between the rich and poor seems to be getting wider . Its a whole new ballgame and I dont think anyone knows the rules yet . What do you guys think Is this just a temporary mess or is this the new normal Are we heading for more instability Lets discuss ."

      "selftext": "Hello, Investors: I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soon-to-be-born daughter's college fund, and \"retirement\" funds for my wife and me. All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers (no options, futures, forex or crypto), which has been very successful for me. But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market (income), and not a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth (savings). My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 (for college fund) to 30 (for \"retirement\" fund) years. I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets, and long-term family planning. Currently I am torn between VT and VTI. Do you have any opinion on either ETF? Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with, and any experience you have had with a similar plan. Also, please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here. I don't want to fall into a trap just because I don't know what I don't know. NOTE: I am not seeking any *advice*. I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day.",

      "selftext": "Everyone is chasing their tails over Hyundai, Nvidia, and Tesla, but SoftBank ($SFTBY) is sitting in the perfect spot for a massive breakout. Here is the lowdown on why I'm loading up at **$13.85**. # They still own the \"Cool\" part of Boston Dynamics Hyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a **20% stake**. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke. # They have \"Skin in the Game\" everywhere Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren't just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack. # The Price is a Steal $SFTBY is trading around **$14**, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It’s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat. # They’re back on \"Offense\" Masa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the \"AI re-rating\" this year. # The Bottom Line If you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It’s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell. **DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but I’m adding small here.**",

At CES 2026 the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for realworld work . If Boston Dynamics goes public that 20 % stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke . They have Skin in the Game everywhere Through the Vision Fund SoftBank has built an AI empire . They arent just betting on one horse they own the whole track . From the chips ARM to the brains OpenAI to the muscle Robotics they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack . The Price is a Steal $ SFTBY is trading around $ 14 down from its highs of $ 20 . While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection SoftBank is trading at a massive discount . It ’ s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat . They ’ re back on Offense Masa Son the CEO recently signaled they are done playing defense . With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the AI rerating this year .

      "title": "Why Silver's 150% Rally Looks Exactly Like the 1979 Bubble",
      "selftext": "Okay, so I've been looking at silver prices and... this is getting ridiculous. 150% in one year? I've literally seen this movie before. And it didn't end well. Let me back up. If you asked me at the start of 2025 what the best-performing asset would be, I would've been completely wrong. Silver. Nobody calls silver. It crushed gold (66% gain), it crushed the Nasdaq (21% gain), it crushed everything. But here's the thing:this kind of move is rare. And when I say rare, I mean it's happened like twice in modern history. Both times ended in disaster. The Hunt Brothers: The Original Silver Disaster So back in the 1970s, these two oil-rich brothers(the Hunts)decided they were going to corner the silver market. I'm not making this up. They literally thought they could control the entire market. They started buying physical silver. Price went from $3 to $5. Okay, nice. But then they got greedy. In 1978, they stopped buying the actual metal and started loading up on futures with massive leverage. The price went absolutely insane. From $6 to $50 in like two years. A 700% gain. These guys were printing money. Then came March 1980. The regulators basically said \"nope.\" The New York Mercantile Exchange hiked margin requirements from 10% to 50%. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange straight up banned new long positions. The leverage was gone. Just like that. What happened next? Three weeks. That's all it took. Silver crashed from $50 back down to $13. The Hunt brothers lost over a billion dollars. They went bankrupt. Game over. Here's the lesson: When you build a rally on leverage and speculation, regulators can kill it overnight. 2011: The Sequel Fast forward to 2008. Financial crisis. Governments everywhere are throwing money at the problem. China's doing a 4 trillion yuan stimulus. And suddenly, there's real industrial demand for silver. Solar panels, electronics, all that stuff needs silver. Silver goes from $9 to $40. This time, it actually makes sense. There's real demand. But then... same story. Speculation takes over. Traders stop caring about industrial demand and start betting on the price going higher. By 2011, we're back near $50. May 2011. Here we go again. The CME Group raises margin requirements five times in eight days. 150% increase total. The leverage gets crushed. Silver crashes from $50 to $25. And later, we find out JPMorgan traders had been manipulating the price. They got fined $920 million. Here's the lesson: Even when a rally starts with real fundamentals, speculation can hijack it. And when it does, it ends the same way. So What's Actually Happening in 2025? Okay, so if supply and demand don't support this rally, what does? Here's where it gets interesting. Gold is up 60%. Investors see gold expensive and look for something cheaper with more upside. Silver fits the bill perfectly. It's like the leveraged play on gold. Trump's tariff bomb. In August, the Trump administration designated silver a \"critical mineral.\" Suddenly, traders are freaking out. They're thinking: \"Tariffs are coming. I need to get silver into the US before the tariffs hit.\" So what do they do? They start shipping silver like crazy from London (the world's main clearing center) to New York. The London squeeze. Here's where it gets weird. All this silver moving from London to New York means London vaults are running dry. But the world still needs physical silver to settle contracts every day. So what happens? Price spikes. And it spikes hard. ETF feedback loop. Rising prices attract money into silver ETFs. But here's the catch is many of these ETFs need to hold physical silver in London as backing. But London's running out! So you get this crazy loop: more ETF demand,need more physical silver,but there's none available,price goes up more ,attracts more ETF money. It's a feedback loop. The short squeeze. Meanwhile, all these rising prices attract short sellers betting on a crash. But they can't find silver to deliver. So they have to borrow it. The cost to borrow silver? It shot up to 35%+. These guys are getting crushed. They're desperate to cover. So you've got this perfect storm: gold spillover, tariff panic, physical shortage, ETF buying,and a short squeeze all happening at once. That's why silver is up 150%. But here's the thing... The Warning Sign Nobody's Talking About There's this metric called the Gold-to-Silver Ratio. It's basically the price of gold divided by the price of silver. Historically, it hangs around 60-70. When it deviates, it snaps back. Right now? It's at 50. That's insane. The last time we saw this was 2011, right before silver got absolutely crushed. Think about what that means. For the ratio to return to normal (say, 65), either gold has to drop or silver has to drop way more than gold. Given that gold has its own fundamentals and silver doesn't, guess which way that goes? Why This Bubble Is Going to Pop Look, the forces holding up silver are temporary. Really temporary. The inventory dislocation will resolve. Traders will eventually stop panicking about tariffs. London's vaults will refill. And don't forget,regulators haven't even stepped in yet. They're just watching. History suggests that when they do, it's going to be ugly. But here's what really gets me. This whole thing is a perfect example of what I call the \"part\u0002to-whole\" mistake. We see one part of a trend working and assume the whole thing works. Gold is rallying? Okay, so silver should rally too. Tesla succeeded? So every EV company should succeed. But that's not how markets work. In precious metals, only gold has sustained value. In EVs, companies like Lucid, Rivian, and Nikola all had massive rallies before crashing back to earth. The market rarely allows multiple winners. Investors who chase these \"spillover\" plays instead of sticking with the proven winners often end up like the Hunt brothers. Even if you're right for a while, the end result can be devastating. So What Now? I could be wrong. Maybe this time is different. Maybe silver has finally found its footing. But honestly? History is screaming at us right now. And the market never seems to listen. What do you guys think? Am I missing something, or does this feel like we're watching a classic bubble inflate?",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so Ive been looking at silver prices and ... this is getting ridiculous . 150 % in one year Ive literally seen this movie before . And it didnt end well . Let me back up . If you asked me at the start of 2025 what the bestperforming asset would be I wouldve been completely wrong . Silver . Nobody_calls silver . It crushed gold 66 % gain it crushed the Nasdaq 21 % gain it crushed everything . But heres the thingthis kind of move is rare . And when I say rare I mean its happened like twice in modern history . Both times ended in disaster . The Hunt Brothers The Original Silver Disaster So back in the 1970s these two oilrich brothersthe Huntsdecided they were going to corner the silver market . Im not_making this up . They literally thought they could control the entire market . They started buying physical silver . Price went from $ 3 to $ 5 . Okay nice . But then they got greedy . In 1978 they stopped buying the actual metal and started loading up on futures with massive leverage . The price went absolutely insane . From $ 6 to $ 50 in like two years . A 700 % gain . These guys were printing money . Then came March 1980 . The regulators basically said nope . The New York Mercantile Exchange hiked margin requirements from 10 % to 50 % . The Chicago Mercantile Exchange straight up banned new long positions . The leverage was gone . Just like that . What happened next Three weeks . Thats all it took . Silver crashed from $ 50 back down to $ 13 . The Hunt brothers lost over a billion dollars . They went bankrupt . Game over . Heres the lesson When you build a rally on leverage and speculation regulators can kill it overnight . 2011 The Sequel Fast forward to 2008 . Financial crisis . Governments everywhere are throwing money at the problem . Chinas doing a 4 trillion yuan stimulus . And suddenly theres real industrial demand for silver . Solar panels electronics all that stuff needs silver . Silver goes from $ 9 to $ 40 . This time it actually makes sense . Theres real demand . But then ... same story . Speculation takes over . Traders stop caring about industrial demand and start betting on the price going higher . By 2011 were back near $ 50 . May 2011 . Here we go again . The CME Group raises margin requirements five times in eight days . 150 % increase total . The leverage gets crushed . Silver crashes from $ 50 to $ 25 . And later we find out JPMorgan traders had been manipulating the price . They got fined $ 920 million . Heres the lesson Even when a rally starts with real fundamentals speculation can hijack it . And when it does it ends the same way . So Whats Actually Happening in 2025 Okay so if supply and demand dont support this rally what does Heres where it gets interesting . Gold is up 60 % . Investors see gold expensive and look for something cheaper with more upside . Silver fits the bill perfectly . Its like the leveraged play on gold . Trumps tariff bomb . In August the Trump administration designated silver a critical mineral . Suddenly traders are freaking out . Theyre thinking Tariffs are coming . I need to get silver into the US before the tariffs hit . So what do they do They start shipping silver like crazy from London the worlds main clearing center to New York . The London squeeze . Heres where it gets weird . All this silver moving from London to New York means London vaults are running dry . But the world still needs physical silver to settle contracts every day . So what happens Price spikes . And it spikes hard . ETF feedback loop . Rising prices attract money into silver ETFs . But heres the catch is many of these ETFs need to hold physical silver in London as backing . But Londons running out So you get this crazy loop more ETF demandneed more physical silverbut theres none availableprice goes up more attracts more ETF money . Its a feedback loop . The short squeeze . Meanwhile all these rising prices attract short sellers betting on a crash . But they cant find silver to deliver . So they have to borrow it . The cost to borrow silver It shot up to 35 % . These guys are getting crushed . Theyre desperate to cover . So youve got this perfect storm gold spillover tariff panic physical shortage ETF buyingand a short squeeze all happening at once . Thats why silver is up 150 % . But heres the thing ... The Warning Sign Nobodys_Talking About Theres this metric called the GoldtoSilver Ratio . Its basically the price of gold divided by the price of silver . Historically it hangs around 6070 . When it deviates it snaps back . Right now Its at 50 . Thats insane . The last time we saw this was 2011 right before silver got absolutely crushed . Think about what that means . For the ratio to return to normal say 65 either gold has to drop or silver has to drop way more than gold . Given that gold has its own fundamentals and silver doesnt guess which way that goes Why This Bubble Is Going to Pop Look the forces holding up silver are temporary . Really temporary . The inventory dislocation will resolve . Traders will eventually stop panicking about tariffs . Londons vaults will refill . And dont forgetregulators havent even stepped in yet . Theyre just watching . History suggests that when they do its going to be ugly . But heres what really gets me . This whole thing is a perfect example of what I call the part\u0002towhole mistake . We see one part of a trend working and assume the whole thing works . Gold is rallying Okay so silver should rally too . Tesla succeeded So every EV company should succeed . But thats not_how markets work . In precious metals only gold has sustained value . In EVs companies like Lucid Rivian and Nikola all had massive rallies before crashing back to earth . The market rarely allows multiple winners . Investors who chase these spillover plays instead of sticking with the proven winners often end up like the Hunt brothers . Even if youre right for a while the end result can be devastating . So What Now I could be wrong . Maybe this time is different . Maybe silver has finally found its footing . But honestly History is screaming at us right now . And the market never_seems to listen . What do you guys think Am I missing something or does this feel like were watching a classic bubble inflate"

      "title": "UBER fears caused by AVs is the same story as Seaech Ai fears was for Google",
      "selftext": "$UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV (Autonomous Vehicle) fears. It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out. If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player. But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets. Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, hell even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. TLDR: AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. [Position: 4 LEAPS, waiting for multiples expansion to take profit]( Yes I know their current P/E of \\~10 is fake due to tax reasons. TLDR: Buy Uber, AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV Autonomous Vehicle fears . It ’ s currently trading at a Forward PE of x25 . The market is pricing $ UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy . I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly fears of search AI taking over Google search . In a similar fashion I believe AV is not_here as Uber ’ s competition rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV ’ s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact . Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together . Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US with 1 city partnering with Lyft 2 with Uber and the remaining 2 with themselves constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out . If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it the upside story looks quite convincing . This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not_end up being a winner take all market rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player . But with the TAM for AVs being so large and the payback period for AVs being so high currently it ’ ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does . I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 3035PE as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets . Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out and Uber is left in the dust with no_partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out so will their gross bookings . However I ’ m not_particularly worried . They ’ ve partnered with Nvidia they ’ ve partnered with Avride Costco even Sephora . Feels like something will stick . Position 4 LEAPS waiting for multiples expansion to take profit Yes I know their current PE of 10 is fake due to tax reasons . TLDR Buy Uber AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor ."

      "selftext": "Obviously both stocks have performed well (Uber up almost 300% from its 2022 trough and Google doubling from its low in the last 12 months). But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there’s clearly a heap of operational momentum there. What I can’t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world? Seems like we’re definitely headed that way. And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders, while the driver provides the car, time, bears the risk, etc. If AV’s displace drivers, and since Uber doesn’t have its own self driving tech, then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed. But in that same world, the developer of that tech (Waymo / Google) would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself (no licensing). I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment, but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app. When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper, safer option (both supported by current data). I’m sure I’m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this.",

      "selftext_processed": "Obviously both stocks have performed well Uber up almost 300 % from its 2022 trough and Google doubling from its low in the last 12 months . But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there ’ s clearly a heap of operational momentum there . What I can ’ t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world Seems like we ’ re definitely headed that way . And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders while the driver provides the car time bears the risk etc . If AV ’ s displace drivers and since Uber doesn ’ t have its own self driving tech then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed . But in that same world the developer of that tech Waymo Google would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself no licensing . I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app . When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper safer option both supported by current data . I ’ m sure I ’ m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this ."

      "selftext": "I burned my graduation money for college and my career. I started trading October of 2023, probably the best time to get in the market before our huge rally’s. I was 18, and had the typical “i can beat the market” mindset. My friend helped me get into it, he only had about a year of experience but was a much safer investor. We both started with 1k, although he shortly added almost his entire savings into it (around 10k). Me being new, thought this was dumb. Meanwhile i spent my 10k into a drain.. We would DD and research stocks. We found stocks like PLTR ($20), RKLB($4), NU($4-6), (I was huge on quantum when it was pennys), NVDA ($40 then), (RDDT), and many more. Example of photo linked My friend would slowly buy shares, not really caring about bears, and or holding through them. He quickly 2x his portfolio within a year. At the time I was working on programming some stock analysis tools, and other projects like algo trading systems. Which took up an unbelievable amount of time. I thought slightly I could “beat the market”. Basically holding stocks for a couple of weeks/months at most. I’m not sure what my friend has made the past few years, but it was enough to afford an apartment at our college. We were planning to go to the same college, which is a bit more pricy. Tbh after losing everything, i’ve decided to play long. But goddamn do I suck at sticking with my guts. I’ve let so many more opportunities, like gold, robotics, etc, slip away from my portfolio from a panic sell, i don’t blame you for calling OP an awful trader. But it was a lesson needed for me to learn. Sometimes it just feels too late on all of my ideas and stocks i’ve had for year. It’s been just brutal watching my $1-$10 shares explode in value. And seeing a dream you/vision you once had slowly fade away but work with someone else is painful. I know 10k isn’t an extreme amount for some people here, but as a college trying to transfer for my degree now, it’s just rough. My buddy has been planning to be a type of financial advisor, and he’s definitely got a golden portfolios to help! My point with this post is try your best to control your emotions, don’t swipe away your shares from fear. And if you’re new/excited, try opening a small account for a longer term strategy! “\"\\*\\*Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful,\\*\\*\"”- \\*The King, Buffet\\*",

      "selftext_processed": "I burned my graduation money for college and my career . I started trading October of 2023 probably the best time to get in the market before our huge rally ’ s . I was 18 and had the typical “ i can beat the market ” mindset . My friend helped me get into it he only had about a year of experience but was a much safer investor . We both started with 1k although he shortly added almost his entire savings into it around 10k . Me being new thought this was dumb . Meanwhile i spent my 10k into a drain .. We would DD and research stocks . We found stocks like PLTR $ 20 RKLB $ 4 NU $ 46 I was huge on quantum when it was pennys NVDA $ 40 then RDDT and many more . Example of photo linked My friend would slowly buy shares not_really caring about bears and or holding through them . He quickly 2x his portfolio within a year . At the time I was working on programming some stock analysis tools and other projects like algo trading systems . Which took up an unbelievable amount of time . I thought slightly I could “ beat the market ” . Basically holding stocks for a couple of weeksmonths at most . I ’ m not_sure what my friend has made the past few years but it was enough to afford an apartment at our college . We were planning to go to the same college which is a bit more pricy . Tbh after losing everything i ’ ve decided to play long . But goddamn do I suck at sticking with my guts . I ’ ve let so many more opportunities like gold robotics etc slip away from my portfolio from a panic sell i don ’ t blame you for calling OP an awful trader . But it was a lesson needed for me to learn . Sometimes it just feels too late on all of my ideas and stocks i ’ ve had for year . It ’ s been just brutal watching my $ 1 $ 10 shares explode in value . And seeing a dream youvision you once had slowly fade away but work with someone else is painful . I know 10k isn ’ t an extreme amount for some people here but as a college trying to transfer for my degree now it ’ s just rough . My buddy has been planning to be a type of financial advisor and he ’ s definitely got a golden portfolios to help My point with this post is try your best to control your emotions don ’ t swipe away your shares from fear . And if you ’ re newexcited try opening a small account for a longer term strategy “ Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful ” The King Buffet"

Just **shiny rock** Fast forward to today and… * **SLV calls:** Printing * **AG calls:** miners decided to wake up and choose violence * **Portfolio:** basically 90% shiny rock derivatives Fiscally responsible? To the point where my portfolio is now just silver, silver accessories, and vibes. I don’t even check fundamentals anymore. If it glitters, I buy calls. If it doesn’t, I don’t understand it. And yet here we are. My investment thesis was simple 1. Inflation bad 2. Shiny rock good 3. Geopolitics complicated, shiny rock simple If Jerome does as much as sneeze again, I’m buying more. Am I selling? ❌ Am I hedging? ❌ Do I know what silver is even made out of? ❌ All I know is my account balance is up so I will be giving unsolicited market advice. If this reverses tomorrow, I will absolutely pretend this was a long-term macro play. **TL;DR:** Bought SLV & AG calls 5 days ago, now my entire personality is silver. Shiny rock supremacy.

Not_some prerevenue penny stock with vibes . Just shiny rock Fast forward to today and… SLV calls Printing AG calls miners decided to wake up and choose violence Portfolio basically 90 % shiny rock derivatives Fiscally responsible To the point where my portfolio is now just silver silver accessories and vibes . I don ’ t even check fundamentals anymore . If it glitters I buy calls . If it doesn ’ t I don ’ t understand it . And yet here we are . My investment thesis was simple 1 . Inflation bad 2 . Shiny rock good 3 . Geopolitics complicated shiny rock simple If Jerome does as much as sneeze again I ’ m buying more . Am I selling ❌ Am I hedging ❌ Do I know what silver is even made out of ❌ All I know is my account balance is up so I will be giving unsolicited market advice . If this reverses tomorrow I will absolutely pretend this was a longterm macro play . TLDR Bought SLV AG calls 5 days ago now my entire personality is silver . Shiny rock supremacy . Either this works or I find out how much Wendy pays an hour . Godspeed brothers ."

      "selftext": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy, but hear me out. Over the past year or so, companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP-1 is the \"#1 savor\" for weight lost. Now, I'm not against the drug and I believe that it is very useful. The process of losing weight is different for everyone, and this drug is great in that sense. However......like with all good things, people find a way to abuse them! There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions. Even on social media (TikTok and others), there are doctors, practicing and non practicing, that are actively/heavily *promoting* some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability. Idc about the logistics of it all, I'm just telling you what I see on my social media feeds. In some weird way, I'm getting opioid crisis/Purdue Pharma/Sackler Family vibes. **No**, there are **no direct parallels** necessarily, but things just seem off about this. I think it's probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse. Also, as we all know with medicine, it usually takes years to hear about major side effects, which is normal. On top of that, I'm sure there are people using it in *creative* ways. Basically, I'm betting for even more significant side effects, lack of adherence and misuse/abuse. This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the stores/pharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make....you know what. But before that, I'm sure sudafed was a free-for-all type of situation. Now on to the investing part...I'm not too sure how to do this. Doing some quick research, and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago. I think it's called shorted/shorting? The only difference is that I don't have billions, so I won't lose billions..haha. I'm thinking of it as something on the side, small amounts of money over a period of time. But I think the same principle still applies, right? Obviously, this isn't a short term thing. But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually, and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way. What are your opinions? How should I start? Overall, do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this? Idk...humans always find a way to abuse things, so i don't feel too crazy for this idea.",

The Good (Why it might pump): \\- Insane Growth: H1 2025 Revenue hit $4.19B (nearly 4x YoY). \\- Real Assets: They hold $90B+ in custody (mostly BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, SUI). \\- Big Backers: Goldman and Citi are leading the deal. The Bad (Why I’m worried): Margins are Dead: Despite 4x revenue, net income dropped to $12.6M. Operating costs are eating them alive. Valuation: Expected 4B-5B. Priced for perfection. My IPO strategy: The quick flip. I’m treating this as a short-term flip, not a long-term hold. I’m treating this purely as a short-term arbitrage, not a long-term hold. \\- Enter: At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave. \\- Exit: If it hits +50% on Day 1, I’m selling. \\- Stop Loss: If it breaks issue price, cut it loose. Verdict: Great narrative (First Custody Stock), but the financials are shaky. I plan to profit from the initial volatility, but I won't be holding this long-term. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Everyone is worried that the Powell investigation will pose an unprecedented challenge to the Fed's independence, and that a credibility crisis could trigger a systemic downgrade in the United States assets , I wanna say, trading stocks from a macro perspective is no different from throwing darts to pick stocks. This shit didn’t prevent $GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today. Clearly, we cannot expect a $4-trillion company to grow by another Doble. However, the deepening of NVIDIA's cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size. Which ONE ? $LLY is indeed the \"king of industrialization\" of AI pharmaceuticals, and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $1 billion, but there will be no surprises if it is already Prcie in, and I won't go to places with a lot of people. $ILMN is indeed a good alternative, it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution, and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider, and its business model is transforming to high-profit software and services, but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in. So, who will be the next target for capital inflow? I belive $RXRX is the best choice. It is not crowded at present, has stopped falling in the low demand zone, and its share price is also reasonable. Once the rotation reaches $RXRX, there is still a chance to double at least. Recursion is Nvidia's \"core ally\" and a direct equity investment in AI-driven pharmaceutical research. Its Recursion OS is a closed-loop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data, which represents its core competitive advantage. Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabyte-scale internal dataset capable of executing AI-driven, closed-loop experiments. Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson, $RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on \"translating biology into search problems,\" aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia. Most importantly, $RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027, and it operates BioHive-2, the industry's most advanced AI supercomputer. I am absolutely committed to supporting $RXRX.",

This shit didn ’ t prevent $ GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today . Clearly we can not expect a $ 4trillion company to grow by another Doble . However the deepening of NVIDIAs cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size . Which ONE $ LLY is indeed the king of industrialization of AI pharmaceuticals and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $ 1 billion but there will be no_surprises if it is already Prcie in and I wont go to places with a lot of people . $ ILMN is indeed a good alternative it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider and its business model is transforming to highprofit software and services but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in . So who will be the next target for capital inflow I belive $ RXRX is the best choice . It is not_crowded at present has stopped falling in the low demand zone and its share price is also reasonable . Once the rotation reaches $ RXRX there is still a chance to double at least . Recursion is Nvidias core ally and a direct equity investment in AIdriven pharmaceutical research . Its Recursion OS is a closedloop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data which represents its core competitive advantage . Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabytescale internal dataset capable of executing AIdriven closedloop experiments . Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson $ RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on translating biology into search problems aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia . Most importantly $ RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027 and it operates BioHive2 the industrys most advanced AI supercomputer . I am absolutely committed to supporting $ RXRX ."

      "selftext": "Right now my 401k is 100% in a 2065 target date fund. The mix is about 90% stocks and 10% bonds. i’m in my early 20s so I know based on my age I should lean towards higher risk which means basically no bonds. My roth ira and personal brokerage is all heavily invested in s&p 500 already. So I was planning on switching my 401k to 100% in s&p 500 but I checked today and was surprised that for 2025, my target date fund actually outperformed s&p 500. This made me consider keeping it in a target date fund although I know I really shouldn’t let one year determine my investment plan. But since I already invest heavily in S&P in my other accounts, would it actually be smart to keep my 401k in a target date fund? Edit: Thanks for the advice. I decided to change to a 70% S&P 500 and 30% international in my 401k. But have a follow up question about whether i should do automatic rebalancing in 401k and how frequent it should happen. Here’s the follow up post",

      "selftext_processed": "Right now my 401k is 100 % in a 2065 target date fund . The mix is about 90 % stocks and 10 % bonds . i ’ m in my early 20s so I know based on my age I should lean towards higher risk which means basically no_bonds . My roth ira and personal brokerage is all heavily invested in sp 500 already . So I was planning on switching my 401k to 100 % in sp 500 but I checked today and was surprised that for 2025 my target date fund actually outperformed sp 500 . This made me consider keeping it in a target date fund although I know I really shouldn ’ t let one year determine my investment plan . But since I already invest heavily in SP in my other accounts would it actually be smart to keep my 401k in a target date fund Edit Thanks for the advice . I decided to change to a 70 % SP 500 and 30 % international in my 401k . But have a follow up question about whether i should do automatic rebalancing in 401k and how frequent it should happen . Here ’ s the follow up post"

      "selftext": "As a long time investor, I realized this year that I often had tens if not hundreds of strong calls or at least \"hunches\" throughout a year. I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to \"rationalize\" away. So this year, I decided to record and publish every \"buy\" in my mind throughout the year, along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision (and timestamp the day of the call). In order to systematize the process, I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly. Winners would be categorized as up more than 5% throughout the period. Neutral picks are within 5% up or down (dead money, or recent calls mainly). Losers were tagged as greater than a 5% loss. All picks (regardless of June or December timestamp) would be equally weighted. An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances. **The Results:** I ended up writing 35 \"calls\" between April and December 2025. Price on the day I published vs today. No edits. No pretending I sold the top. No “would’ve sized this differently.” Just the equal weight returns. Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly **42%**. **Winners/Neutral/Losers** * **Up more than 5%:** **18 / 35 (51%)** * **Neutral (±5%):** **5 / 35 (14%)** * **Down more than 5%:** **12 / 35 (34%)** Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy: Diversification among convicted buys is not optional for stock pickers. Yes, a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out, but some flat out did not and were anchors to the portfolio. Even if you are \"right\" over the long term, you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost, timing matters. Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance. One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come. (even at a 1/35th allocation) **A handful of names did almost all the work.** JMIA (+478%) RKLB (+288%) HOOD (+167%) AMD (+143%) SOFI (+142%). **A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns:** HNST (-52%) BMNR (-49%) COIN (-21%) HIMS (-21%) MELI (-17%) PYPL (-16%) **Another important point of discovery:** Going against the common sentiment in a stock, is right a heck of a lot more than it's wrong. My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year (AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand), Estee Lauder Stock trading as if it's going to file bankruptcy, the death of Google by chatgpt, so on and so forth. **Lastly,** although not being able \"to sell\" certainly cost me real performance over this experiment, it also helped immensely with discipline. Not panic selling long-term convictions over a headline and inversely not selling the first 15% pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times. **Yes,** there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry, but it's often much later than you think. Overall, it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026. Regardless of the returns or bull market luck, I became an immensely better investor throughout the process. Let me know if you have any questions about the process, results, or in general.",

      "selftext_processed": "As a long time investor I realized this year that I often had tens if not_hundreds of strong calls or at least hunches throughout a year . I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to rationalize away . So this year I decided to record and publish every buy in my mind throughout the year along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision and timestamp the day of the call . In order to systematize the process I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly . Winners would be categorized as up more than 5 % throughout the period . Neutral picks are within 5 % up or down dead money or recent calls mainly . Losers were tagged as greater than a 5 % loss . All picks regardless of June or December timestamp would be equally weighted . An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances . The Results I ended up writing 35 calls between April and December 2025 . Price on the day I published vs today . No_edits . No_pretending I sold the top . No_ “ would ’ ve sized this differently. ” Just the equal weight returns . Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly 42 % . WinnersNeutralLosers Up more than 5 % 18 35 51 % Neutral ±5 % 5 35 14 % Down more than 5 % 12 35 34 % Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy Diversification among convicted buys is not_optional for stock pickers . Yes a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out but some flat out did not_and were anchors to the portfolio . Even if you are right over the long term you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost timing matters . Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance . One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come . even at a 135th allocation A handful of names did almost all the work . JMIA 478 % RKLB 288 % HOOD 167 % AMD 143 % SOFI 142 % . A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns HNST 52 % BMNR 49 % COIN 21 % HIMS 21 % MELI 17 % PYPL 16 % Another important point of discovery Going against the common sentiment in a stock is right a heck of a lot more than its wrong . My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand Estee Lauder Stock trading as if its going to file bankruptcy the death of Google by chatgpt so on and so forth . Lastly although not_being able to sell certainly cost me real performance over this experiment it also helped immensely with discipline . Not_panic selling longterm convictions over a headline and inversely not_selling the first 15 % pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times . Yes there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry but its often much later than you think . Overall it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026 . Regardless of the returns or bull market luck I became an immensely better investor throughout the process . Let me know if you have any questions about the process results or in general ."

      "selftext": "I moved my 50kish (between Roth and Rollover IRA) from my old employers retirement plan over to Schwab savings account \\[\\[\\[EDIT - I've since moved them over to Fidelity but transfer not completed yet\\]\\]. I chose not to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later, which is now. I've gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I can't help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations. I don't trust them. I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity that's still with them. It's 51% domestic stock, 38% foreign stock, 10% bonds (roughly). From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96% with Index of 22.98%. So it's actually 18k+ right now, not 15 as I thought it was last time I checked. I also have a bunch of Ethereum (I already withdrew my initial investment) and it's valued anywhere between 150,000-200,000 based on the numbers of the past month. I'm not banking on it, it's just an extra atm. What should I do with this? I have no kids, single at 37, very little debt (just vehicle) but I'm unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k\\~ salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment. I have about 30k+ in savings. I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner. Any and every advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Edit: I do not own my home, I'm back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation. I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact. I'm not counting on any inheritance. Though if I'm able to square my parents a way where they're safe and secure through the rest of their lives, they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there. Additional Edit: I've now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess 'lets goooo'. I dunno. Just tryin to survive here while having a good time",

I chose not_to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later which is now . Ive gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I cant help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations . I dont trust them . I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity thats still with them . Its 51 % domestic stock 38 % foreign stock 10 % bonds roughly . From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96 % with Index of 22.98 % . So its actually 18k right now not_15 as I thought it was last time I checked . I also have a bunch of Ethereum I already withdrew my initial investment and its valued anywhere between 150000200000 based on the numbers of the past month . Im not_banking on it its just an extra atm . What should I do with this I have no_kids single at 37 very little debt just vehicle but Im unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment . I have about 30k in savings . I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner . Any and every advice would be appreciated . Thank you . Edit I do not_own my home Im back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation . I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact . Im not_counting on any inheritance . Though if Im able to square my parents a way where theyre safe and secure through the rest of their lives they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there . Additional Edit Ive now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess lets goooo . I dunno . Just tryin to survive here while having a good time"

      "selftext": "As I've posted before here, I'm neck deep into RKT shares, from my one and ONLY YOLO from 5+ yrs ago, starting with WAMPQ ->WMIH -> COOP -> RKT last year. I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once). I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once. On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a \"Millionaire Tax\" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in \"investment\" income? I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \\*when\\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade. For example, today's losses came from getting \"caught\" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened..... Half of today's \"Loss\" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year. Any questions, happy to discuss.",

I also started getting into Options both buying AND selling them last year after learning from you all and other Reddit forums to generate income against those shares because I dont want tocant practically sell them all at once . I was and in some way still am a novice when it comes to Options and needed to learn about DTEs DeltaTheta etc by trial and ERROR . I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $ $ $ all at once . On Taxes Did you know that theres something called a Millionaire Tax surcharge in MA And that theres a 4 % NIIT Net Investment Income Tax at the Federal Level at $ 200k single $ 300k or more in investment income I also had to LEARN the HARD way when to sell Covered Calls PUTS when NOT_to when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS when you need to just BTC Buy To Close a losing Options Trade . For example todays losses came from getting caught in an overnight 10 % runup in RKT last week after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet and then dropped the $ 200B MBS bombshell afterhours . I knew RKT would get to this range but I assumed it would get to todays level after FebEarnings . Then the tweets happened ..... Half of todays Loss is from Rolling a couple of CCs upout so the loss wasnt that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend like 23x WORSE before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning . Most of RKTs potential is already priced in given the runup for now but I do expect it to be into the high $ 20s next year which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $ 10s range last year . Any questions happy to discuss ."

Whereas a weighted ETF would also need to remove this same holding entirely if it's removed from the index, plus it also needs to adjust weights periodically to match market caps even when a holding isn't removed from the underlying index.

      "selftext": "Source - [ Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns. Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels. Private prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities. Big tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial. Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere. This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns . Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a volatility factor where reputational damage employee dissent and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels . Private prison operators GEO Group GEO and CoreCivic CXW carry the highest concentration risk with GEO deriving roughly 40 % of revenue from ICErelated operations . Despite benefiting from postelection enforcement expansion both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities . Big tech names including Palantir PLTR and Amazon AMZN face a different threat internal resistance . Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts while Amazons AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial . Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sectors exposure . Marriott MAR and Hilton HLT face what the report calls brand contagion risk where franchiselevel decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts . Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere . This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts dont automatically mean safe revenue anymore ."

That gave Alphabet an official market capitalization of just over $4 trillion.

      "selftext": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views. No idea why. Wasn't selling anything, wasn't pumping tickers, just sharing my thinking. Whatever. Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently that's a problem. **What I think is happening:** * Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there. * Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is. * Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment. * That buys a window where risk assets can run. **Then last night happened:** * DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates. * Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" * He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates. * Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. \"Sell America\" trade came back. * But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business. **What this means:** * Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead. * Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026. * Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures. **Path one, the pump:** * Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up. * Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat. * Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips. * Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well. **Path two, the collapse:** * Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions. * \"Sell America\" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together. * Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance. * Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates. * Everything falls apart. **Here's the thing though:** * Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less. * Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios. **Signals I'm watching:** * Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple \"Sell America\" days in a row means it's real. * Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess. * Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done. * Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice. * Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal. * Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something. **When I get out:** * Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours * Defense budgets stall * Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus * Actual military conflict, not just talk **Where I'm positioned:** * Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing * Mix of shares and longer dated options * Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly **Bottom line:** * Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026 * Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies * Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore I'm comfortable with those odds.",

      "selftext_processed": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views . No_idea why . Wasnt selling anything wasnt pumping tickers just sharing my thinking . Whatever . Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently thats a problem . What I think is happening Trump needs the market to rip into midterms . Thats it . Thats the whole thing . Everything else flows from there . Tax cuts deregulation defense spending rate cuts cash handouts to the base . He needs wins he can point to and stock market go up is the easiest win there is . Meanwhile nobody_wants to test him right now . Maduro got snatched . That sent a message . Irans not_going to do anything crazy . Putins going to wait and see . Chinas playing nice for the moment . That buys a window where risk assets can run . Then last night happened DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell . The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed . The actual reason according to Powell himself is that Trump wants lower rates . Powell posted a video Sunday night . Direct quote The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president . He said that . On camera . The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates . Gold hit record highs overnight . Dollar sold off . Futures dumped . Sell America trade came back . But by midday stocks had mostly recovered . Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs . Selloff panic stabilization back to business . What this means Short term volatility . Markets dont like Fed independence being threatened . Chop ahead . Medium term probably bullish If Trump gets his rate cuts whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May thats rocket fuel for stocks . Bad for the dollar bad for inflation eventually but good for equities through 2026 . Long term this is where it splits into two very different futures . Path one the pump Trump gets what he wants . Rates come down . Housing unfreezes . Consumer spending picks up . Defense budget passes . $ 1.5T proposed . Counterdrone AI infrastructure domestic manufacturing all eat . Deregulation everywhere . Crypto rips . Tech rips . Everything rips . Market pumps into midterms . People with risk assets do well . Path two the collapse Trump doesnt stop at pressuring the Fed . He breaks it . Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions . Sell America stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend . Bonds dollar and stocks all falling together . Or he goes further . Starts taking territory seizing assets from other countries because the spending isnt sustainable otherwise . World wants to respond but cant at first because US military dominance . Internal resistance builds . Coup paralysis who knows . Or we stumble into a real conflict . China moves on Taiwan . Russia escalates . Iran miscalculates . Everything falls apart . Heres the thing though Even in path two some stuff still works . Defense doesnt go down during wars . AI infrastructure still matters . Critical minerals become more critical not_less . Unless it goes nuclear . Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios . Signals Im watching Fed independence . If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early major red flag . Multiple Sell America days in a row means its real . Defense budget . $ 1.5T passes defense names keep working . Stalls or gets blocked time to reassess . Supreme Court on Lisa Cook . Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors . He wins Fed independence is done . Credit card cap . Trump floated 10 % today . Banks cratered . If this happens hes willing to break things for short term juice . Foreign treasury holders . China and Japan start dumping in size thats the real signal . Gold . Already at records . Keeps ripping while stocks chop smart money is positioning for something . When I get out Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days not_hours Defense budgets stall Bonds dollar stocks all falling together for a week plus Actual military conflict not_just talk Where Im positioned Themes defense AI infrastructure critical minerals domestic semis some housing Mix of shares and longer dated options Stuff that wins if Trump pumps but doesnt completely die if things get ugly Bottom line Bull case market pumps into midterms I take profits in 2026 Bear case system breaks but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies Worst case nukes and nobody_cares about stonks anymore Im comfortable with those odds ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’ve been digging into Dateline Resources lately, and man, I’m seriously bullish on this one. Ticker is DTR on the ASX, or DTREF over the counter. It’s a gold and rare earths play out in California, right next to that big MP Materials operation, which gives it some real strategic edge in the US market. Their recent drilling at the Colosseum project has been killer, hitting these wide gold intercepts like 295 meters at over a gram per ton from surface. Stuff like that extends way beyond their current resource, and they’re talking about updating the mineral estimate soon. Plus, they’ve got board appointments with some heavy hitters in mining, which tells me the team’s leveling up for bigger things. Price-wise, it’s been on a tear. Shot up from pennies last year to around 32 cents now, with an 18 percent jump just today on solid volume. Yeah, there might be some pullbacks, but gold prices are through the roof, and with AI and tech booming, demand for rare earths is only going higher. They’re eyeing a bankable feasibility study in the first quarter, and if those rare earth targets pan out, this could be massive. I’m loading up because I see huge upside here, especially with the push for domestic critical minerals. No rush to sell, though, I’m in for the long haul with patience. The location, the results, and the market trends all line up. What do you all think? Anyone else holding?",

The deal would reduce the U.S. tariff rate, to 15 percent, for goods from the island, the people said. That rate is in line with imports from Japan and South Korea, Asian allies that struck deals last year.",

      "selftext": "Hello all, I was hoping you could help me figure out how to rebalance my portfolio. I'm ~40yo, make around $180/yr in a HCOL area. I'm currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation. It's my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades. Whether due to normal economics, political turmoil, dedollarization, end of reserve currency status, purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets. To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner. Here's a brief summary of my accounts. some of the data is obfuscated but you can get the point. Accounts are over multiple lines and all of the rows of that similar name are the accounts holdings. | Account Name | Symbol | Description | Quantity | Current Value (rounded) | Percent Of Account | |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:| | Main Brokerage | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$32,800 | 9.19% | | Main Brokerage | VTI | VANGUARD INDEX FDS VANGUARD TOTAL STK MKT ETF | 601.722 | ~$203,900 | 57.11% | | Main Brokerage | VXUS | VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX FUND | 129.317 | ~$10,000 | 2.80% | | Main Brokerage | BND | VANGUARD BD INDEX FDS TOTAL BND MRKT | 166.292 | ~$12,300 | 3.46% | | Main Brokerage | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 518.761 | ~$98,000 | 27.44% | | Rollover IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Rollover IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 2311.105 | ~$436,400 | 100.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 520 | ~$98,200 | 100.00% | | IRA MOM | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | IRA MOM | FPIFX | FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2020 INVESTOR | 926.689 | ~$15,800 | 59.71% | | IRA MOM | FFFAX | FIDELITY FREEDOM RETIREMENT FUND | 937.059 | ~$10,600 | 40.29% | | 401K | FXAIX | FID 500 INDEX | 690.839 | ~$165,600 | 100.00% | | HYSA | | | | ~$100,000 | 100.00% | I was thinking that in tax advantaged accounts it would be good to move to VXUS or FTIHX. Both total international funds. My goal is to have international exposure. But I also don't want to lose out on growth. Maybe in the Roth IRA have a fund that is more aggressive like Contrafund or Blue chip or tech select. any advice would be great and appreciated. I just don't want to make a mistake and you I know are smarter than I. Thank you",

Im currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation . Its my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades . Whether due to normal economics political turmoil dedollarization end of reserve currency status purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets . To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner .

      "title": "Five Cheap AI Stocks To Watch When The Sector Rotates",
      "selftext": "When AI heats up, low-priced names often move first because traders pile into what is liquid and headline-sensitive. This is the short list I watch under $6. My 5 AI tickers to watch: **- BBAI** **- REKR** **- RIME** **- NOTE** **- GCT** Why I keep them: RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real run-rate metrics. The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M during 2025 and cited $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike. NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play \"AI SaaS\" sentiment without needing it to be in logistics. When software and AI sentiment improves, names like this can move on category flows. REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play. It is not pure freight optimization, but it is connected to the same idea: AI applied to real-world mobility systems, which can catch a sector bid. Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI, or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates? Do your own homework.",

My 5 AI tickers to watch BBAI REKR RIME NOTE GCT Why I keep them RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real runrate metrics . The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220 % from $ 2.5M to over $ 8M during 2025 and cited $ 15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions source type company press release . That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike . NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play AI SaaS sentiment without needing it to be in logistics . When software and AI sentiment improves names like this can move on category flows . REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play . It is not_pure freight optimization but it is connected to the same idea AI applied to realworld mobility systems which can catch a sector bid . Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates Do your own homework ."

      "title": "Powell vs Trump escalation ... markets are starting to price the risk",
      "selftext": "Last night Jerome Powell said the DOJ subpoenas into the Fed came alongside pressure from the Trump administration to push rate cuts. He made it clear the Fed won’t bend policy decisions to political pressure. Markets reacted quickly. Futures dipped, the dollar softened, and gold caught a bid, not because policy changed but because confidence in Fed independence matters a lot for equities. This hits stocks in a subtle way. A Fed that looks pressured adds uncertainty around rates, inflation control, and long-term valuations. That’s not great for risk assets that have been pricing a smooth path into 2026. Feels less like short-term drama and more like something investors need to keep on the radar when positioning for the year ahead. Feels like positioning now at these prices is a bit more risk, at least for short term gains.",

He made it clear the Fed won ’ t bend policy decisions to political pressure . Markets reacted quickly . Futures dipped the dollar softened and gold caught a bid not_because policy changed but because confidence in Fed independence matters a lot for equities . This hits stocks in a subtle way . A Fed that looks pressured adds uncertainty around rates inflation control and longterm valuations . That ’ s not_great for risk assets that have been pricing a smooth path into 2026 . Feels less like shortterm drama and more like something investors need to keep on the radar when positioning for the year ahead . Feels like positioning now at these prices is a bit more risk at least for short term gains ."

Now my question is: if markets don't care nor react to this either, will that not just prove to Trump that he is right and he can go even further?

      "selftext": "I’m 20 from Australia, qualified in a physically demanding trade. I work early mornings, long days. I earn around $1,800 a week after tax including overtime, and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $47 to $55 an hour. I’m posting this because I want honest feedback, not validation. Where am I being naive? Where am I overthinking it? Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me? My general philosophy with money is this: build slowly, test myself honestly, and earn the right to press harder later. I’m playing the long game, but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it. I’m ambitious and not satisfied with “average good outcomes”. I want more, but not recklessly. I’m very aware that consistency beats intensity, and that most people fail because they scale too early, not too late. So this is how I currently run things. I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI, based on about 90% of my income so there’s always buffer. Weekly it looks like this: $400 for core living expenses, $160 for lifestyle, $300 towards a house deposit, $100 for travel or bigger purchases, and $600 into investing. Total is $1,560 a week. Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading. Every category has its own savings account. All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday. No rolling balances, no bullshit. Lifestyle is intentionally tight. Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate, but I work a physical job and I’m not exactly living it up mid-week anyway. I’ve built in room for excess because I know this isn’t sustainable forever. When income grows and life changes, I plan to let myself breathe more. I also keep an $8k emergency fund that I don’t touch, and I’ve got about $7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I’m no longer adding to. For investing, I put $600 a week into US ETFs. Roughly 40% into VGT, 40% into VTI, and 20% into VXUS. This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone. I don’t touch it emotionally. No tinkering, no panic moves, no chasing whatever’s hot this month. Alongside that, I run a small swing trading account, about $2k. This is not income to me. It’s training. I treat trading as skill development, pattern recognition, and learning capital preservation before there’s ever any talk of real leverage. I trade end-of-day swings since I’m in Australia trading US markets. I focus on sector strength, tight consolidations, breakouts and pullbacks, defined risk, and high ADR stocks. Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency. If I ever scale it, the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs, not lifestyle or savings. I’m not relying on trading to save me. I’m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it. Medium term, the next 3–5 years, the goals are straightforward. Keep building a house deposit, buy a property when it actually makes sense, keep ETF compounding going, stay disciplined with trading, and increase income through higher paying roles, specialisation, or side businesses. I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don’t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever. I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn’t care. Fatigue, boredom, temptation, and bad decisions are real. So I’ll ask again, honestly: where am I getting this wrong? Where am I playing it too safe? If you were 20, working a physical job, and thinking long term, what would you change? Am I underutilising my income, or am I actually protecting my future properly? Give me your worst. You old bastards.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m 20 from Australia qualified in a physically demanding trade . I work early mornings long days . I earn around $ 1800 a week after tax including overtime and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $ 47 to $ 55 an hour . I ’ m posting this because I want honest feedback not_validation . Where am I being naive Where am I overthinking it Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me My general philosophy with money is this build slowly test myself honestly and earn the right to press harder later . I ’ m playing the long game but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it . I ’ m ambitious and not_satisfied with “ average good outcomes ” . I want more but not_recklessly . I ’ m very aware that consistency beats intensity and that most people fail because they scale too early not_too late . So this is how I currently run things . I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI based on about 90 % of my income so there ’ s always buffer . Weekly it looks like this $ 400 for core living expenses $ 160 for lifestyle $ 300 towards a house deposit $ 100 for travel or bigger purchases and $ 600 into investing . Total is $ 1560 a week . Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading . Every category has its own savings account . All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday . No_rolling balances no_bullshit . Lifestyle is intentionally tight . Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate but I work a physical job and I ’ m not_exactly living it up midweek anyway . I ’ ve built in room for excess because I know this isn ’ t sustainable forever . When income grows and life changes I plan to let myself breathe more . I also keep an $ 8k emergency fund that I don ’ t touch and I ’ ve got about $ 7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I ’ m no_longer adding to . For investing I put $ 600 a week into US ETFs . Roughly 40 % into VGT 40 % into VTI and 20 % into VXUS . This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone . I don ’ t touch it emotionally . No_tinkering no_panic moves no_chasing whatever ’ s hot this month . Alongside that I run a small swing trading account about $ 2k . This is not_income to me . It ’ s training . I treat trading as skill development pattern recognition and learning capital preservation before there ’ s ever any talk of real leverage . I trade endofday swings since I ’ m in Australia trading US markets . I focus on sector strength tight consolidations breakouts and pullbacks defined risk and high ADR stocks . Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency . If I ever scale it the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs not_lifestyle or savings . I ’ m not_relying on trading to save me . I ’ m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it . Medium term the next 3–5 years the goals are straightforward . Keep building a house deposit buy a property when it actually makes sense keep ETF compounding going stay disciplined with trading and increase income through higher paying roles specialisation or side businesses . I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don ’ t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever . I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn ’ t care . Fatigue boredom temptation and bad decisions are real . So I ’ ll ask again honestly where am I getting this wrong Where am I playing it too safe If you were 20 working a physical job and thinking long term what would you change Am I underutilising my income or am I actually protecting my future properly Give me your worst . You old bastards ."

      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

      "selftext": "I've got $130k to deploy. The companies I'd like to hold are all pretty AI stack related (with some exceptions), and they're all basically at all time highs. Is a basket of basically Mag7 stocks - with some data center and defense additions - a solid portfolio for next 5-10 years or is concentration risk too much? (also got another 100-120k coming to deploy in a few months) Here are my 3 scenarios: 1 - MAG7 stocks with highest weight in AMZN, with some extra picks - TSM, SHLD, VRT, PWR, RYCEY, ABBNY (yea all at highs) 2 - Keep large base in VOO(60-70%?) - add high confiction singles - AMZM, NVDA, TSM, VRT, SHLD 3 - just 100% VOO and dont pick winners My brain is telling me 1 is too high on concentration risk but on the other hand the market is basically just the mag 7 right now anyway. any thoughts appreciated",

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

Don ’ t expect any big numbers I have a small account 10K The inverse iron condor strat So a regular iron condor is simple enough . An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit defined riskreward long theta short Vega delta neutral at start . The DTE is your choice but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty which makes sense you want the price to stay between your short strikes and thus let the entire spread expire worthless . The other wellknown strat is a reverse or long iron condor which is an otm debit put and call spread and this time it ’ s short theta long Vega delta neutral at start . This one you want the price to move drastically up or down . With me so far Congrats you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly . So what ’ s different with the inverse iron condor Simple my problem was this I hate entering a trade for a debit . And my thesis Markets don ’ t stay the same in a longer period of time . Solution open a fully itm credit callput spread for a net CREDIT short theta LONG Vega delta neutral at start and we want price to move drastically now . Give yourself a bit of time for market to move 95DTE approx and bob ’ s your uncle . But you tell me you ’ re really dumb . You could ’ ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same PL outlook . Aren ’ t you even thinking about early assignment Why yes dear reader . You are absolutely correct . Because of early assignment risk I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is Europeanstyle . As for the condor I forgor 💀 really that ’ s the only reason . Do a regular credit condor if you want I ’ m not_your mom . So to sum up buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry same strike widths apart . Market dumps you win . Market rallies you win Market flatlines you lose . If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT ’ s help I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole . For now here ’ s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don ’ t want to mess around with early assignment risk ."

Powell said the probe was the result of the [Fed]( “setting [interest rates]( based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of President [Donald Trump](\" As a result, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 199 points. S&P 500 futures shed 0.5% and Nasdaq-100 futures lost 0.7% as investors took off some risk on this new, more tense stage of the standoff between Trump and the Fed. Postscript Edit: Chuckling about the open. Why? I oversee my $2.3 million + investment account and as of a minute ago - I am up $988 dollars and some cents . . . I truly expected to be down about $20-40K. lol Postscript 2 Edit: I hope no one sold! Glad to be wrong, as I am up about $10-11K at 10:31am PT.",

SP 500 futures shed 0.5 % and Nasdaq100 futures lost 0.7 % as investors took off some risk on this new more tense stage of the standoff between Trump and the Fed .

      "selftext": "My two cents on Petco. Petco’s equity is priced for bankruptcy, while its cash flow, liquidity, and credit markets price it as a surviving, self-funding business, creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize. The company is trading at \\~5.5x EBITDA and a \\~11-13% FCF yield on normalized numbers. The balance sheet, while levered, is structured with a long runway (2028) and flexible covenants. The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation. Just a point I want to make, most screeners show Petco trading at EV/EBITDA of \\~11x, whilst showing the EV as \\~$3.55 billion. I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet. The cost of these leases have already hit the P&L through either COGS or SG&A. EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders. The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric. If we want to include operating leases as part of EV, the we should use the EBITDAR metric. Alternatively, we can just strip out the operating leases. The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event. This framing is wrong. Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF, a covenant lite capital structure, no meaningful debt maturities until 2028, credit markets signalling survival, not distress. The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not support. For equity to be impaired, three conditions must occur simultaneously: 1. Material EBITDA collapse 2. Inability to service interest 3. Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21% YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue, interest is covered \\~3x, the \\~$1.6 billion Term Loan is covenant-lite and matures in 2028, the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability. Petco is now self-funding and does not rely on capital markets to operate. This is not a growth story. Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization, continued FCF generation, gradual deleveraging toward \\~3x net leverage. Under this base case, bankruptcy risk collapses, short interest (\\~20%) unwinds and the stock rerates from \\~5.5x to \\~7x EV/EBITDA. This implies \\~50–70% upside without heroic assumptions. Even in a stressed scenario (continued revenue decline, margin pressure, tariffs), interest remains covered, FCF remains positive, and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months. Downside is owning a slow growth, cash generative retailer, not a zero. The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not support. If the company simply stabilizes, the equity is materially undervalued. Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this.",

      "selftext_processed": "My two cents on Petco . Petco ’ s equity is priced for bankruptcy while its cash flow liquidity and credit markets price it as a surviving selffunding business creating massive upside if operations merely stabilize . The company is trading at 5.5x EBITDA and a 1113 % FCF yield on normalized numbers . The balance sheet while levered is structured with a long runway 2028 and flexible covenants . The operational pivot under Joel Anderson is already beginning to show in the form of margin expansion and cash generation . Just a point I want to make most screeners show Petco trading at EVEBITDA of 11x whilst showing the EV as $ 3.55 billion . I think this is incorrect as the EV includes the operating leases capitalised on the balance sheet . The cost of these leases have already hit the PL through either COGS or SGA . EBITDA is the earnings attributable to equity and debt holders . The amounts paid to lessors has already been accounted for in the EBITDA metric . If we want to include operating leases as part of EV the we should use the EBITDAR metric . Alternatively we can just strip out the operating leases . The market views Petco as a structurally impaired discretionary retailer facing a liquidity event . This framing is wrong . Petco is primarily a recurring consumables and services business with positive and growing FCF a covenant lite capital structure no_meaningful debt maturities until 2028 credit markets signalling survival not_distress . The equity market is extrapolating past capital misallocation and near term revenue declines into a solvency crisis that the numbers do not_support . For equity to be impaired three conditions must occur simultaneously 1 . Material EBITDA collapse 2 . Inability to service interest 3 . Lender ability to force action None are present today as EBITDA grew 21 % YoY in Q3 2025 despite declining revenue interest is covered 3x the $ 1.6 billion Term Loan is covenantlite and matures in 2028 the ABL is undrawn with substantial excess availability . Petco is now selffunding and does not_rely on capital markets to operate . This is not_a growth story . Equity upside requires only EBITDA stabilization continued FCF generation gradual deleveraging toward 3x net leverage . Under this base case bankruptcy risk collapses short interest 20 % unwinds and the stock rerates from 5.5x to 7x EVEBITDA . This implies 50–70 % upside without heroic assumptions . Even in a stressed scenario continued revenue decline margin pressure tariffs interest remains covered FCF remains positive and liquidity runway extends beyond 24 months . Downside is owning a slow growth cash generative retailer not_a zero . The market is pricing a liquidity event that the math does not_support . If the company simply stabilizes the equity is materially undervalued . Happy to answer any questions and get information from other investors who have looked at this ."

But everything online tells me GGLL is meant for day trading? I understand what they mean, but if I really think google will be more successful - wouldn’t it make sense to have 2x leveraged shares ?",

      "selftext": "Hi, so I've bought the following stocks right after I finished school and started earning some money before I started attending university around 2020: Zscaler, UI Patch, Roku, Digital Ocean, Upstart Holdings, Teamviewer, Docusign, Fiverr, Unity Software Back then I thought it was a smart idea to invest the little money I had from the part time jobs I was working to \"get a head start\" into adult life. The problem was that I definitely didnt do any research on the stocks I bought. I let myself be guided by articles from unreputable sources and people whose interest was simply to get you to buy their subscription for \"stock recommendations\" and literally paid the price, The total amount of 2200€ I invested back then are only worth 1000€ today. Luckily, I learned a lot since then, gratuated, started investing a fixed amount of money into the S&P on a monthly basis and bought a few stocks I actually did my own research on. Basically, I turned it around and I am now much happier with how my portfolio looks today than it did around 5~6 years ago. Still, everytime I scroll down to these stocks in my portfolio I get embarrased of my own actions and even though I know it would be the correct move, it's hard to sell these stocks at a loss. I know that by selling I have to finally admit to myself that my actions were stupid, and that's not easy. Sure, the amount of money is small compared to my portfolio today or what I earn now that I have a good job, but when it comes to these stocks my mind goes back to 2020 version of myself when I sent money from my regular banking account into my investment account for the first time and feeling Like a king for investing into the stock market that I Always heard about in the news. Somehow it kept me from acting rationally all these years. Anyway, feel free to laugh at me for crying over losing 1200€ but also feel free to share your own story or words of advise, I'll gladly read them! Good luck!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi so Ive bought the following stocks right after I finished school and started earning some money before I started attending university around 2020 Zscaler UI Patch Roku Digital Ocean Upstart Holdings Teamviewer Docusign Fiverr Unity Software Back then I thought it was a smart idea to invest the little money I had from the part time jobs I was working to get a head start into adult life . The problem was that I definitely didnt do any research on the stocks I bought . I let myself be guided by articles from unreputable sources and people whose interest was simply to get you to buy their subscription for stock recommendations and literally paid the price The total amount of 2200€ I invested back then are only worth 1000€ today . Luckily I learned a lot since then gratuated started investing a fixed amount of money into the SP on a monthly basis and bought a few stocks I actually did my own research on . Basically I turned it around and I am now much happier with how my portfolio looks today than it did around 56 years ago . Still everytime I scroll down to these stocks in my portfolio I get embarrased of my own actions and even though I know it would be the correct move its hard to sell these stocks at a loss . I know that by selling I have to finally admit to myself that my actions were stupid and thats not_easy . Sure the amount of money is small compared to my portfolio today or what I earn now that I have a good job but when it comes to these stocks my mind goes back to 2020 version of myself when I sent money from my regular banking account into my investment account for the first time and feeling Like a king for investing into the stock market that I Always heard about in the news . Somehow it kept me from acting rationally all these years . Anyway feel free to laugh at me for crying over losing 1200€ but also feel free to share your own story or words of advise Ill gladly read them Good luck"

      "selftext": "How many people are honestly still investing in stocks *just* to study fundamentals Because, honestly, I’m starting to doubt it. What’s the point of investing in the first place? Isn’t it to maximize returns? Isn’t it to beat inflation? I trade more on the short-term side, and yeah, it’s been working for me. But the moment I mention I’ve owned Tesla or ASTS, someone always jumps in like Bro, that’s just speculation Okay. So what if it is? People love to talk about value. Like unless you’re talking earnings reports, P/E ratios, or DCF models, it somehow doesn’t count as real value. But to me, value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money *within a level of risk I’m comfortable with*? If a stock makes me money, improves my life, and moves me closer to the future I want, then yeah that’s a good stock *to me* Value isn’t something written in textbooks. It’s not just numbers in a spreadsheet. It shows up in your account balance. And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time. You’re a gambler You’ll blow up eventually You don’t understand investing Fine. I’ll say it. In a way, I *am* a gambler.But I’m not gambling on a quick jackpot. I’m gambling on being a better father. On my kids getting a better education. On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life. On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I’m gambling on the future. And I’m gambling with responsibility. So what about you?You’re gambling too. You’re gambling that the system always works. That markets stay rational. That the theories you learned never break.If your so called “value investing” keeps you stuck, while my “speculation” keeps pushing me closer to my goals, then who’s really closer to the point of investing?And if that makes me a gambler then fuck it. I’m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？",

What ’ s the point of investing in the first place Isn ’ t it to maximize returns Isn ’ t it to beat inflation I trade more on the shortterm side and yeah it ’ s been working for me . But the moment I mention I ’ ve owned Tesla or ASTS someone always jumps in like Bro that ’ s just speculation Okay . So what if it is People love to talk about value . Like unless you ’ re talking earnings reports PE ratios or DCF models it somehow doesn ’ t count as real value . But to me value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money within a level of risk I ’ m comfortable with If a stock makes me money improves my life and moves me closer to the future I want then yeah that ’ s a good stock to me Value isn ’ t something written in textbooks . It ’ s not_just numbers in a spreadsheet . It shows up in your account balance . And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time . You ’ re a gambler You ’ ll blow up eventually You don ’ t understand investing Fine . I ’ ll say it . In a way I am a gambler.But I ’ m not_gambling on a quick jackpot . I ’ m gambling on being a better father . On my kids getting a better education . On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life . On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I ’ m gambling on the future . And I ’ m gambling with responsibility . So what about youYou ’ re gambling too . You ’ re gambling that the system always works . That markets stay rational . That the theories you learned never_break.If your so called “ value investing ” keeps you stuck while my “ speculation ” keeps pushing me closer to my goals then who ’ s really closer to the point of investingAnd if that makes me a gambler then fuck it . I ’ m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？"

      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls. Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not a financial professional in any capacity.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."

      "selftext": "I currently run my portfolio and trades through a self-directed investment account through my bank. I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app. It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock. Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned, I and considering moving everything to robinhood. Almost every picture I see of other’s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining user-friendly. The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky. It only loads through a pop-up window, and closes every time I leave the app. It does not provide enough of information on the tearsheet, so I have to go in and out, reloading the page every time I am researching. There are also some stocks that are not available to purchase when I search for them (KRKNF). The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock. I may be misinformed, so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood. My understanding is that yes, robinhood is FDIC insured, but behind the screen, when you “buy” a stock, you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool. When you “buy” a stock on the app, Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood. What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform? Would it be worth transferring my portfolio? Additionally, are there any other secure, FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked?",

      "selftext_processed": "I currently run my portfolio and trades through a selfdirected investment account through my bank . I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app . It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock . Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned I and considering moving everything to robinhood . Almost every picture I see of other ’ s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining userfriendly . The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky . It only loads through a popup window and closes every time I leave the app . It does not_provide enough of information on the tearsheet so I have to go in and out reloading the page every time I am researching . There are also some stocks that are not_available to purchase when I search for them KRKNF . The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock . I may be misinformed so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood . My understanding is that yes robinhood is FDIC insured but behind the screen when you “ buy ” a stock you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool . When you “ buy ” a stock on the app Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood . What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform Would it be worth transferring my portfolio Additionally are there any other secure FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked"

      "selftext": "As of the latest update (Jan 5, 2026), Strategy holds 673,783 BTC. With Bitcoin sitting around $90,600 today, that's roughly $61 BILLION in Bitcoin treasury value alone (closed Jan 9 at $157.33/share, market cap around $45.5B on most trackers). the math: We're getting $61B worth of Bitcoin for a $45-48B valuation. That's a 20-25%+ discount to fair NAV, something that almost NEVER happens with MSTR. Historically it trades at massive premiums (50-100%+) because of Saylor's leverage genius, future acquisition potential, and the \"Bitcoin yield\" play. But right now? After the recent volatility, unrealized loss noise, and all the MSCI FUD, the market seems like the biggest bargain in years. MSCI backed off full delisting and confirmed retention (with some new share caps), which removed the forced-selling overhang and sparked relief pump last week. Yet the stock still hasn't fully repriced the true value. Add in the fact they just stacked another 1,286 BTC early Jan, boosted cash reserves to $2.25B, probably ready for more buys, this discount won't last once BTC pushes back toward $100k+. This feels like a good entry point. Does this add up? Think we'll see premium flip back hard on the next leg up?",

      "title": "Looking for portfolio feedback- GGUS/UGL/Senior AUD bank bonds",
      "selftext": "I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this long-term strategy as an Australian investor (40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% AUD cash/senior bank bonds, 10% aussie miners/personal stock picks) with 20% bands, yearly rebalancing), where it could go wrong, and for constructive critique. The basic premise is that over the next 7-10 years, the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD (mean-reversion), and a number of other considerations, like higher US inflation to be expected. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold, but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower. In addition, I do not see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal. US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of Medicare/Social Security, and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze, so only inflation or higher taxation are viable long-term solutions (unless the US gets rid of the above). Given the political paralysis, higher taxation is unlikely, and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office (besides tariffs, which do not meaningfully compensate for tax cuts). GGUS is 80-100% overall AUD currency-hedged S&P500 exposure, UGL is 60%ish USD-denominated gold exposure, and the 20% cash/Australian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash. There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered, and how this portfolio would play out. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **1. War/Significant geopolitical event** GGUS will likely crash, UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos. Enables rebalancing. I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease (climate refugees etc.). **2. Persistent US inflation** Since I'm hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not a major concern for me, and since economically companies price based on inflation, I'm economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates (expected in the near term). Gold is also useful for this. **3. Stock market crash (bubble popping)** This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping. In the near term, stocks will fall. Gold may be mixed effects, there for rebalancing. Cash also there for rebalancing. Appears there's a long-term mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful. **4. Deflation** I don't believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in- central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates. However, under this scenario, the portfolio does lose considerable value. **5. Tariff death spiral** Stocks will crash, gold will likely soar as it's not dependent on government policy. Rebalance, buy the dip, TACO. **6. Bond vigilantes** This is possible in the next 5-10 years if inflation is too high and long-term bond investors are not happy with a dovish Fed's low interest rates. Cash/short-term senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing, and I'm happy to hold. Gold/cash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS. **7. The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds** I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio. Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting, slightly higher, but an additional risk I'm willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash. **8. Gold prices decrease** This is possible- gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing, likely because of saturation from miners. Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL, I may experience more losses as a result, but for me it's worth the insurance policy. In the long term, it's an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease, and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation. So I'm fine with this risk. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any future likely scenarios I haven't considered? I've also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past (\\~14-15%/annum) with okay drawdowns, not a predictor of future returns, but still. Ideally, I still would've preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40% portion (for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay), but that doesn't really exist in a liquid form. Perhaps the only semi-likely scenario I've thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together, but that's unlikely. **TL;DR:** I'm a young early-20's Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually. I'm stress testing a 40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% senior Australian bank bonds (QPON)/10% fun money portfolio (with 20% bands and yearly rebalancing) and would like some feedback/thoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term. The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes, and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons (see US debt-to-GDP), enabling higher returns in currency-hedged leveraged S&P500 and gold. If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF I'd be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40% portion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Id like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this longterm strategy as an Australian investor 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % AUD cashsenior bank bonds 10 % aussie minerspersonal stock picks with 20 % bands yearly rebalancing where it could go wrong and for constructive critique . The basic premise is that over the next 710 years the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD meanreversion and a number of other considerations like higher US inflation to be expected . This is for a number of reasons mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower . In addition I do not_see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debttoGDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal . US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of MedicareSocial Security and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze so only inflation or higher taxation are viable longterm solutions unless the US gets rid of the above . Given the political paralysis higher taxation is unlikely and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office besides tariffs which do not_meaningfully compensate for tax cuts . GGUS is 80100 % overall AUD currencyhedged SP500 exposure UGL is 60 % ish USDdenominated gold exposure and the 20 % cashAustralian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash . There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered and how this portfolio would play out . 1 . WarSignificant geopolitical event GGUS will likely crash UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos . Enables rebalancing . I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease climate refugees etc .. 2 . Persistent US inflation Since Im hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not_a major concern for me and since economically companies price based on inflation Im economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates expected in the near term . Gold is also useful for this . 3 . Stock market crash bubble popping This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping . In the near term stocks will fall . Gold may be mixed effects there for rebalancing . Cash also there for rebalancing . Appears theres a longterm mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful . 4 . Deflation I dont believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates . However under this scenario the portfolio does lose considerable value . 5 . Tariff death spiral Stocks will crash gold will likely soar as its not_dependent on government policy . Rebalance buy the dip TACO . 6 . Bond vigilantes This is possible in the next 510 years if inflation is too high and longterm bond investors are not_happy with a dovish Feds low interest rates . Cashshortterm senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing and Im happy to hold . Goldcash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS . 7 . The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio . Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting slightly higher but an additional risk Im willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash . 8 . Gold prices decrease This is possible gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing_likely because of saturation from miners . Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL I may experience more losses as a result but for me its worth the insurance policy . In the long term its an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation . So Im fine with this risk . Are there any future likely scenarios I havent considered Ive also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past 1415 % annum with okay drawdowns not_a predictor of future returns but still . Ideally I still wouldve preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40 % portion for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay but that doesnt really exist in a liquid form . Perhaps the only semilikely scenario Ive thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together but thats unlikely . TLDR Im a young early20s Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually . Im stress testing a 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % senior Australian bank bonds QPON10 % fun money portfolio with 20 % bands and yearly rebalancing and would like some feedbackthoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term . The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons see US debttoGDP enabling higher returns in currencyhedged leveraged SP500 and gold . If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF Id be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40 % portion ."

      "selftext": "Okay, so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not gotten a job. My sister is a data analyst who makes about $120k. Her whole team is getting fired (yahoo) and she has been saying how much trouble she's having in trying to get a senior data analyst job. She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help. She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs. When I look at online forums(like reddit) in regards to IT, Software, data, etc jobs... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only senior-level jobs are being sought out for. Juniors are flat out not getting hired. Now, as the tech market is clearly not doing well, I've talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields... I get the gist that nobody is having an easy time in the white collar industry. That white-collar is oversaturated... I'm guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from mid-level and senior-level positions. So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field... wouldn't this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market? I can see how in the short-term that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expenditures(employee expenses), but wouldn't this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm? Are these major ceo's even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports? Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up? Essentially the upper-middle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population. Btw my ASTS position is worth $500k w/ cost basis at $6.50 and I'm only working a part time job right now(my whole life actually). I went all-in on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021. I've honestly never had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected. The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $100-200B mkt cap company one day. Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs, they have 3billion current subscribers. This is not counting the people that live in remote areas and don't even own cell phones... the potential is enormous. That said, I want to move out of my parents(I'm 31M) and am scared a recession will kill my gains. I want to hold, but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $200k and get an apartment while I search for a full-time job. I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician, as I have a lot of experience(+10 yrs), but I have 3 degrees. In Philosophy, History, and Comp-Sci from a T-50 public university in the country. I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig, but seemingly nobody wants me. I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to. Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays?? What're your thoughts on AI, the economy, job market and their relationship with the stock market. Thanks...",

      "selftext_processed": "Okay so I graduated with a comp sci degree about a year ago and have not_gotten a job . My sister is a data analyst who makes about $ 120k . Her whole team is getting fired yahoo and she has been saying how much trouble shes having in trying to get a senior data analyst job . She is super into her career and even hires interview coaches to help . She says that everyone is struggling to find tech jobs . When I look at online forumslike reddit in regards to IT Software data etc jobs ... it seems that the whole market is oversaturated and only seniorlevel jobs are being sought out for . Juniors are flat out not_getting hired . Now as the tech market is clearly not_doing well Ive talked to some of my close friends that all have white collar jobs in unrelated fields ... I get the gist that nobody_is having an easy time in the white collar industry . That whitecollar is oversaturated ... Im guessing AI are stealing these jobs by increasing productivity from midlevel and seniorlevel positions . So if a bunch of people are losing high paying careers and being forces into undesirable field ... wouldnt this negatively affect the economy and subsequently the stock market I can see how in the shortterm that earnings reports would be positive by less capital expendituresemployee expenses but wouldnt this be very temporary and probably extremely bearish longterm Are these major ceos even aware or care that they can be potentially nuking the economy so that they have extremely positive earnings reports Can the average salary of the common man go down and the stock market still keep going up Essentially the uppermiddle class to middle class would dwindle into a smaller subsection of the US population . Btw my ASTS position is worth $ 500k w cost basis at $ 6.50 and Im only working a part time job right nowmy whole life actually . I went allin on this company after doing a ton of research in 2021 . Ive honestly never_had money like this in my life and I think it could keep going up if the project is executed as expected . The margins this company can potentially have with an enormous TAM made me see how this could be a $ 100200B mkt cap company one day . Through partnerships with over 50 MNOs they have 3billion current subscribers . This is not_counting the people that live in remote areas and dont even own cell phones ... the potential is enormous . That said I want to move out of my parentsIm 31M and am scared a recession will kill my gains . I want to hold but I feel like the uncertainty around AI and the economy is making me want to pull out like $ 200k and get an apartment while I search for a fulltime job . I can probably get a job as low voltage electrician as I have a lot of experience10 yrs but I have 3 degrees . In Philosophy History and CompSci from a T50 public university in the country . I feel as if I deserve a decent office gig but seemingly nobody_wants me . I used to even get denied data entry jobs that I mass applied to . Do you literally have to know someone to get a office job nowadays Whatre your thoughts on AI the economy job market and their relationship with the stock market . Thanks ..."

      "selftext": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like, and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think there's a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet. These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava, down over like 70% from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend.. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago. 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs. Was down a half a month ago. Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI.. so its a good sign I think? And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and. Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I haven't even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if they're still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me",

      "selftext_processed": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think theres a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet . These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava down over like 70 % from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend .. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago . 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs . Was down a half a month ago . Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI .. so its a good sign I think And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never_even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and . Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I havent even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if theyre still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me"

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m currently looking to strengthen my portfolio with a long-term position (5 to 7 years) and I’m torn between Google (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). I already have a solid foundation in my portfolio (about 88- 90% in VEQT ETF), and I want to use my remaining weight to pick one of these two tech giants. I’m an investor who values stability but is looking for that extra growth \"boost\" over the next decade. My thoughts so far: Google: I like their dominance in search and the massive potential of YouTube. However, I’m curious about how people feel regarding their AI integration (Gemini) compared to competitors. Amazon: Their AWS margins are impressive and the retail side seems to be getting more efficient, but I wonder if the growth ceiling is closer than Google’s. My setup: I trade on Wealthsimple and I’m planning to hold regardless of short-term volatility. My question: For a 5-7 year hold, which one do you think offers the best risk/reward ratio right now? Should I favor Google’s advertising moat or Amazon’s cloud/logistics powerhouse? Thanks for your insights!\"",

      "selftext": "Disclosure: I am short ALK via put options. This is not investment advice. # Why Loyalty Programmes Matter Airlines only fly planes to get to those air mile profits. It's ungodly. Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $12BN when their market cap was $7BN. These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need. ALK has $2BN of debt secured against theirs. So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly, investors should pay very close attention. If this behaviour is not openly discussed and disclosed, but is eased into financial statements without comment, investors should get away first and ask questions later. # The Sparkling Diamond: Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership. Alaska is tied to Bank of America. Here's how it works: Bank of America uses Alaska's miles to induce customers to use their credit cards. When a customer earns miles, Alaska bills Bank of America immediately. The exact numbers aren't disclosed, but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays. When Alaska receives this cash, here's how it's accounted for: The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance - not the cost, the fair value. Per Alaska's 2023 10-K (the last time it was disclosed), this is about 0.75 cents per mile. This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability. The remaining 0.50 cents? That goes straight into \"Loyalty Other Revenue\" - i.e. profit - because there are no further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents. This is a stable, predictable relationship. I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022. Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies, but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent. Until Q2 2025. # The 10σ Anomaly |Period|Alaska σ|United σ|Delta σ|American σ| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Q3 2022|0.58|0.25|1.10|0.27| |Q4 2022|1.06|1.96|1.21|1.07| |Q1 2023|0.40|0.45|0.26|0.19| |Q2 2023|0.23|1.91|1.19|2.38| |Q3 2023|0.11|0.35|0.42|0.28| |Q4 2023|1.01|0.11|1.58|1.54| |Q1 2024|1.25|0.24|1.17|0.31| |Q2 2024|0.47|0.32|0.18|0.25| |Q3 2024|0.84|0.68|0.77|0.41| |Q4 2024|1.68|1.22|0.18|0.48| |Q1 2025|1.41|0.12|1.06|0.28| |Q2 2025|**10.40**|0.01|1.33|0.48| |Q3 2025|0.16|0.12|1.23|0.14| In Q2 2025, Alaska's issuance-to-revenue ratio deviated 10.40 standard deviations from its historical baseline. This isn't the universe ending though statistically it would be. This is a ratio that has completely broken down. There is $180M of liability (points issued) with no corresponding loyalty revenue. The points appeared on the books, but the profit that should accompany them did not. The temptation to grasp at Alaska's recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some re-balancing of the two programmes is irresistible. But where is the expense recorded? Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting? Not there either. Now look at the other side of the balance sheet. Receivables from Affinity Card Partners (read: Bank of America) jumped from $111M to $306M in a single quarter. Something has happened here. Some similar transactions have occurred. You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure. There is none. # The Sneaky Restatement That's not all that happened in Q2. Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10-Q, we find this rather vague statement: Every character in that note is drafted to make you think: \"This doesn't concern me.\" And if you did dig, you'd have a hard time finding what changed. It's two pages away from the affected number. What changed? They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $58M - a 49% revision. Why? No explanation. Just... cute. # Where Did the Money Go? Let's see what washed out in Q3. Receivables from BofA dropped by $129M. You'd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected. But look at the operating cash flow statement. It's not there. No corresponding inflow. Instead, $120M appeared in \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" What happened here? As an investor, I was confidently awaiting $120M in operating cash flow. Instead, all I know now is that as a non-current asset, there is no expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months. No explanation whatsoever. # Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too There's more trouble in this loyalty programme. When customers redeem miles, they can use them on Alaska's own aircraft or on partner airlines. On Alaska's own metal, the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway. But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash. In Q2 and Q3 2025, something extraordinary is happening. The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward - which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme. Partner redemption went from 13.5% of total in 2024, up by 400bp for the same period in 2025. If this is a step up or more significantly, a trend, then that is a material input to the $12BN. |Metric|Q1 2025|Q2 2025|Q3 2025| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |BofA Receivables|$111M|$306M|$177M| |Other Non-Current Assets|\\-|$316M|$436M| |Issuance/Revenue Ratio|Normal|10.40σ|Normal| The Q2 spike appeared. The Q3 \"resolution\" moved money sideways rather than into cash. The ratio reverted as quickly as it broke. This is not how normal business operations look. The absence of any disclosures point in the opposite direction. # What This Means I'm not alleging fraud. I'm pointing out that: 1. Alaska's loyalty economics produced a statistical impossibility in Q2 2025 2. The corresponding balance sheet movements cannot be reconciled from public disclosures 3. A $58M prior-period revision was buried with deliberately vague language 4. $120M migrated to non-current assets without explanation 5. Partner redemption economics are shifting materially A loyalty programme worth $12BN, securing $2BN of debt, with a 10σ accounting anomaly and no management commentary. That demands explanation. Alaska hasn't provided one.",

Its ungodly . Alaska Airlines proudly boasted their loyalty programme is worth $ 12BN when their market cap was $ 7BN . These cash machines are also the stabilisers that volatile airlines need . ALK has $ 2BN of debt secured against theirs . So if the programme starts to behave unexpectedly investors should pay very close attention . If this behaviour is not_openly discussed and disclosed but is eased into financial statements without comment investors should get away first and ask questions later . The Sparkling Diamond Credit Card Partnerships The crown jewel in any loyalty programme is the credit card partnership . Alaska is tied to Bank of America . Heres how it works Bank of America uses Alaskas miles to induce customers to use their credit cards . When a customer earns miles Alaska bills Bank of America immediately . The exact numbers arent disclosed but approximately 1.25 cents per mile is probably what BofA pays . When Alaska receives this cash heres how its accounted for The airline calculates the fair value to fulfil this mileage balance not_the cost the fair value . Per Alaskas 2023 10K the last time it was disclosed this is about 0.75 cents per mile . This goes into deferred revenue as an issued liability . The remaining 0.50 cents That goes straight into Loyalty Other Revenue i.e . profit because there are no_further obligations beyond the 0.75 cents . This is a stable predictable relationship . I calculated the ratio of liability issued to loyalty revenue for Alaska and peers going back to Q3 2022 . Different airlines have different ratios depending on their accounting policies but the relationship within each airline is remarkably consistent . Until Q2 2025 .

This isnt the universe ending though statistically it would be . This is a ratio that has completely broken down . There is $ 180M of liability points issued with no_corresponding loyalty revenue . The points appeared on the books but the profit that should accompany them did not_The temptation to grasp at Alaskas recent purchase of Hawaii Airliners and some rebalancing of the two programmes is irresistible . But where is the expense recorded Oh perhaps in the transaction accounting Not_there either . Now look at the other side of the balance sheet . Receivables from Affinity Card Partners read Bank of America jumped from $ 111M to $ 306M in a single quarter . Something has happened here . Some similar transactions have occurred . You would think this crunching disturbance of norms would demand disclosure . There is none . The Sneaky Restatement Thats not_all that happened in Q2 . Buried in the notes of the Q2 2025 10Q we find this rather vague statement Every character in that note is drafted to make you think This doesnt concern me . And if you did dig youd have a hard time finding what changed . Its two pages away from the affected number . What changed They restated Q4 2024 receivables from Affinity Card Partners upward by $ 58M a 49 % revision . Why No_explanation . Just ... cute . Where Did the Money Go Lets see what washed out in Q3 . Receivables from BofA dropped by $ 129M . Youd think that flowed nicely into cash as expected . But look at the operating cash flow statement . Its not_there . No_corresponding inflow . Instead $ 120M appeared in Other NonCurrent Assets . What happened here As an investor I was confidently awaiting $ 120M in operating cash flow . Instead all I know now is that as a noncurrent asset there is no_expectation that any money will be received for at least twelve months . No_explanation whatsoever . Partner Redemptions Are Spiking Too Theres more trouble in this loyalty programme . When customers redeem miles they can use them on Alaskas own aircraft or on partner airlines . On Alaskas own metal the marginal cost approaches zero if that seat would have flown empty anyway . But partner airlines like Qatar and Cathay Pacific want to be paid in actual cash . In Q2 and Q3 2025 something extraordinary is happening . The ratio of partner airline redemptions to Alaska redemptions is shifting dramatically upward which completely changes the economics of the mileage programme . Partner redemption went from 13.5 % of total in 2024 up by 400bp for the same period in 2025 . If this is a step up or more significantly a trend then that is a material input to the $ 12BN .

      "selftext": "I’ll summarize my diatribe by saying- the moment you hear of people that simply cannot afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number, it’s time to reconsider your exposure. 2018, I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio‘s hedge against inflation. I got push back - “what inflation?”. my rebuttal was and has always been that we don’t invest solely based on what’s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude. inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises. rates were near zero, and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same. right around the time silver crossed the $40 range, I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buying/investing in silver. it seemed to be all the rage. many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position. For them, it was fine. but for the rest of the bunch, the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal. To what end will you invest in silver? where are you hoping to see it? why suddenly now? Mind you, our monetary policy and debt expansion is not anywhere near the free-and-easy regime we saw between ‘18 and ‘21. But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own. They watch what others do, see the price run up, catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it’s ‘all systems go’. My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price. could silver move to $100/oz? surely. could also reach $1,000. my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves. if theres a case for $100, then there’s also a case for $50. the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong? what would that loss do to your time horizon? the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out. this is also costly. opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis. Having said all that, I love silver. It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time. But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom: your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio. Taxes on silver gains, unlike cap gains on stocks, are inescapable. The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure. How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS? and does 28% sound like a fun haircut to get? Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run. Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room. 3 if you’re weird. Point being, it takes more angles to house a decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ll summarize my diatribe by saying the moment you hear of people that simply can not afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number it ’ s time to reconsider your exposure . 2018 I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio ‘ s hedge against inflation . I got push back “ what inflation ” . my rebuttal was and has always been that we don ’ t invest solely based on what ’ s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude . inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises . rates were near zero and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same . right around the time silver crossed the $ 40 range I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buyinginvesting in silver . it seemed to be all the rage . many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position . For them it was fine . but for the rest of the bunch the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal . To what end will you invest in silver where are you hoping to see it why suddenly now Mind you our monetary policy and debt expansion is not_anywhere near the freeandeasy regime we saw between ‘ 18 and ‘ 21 . But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own . They watch what others do see the price run up catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it ’ s ‘ all systems go ’ . My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price . could silver move to $ 100oz surely . could also reach $ 1000 . my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves . if theres a case for $ 100 then there ’ s also a case for $ 50 . the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong what would that loss do to your time horizon the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out . this is also costly . opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis . Having said all that I love silver . It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time . But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio . Taxes on silver gains unlike cap gains on stocks are inescapable . The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure . How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS and does 28 % sound like a fun haircut to get Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run . Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room . 3 if you ’ re weird . Point being it takes more angles to house a decision ."

      "title": "Portfolio Review - Sanity Check",
      "selftext": "Hello! 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio. This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity, with a 20+ year horizon, aiming for long-term growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns. My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap (multiple S&P 500 funds, total market funds, growth funds, etc.). I’m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile. (Roth IRA is handled separately.) Below is how my current allocation looks today. As you’ll see, there’s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures. # Current Portfolio Allocation |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FXAIX|17.40%| |FDLXX|9.99%| |FSKAX|7.83%| |FZILX|5.95%| |SPY|5.90%| |VTI|5.47%| |VUG|5.44%| |FZROX|4.85%| |SOXX|4.61%| |FSELX|4.40%| |FTBFX|4.03%| |FSMDX|3.47%| |QQQ|3.44%| |FBGRX|3.20%| |VOO|3.05%| |FBALX|2.67%| |FCNTX|2.38%| |FSPTX|1.73%| |FPURX|1.57%| |FSPGX|1.19%| |FNILX|0.77%| |IAUM|0.43%| |FTIHX|0.23%| Option 1: ETF-based target allocation I’m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity, portability (in case I ever move away from Fidelity), and tax efficiency in a taxable account. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |VTI|25%| |VOO|25%| |VXUS|20%| |BND|10%| |VUG|8%| |SOXX|5%| |VO|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Option 2: Fidelity-native target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity, this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FSKAX|25%| |FXAIX|25%| |FTIHX|20%| |FTBFX|10%| |FSPGX|8%| |FSELX|5%| |FSMDX|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Looking for feedback on - Does this allocation make sense for 38 / long-term taxable investing? Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts? Would you simplify this further? Thoughts on VTI + VOO together vs a single US equity fund? Not trying to chase returns, mainly want something simple, diversified, and easy to stick with long term. Appreciate any input. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio . This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity with a 20 year horizon aiming for longterm growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns . My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap multiple SP 500 funds total market funds growth funds etc .. I ’ m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile . Roth IRA is handled separately . Below is how my current allocation looks today . As you ’ ll see there ’ s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures . Current Portfolio Allocation Ticker % of Account FXAIX17.40 % FDLXX9.99 % FSKAX7.83 % FZILX5.95 % SPY5.90 % VTI5.47 % VUG5.44 % FZROX4.85 % SOXX4.61 % FSELX4.40 % FTBFX4.03 % FSMDX3.47 % QQQ3.44 % FBGRX3.20 % VOO3.05 % FBALX2.67 % FCNTX2.38 % FSPTX1.73 % FPURX1.57 % FSPGX1.19 % FNILX0.77 % IAUM0.43 % FTIHX0.23 % Option 1 ETFbased target allocation I ’ m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity portability in case I ever move away from Fidelity and tax efficiency in a taxable account . Ticker % of Account VTI25 % VOO25 % VXUS20 % BND10 % VUG8 % SOXX5 % VO5 % FDLXX2 % Option 2 Fidelitynative target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds . Ticker % of Account FSKAX25 % FXAIX25 % FTIHX20 % FTBFX10 % FSPGX8 % FSELX5 % FSMDX5 % FDLXX2 % Looking for feedback on Does this allocation make sense for 38 longterm taxable investing Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts Would you simplify this further Thoughts on VTI VOO together vs a single US equity fund Not_trying to chase returns mainly want something simple diversified and easy to stick with long term . Appreciate any input . Thanks"

      "selftext": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term (50 years). I planned to just put money in the s&p500 monthly, but I learned about small cap value + momentum being theoretically more rewarding. This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean. Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that. This post is for people that find it interesting to look at, but any judgement/advice is also welcome of course. My strategy is the following: Average ROI of US SCV ETF + World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF + World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months. The higher one gets a weight of 70. This is the dynamic factor allocation (relative performance between the factors, cross-factor momentum). The ETF’s are: ZPRV on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF (Italian stock exchange) on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF (English stock exchange) on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IE-domicile. Monthly contributions of €750 (at first, might increase when financial situation changes) with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 70/30 or 30/70 between the factors (SCV and momentum). Realistically between 20-40 and 60-80 is fine. Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 50/50, but +-10 difference is fine. Yearly rebalancing on fixed date (my birthday) if necessary. When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high, I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay. EDIT: based in Europe.",

      "selftext": "Reports have indicated the Trump admin is meeting with home builders and will make an announcement at the world economic forum later this month. Seems like one of the admins priorities will be home building to close home deficits and an executive order is going to be signed. Which home builder stock do you think will benefit the most of the ones below? • Pultegroup (PHM): I think this will be the one to go to. Third largest home builder in volume, but much more importantly Bill Pulte the grandson of the founder is also currently the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Need I say more? • Lennar (LEN): second choice. Want to say this is the second largest homebuilder could be confusing this though. More importantly Stuart Miller (CEO) was part of Trump’s strategic and policy forum in the first admin. Also he hinted at talking to Trump admin late 2025 early this year about affordability/supply (in meetings that included other home builders). • D.R Horton (DHI): A high volume home builder, this company is actually the highest volume builder in the states. But I couldn’t find links to the admin here. Any other thoughts? Thinking of opening a position into lennar or pulte next wk. Edit: • Beacon Roofing Supply (QXO): JBSwerve mentioned QXO, which sells sideboards, windows, and roofing (main product). Kushner on the board",

      "selftext_processed": "Reports have indicated the Trump admin is meeting with home builders and will make an announcement at the world economic forum later this month . Seems like one of the admins priorities will be home building to close home deficits and an executive order is going to be signed . Which home builder stock do you think will benefit the most of the ones below • Pultegroup PHM I think this will be the one to go to . Third largest home builder in volume but much more importantly Bill Pulte the grandson of the founder is also currently the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency . Need I say more • Lennar LEN second choice . Want to say this is the second largest homebuilder could be confusing this though . More importantly Stuart Miller CEO was part of Trump ’ s strategic and policy forum in the first admin . Also he hinted at talking to Trump admin late 2025 early this year about affordabilitysupply in meetings that included other home builders . • D.R Horton DHI A high volume home builder this company is actually the highest volume builder in the states . But I couldn ’ t find links to the admin here . Any other thoughts Thinking of opening a position into lennar or pulte next wk . Edit • Beacon Roofing Supply QXO JBSwerve mentioned QXO which sells sideboards windows and roofing main product . Kushner on the board"

      "selftext": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of micron's memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful. The stock was around 80$. So I picked it up. Sold it after some 20% gains. Did it twice or 3 times. However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not profitable. I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20% gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the (10% annual gain is good) rule. However in the crazy AI era, the bubble vs not bubble is not like any other. The conservative investor should not follow the trends. In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure. However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio. It should be away from tech. As I do not believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices. Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers' stocks. The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron. However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not be justified as there is no race anymore. I think of AI like the space race between superpowers. The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not equal or at least would not be growing (i.e. the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20% or 50% but very small probability that I do not care of). I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000$ from a weighted average of 2000$ scattered on 2.5 years. I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years. I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400$ sold it for 600$ then bought 800$ and sold 1000$. I can not stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else. Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains. So I'll start following the 80% 20% rule, 20 for the trading, 80 for long term investing. What good industries that set for continued growth in next 5-10 years, not financial institutions or consumer like Walmart. I aim for products or services that will improve people lives. I'll then start to look for some innovative companies either in its service/product or its way of doing them in better financial way. This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for people's advice here.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of microns memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful . The stock was around 80 $ . So I picked it up . Sold it after some 20 % gains . Did it twice or 3 times . However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not_profitable . I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20 % gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the 10 % annual gain is good rule . However in the crazy AI era the bubble vs not_bubble is not_like any other . The conservative investor should not_follow the trends . In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure . However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio . It should be away from tech . As I do not_believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices . Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers stocks . The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron . However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not_be justified as there is no_race anymore . I think of AI like the space race between superpowers . The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not_equal or at least would not_be growing i.e . the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20 % or 50 % but very small probability that I do not_care of . I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000 $ from a weighted average of 2000 $ scattered on 2.5 years . I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not_good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years . I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400 $ sold it for 600 $ then bought 800 $ and sold 1000 $ . I can not_stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else . Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains . So Ill start following the 80 % 20 % rule 20 for the trading 80 for long term investing . What good industries that set for continued growth in next 510 years not_financial institutions or consumer like Walmart . I aim for products or services that will improve people lives . Ill then start to look for some innovative companies either in its serviceproduct or its way of doing them in better financial way . This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for peoples advice here ."

      "selftext": "2025 had low transaction volume for home sales, the lowest turnover rate in decades, and the lowest rate of first time buyers EVER. With that being said I’m trying to land on a few housing adjacent plays to buy into in the next few years. I had looked into companies like Wayfair, Stanley decker, shark ninja, RH, and whirlpool (basically any companies that potentially stand to benefit from more people buying homes). One issue I have with Wayfair is it’s priced VERY high right now with a run up of $155% in the past year. Similarly shark ninja is a little bit pricey but undoubtedly has a solid and efficient business plan. Any companies you would recommend diving deeper into? Fully expect that it’ll be a few years before sales volumes really pick up again, but would rather start thinking through which tickers are positioned to make the most out of home sales increasing from all time lows. For reference you’ll see most of the stocks mentioned above had ATHs in 2020-2021; I don’t expect we’d see a buying season like that in at least the next ten years, BUT given a ton of these stocks tanked around low home sales and tariffs there is a run up they’d benefit from.",

      "selftext": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $2.5. There was a -$82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners, likely from ticker collision between $VLN and $VLN Toronto. Because of this, algorithms modeled this company to have <1Y runway after spending $82 Million while in reality they still have $93M cash and $11m in inventory. Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday. Yet algorithms have not caught on yet, as they're still modeling negative EV from -$82M burn (this requires manual correction). Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to -$82M error on Stonegate, Streetwise, and scanners. $VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $255M market cap size. This is not due to company quality and it's definitely not some random micro stock. But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in <1Y runway from $82m burn. This is a extremely mispriced AI & Robotics fabless chipmaker with: \\- Mercedes \\- Samsung \\- Mobileye (EyeQ6) \\- Siemens \\- Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers. $VLN has \\- Zero Debt. \\- $93.5 Million Cash \\- $11 Million + in inventory. \\- \\~$80M+ est. forward revenue \\- 69.1% gross margins on their robotics/machine vision/industrial vertical (growing 40% Y/Y). Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0%. If you want to compare similar companies: \\- Lattice $LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EV/Revenue. \\- Macom $MTSI, trades around 13x and 16.5x. EV/Revenue. Valens trades at: 2.4x. Which looks like a glitch. Even non-premium, 20-30% gross margin, companies trade at 4-5x (more than double current prices). We now see an extreme mispricing of a $NVDA-margin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors. Even trading at a normal 10x EV/revenue (no premium) would be $893.5M/106.34M= \\-> $8.40 from $2.5. This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision.",

There was a $ 82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners likely from ticker collision between $ VLN and $ VLN Toronto . Because of this algorithms modeled this company to have 1Y runway after spending $ 82 Million while in reality they still have $ 93M cash and $ 11m in inventory . Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday . Yet algorithms have not_caught on yet as theyre still modeling negative EV from $ 82M burn this requires manual correction . Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to $ 82M error on Stonegate Streetwise and scanners . $ VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $ 255M market cap size . This is not_due to company quality and its definitely not_some random micro stock . But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in 1Y runway from $ 82m burn . This is a extremely mispriced AI Robotics fabless chipmaker with Mercedes Samsung Mobileye EyeQ6 Siemens Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers . $ VLN has Zero Debt . $ 93.5 Million Cash $ 11 Million in inventory . $ 80M est . forward revenue 69.1 % gross margins on their roboticsmachine visionindustrial vertical growing 40 % YY . Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0 % . If you want to compare similar companies Lattice $ LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EVRevenue . Macom $ MTSI trades around 13x and 16.5x . EVRevenue . Valens trades at 2.4x . Which looks like a glitch . Even nonpremium 2030 % gross margin companies trade at 45x more than double current prices . We now see an extreme mispricing of a $ NVDAmargin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors . Even trading at a normal 10x EVrevenue no premium would be $ 893.5M106.34M $ 8.40 from $ 2.5 . This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision ."

I read some Motley Fool articles and picks, I look at the charts and graphs and 1-year target price info on Yahoo Finance, and I was thinking of getting a Zack's Investment Research subscription to get their list of #1 Strong Buy stocks (They say their #1 buy stock picks have returned about 25% per year since 1988 or something...Maybe that is skewed by a few really big winners and the others are flat. I don't know...) With however many thousands of stocks there are, I would like someone else to do most of the heavy listing and analysis for me, winnowing out the lower quality stocks with less potential, so I can make a more informed, educated selection (guess? gamble?). So what resource do you think provides the best, most accurate, time-tested analysis that you would trust to help you make purchasing decissions?",

What resources do you use to help you pick stocks I read some Motley Fool articles and picks I look at the charts and graphs and 1year target price info on Yahoo Finance and I was thinking of getting a Zacks Investment Research subscription to get their list of 1 Strong Buy stocks They say their 1 buy stock picks have returned about 25 % per year since 1988 or something ... Maybe that is skewed by a few really big winners and the others are flat . I dont know ... With however many thousands of stocks there are I would like someone else to do most of the heavy listing and analysis for me winnowing out the lower quality stocks with less potential so I can make a more informed educated selection guess gamble . So what resource do you think provides the best most accurate timetested analysis that you would trust to help you make purchasing decissions"

      "selftext": "Hey I will try to keep this brief, as of last week, a private investor(a) have bought up almost of the free float of NEGG. There are now about 20k shares of the float not held by insiders. Retail long has at least a few hundred thousand. And the currently reported short count (fintel) is about 270k. It could well be more of we factor in the institutional holds. The company has previously been off the boil, but has cleared debt, has been looking to expand and is developing AR PC gaming experiences. Oh and PC components have gone up faster than any other 'asset' due to the whole data center thing leading to market scarcity. RAM up 600% for example. Financials for NEGG are annually reported and are not due until March, but a turnaround to profitability is expected. Given the over subscription of the float, and outstanding short positions, things could get very interesting. Things may happen sooner than the business case evidence. But business turn around and timing is another factor that sets a positive outlook. If you haven't looked into it and you are interested in market anomalies, I think you may struggle to find tickers with a higher % of insider holds. Of course I am in NEGG and have been since September 25, but I feel like this latest 13D and tiny free float needs to be communicated to those that don't know. Happy to field any questions.",

      "selftext": "I’ve recently entered the market \\[32M\\] with €10,000 seed and a known budget of €1-2000 per month to invest in these 5 ETFs that have accumulating dividends, the plan is to set this fund up to retire at the age of \\~55 with a portfolio that I can withdraw 4% from per year to live an easy life. The plan is the below allocations using €1000 a month investment. ETF Name and monthly investment: Vanguard FTSE All-World High Dividend UCITS ETF - €350 VanEck Semiconductor UCITS ETF - €250 iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF - €150 iShares Automation & Robotics UCITS ETF - €150 VanEck Defense ETF A USD - €100 Around year 14, invested €168,000: • Portfolio value ≈ €340–360k • 8.6% return ≈ €29-31k • Returns > €12k contributions • Growth now does more work than you Year 25 If you stick with the plan, invested €300,000: • Portfolio value ≈ €1.5-1.7million • 5% return ≈ €75-82k • Returns \\~ € 6,650 per month • dividends far exceed €12k contributions per annum This with the accumulating dividends should provide a portfolio value of €1.63million with €300,000 invested after 25 years. Ideally I’m going to push more than €1000 per month but I need to be considerate that life gets in the way. Finally some generic investing mantra: One Rule for Success. Invest every month. Do not stop during market crashes. Do not change the plan. Time + consistency matter more than market timing. @reddit set reminder for this post in 25 years. See you all there my fellow millionaires.",

The plan is the below allocations using €1000 a month investment . ETF Name and monthly investment Vanguard FTSE AllWorld High Dividend UCITS ETF €350 VanEck Semiconductor UCITS ETF €250 iShares MSCI World Small Cap UCITS ETF €150 iShares Automation Robotics UCITS ETF €150 VanEck Defense ETF A USD €100 Around year 14 invested €168000 • Portfolio value ≈ €340–360k • 8.6 % return ≈ €2931k • Returns €12k contributions • Growth now does more work than you Year 25 If you stick with the plan invested €300000 • Portfolio value ≈ €1.51.7million • 5 % return ≈ €7582k • Returns € 6650 per month • dividends far exceed €12k contributions per annum This with the accumulating dividends should provide a portfolio value of €1.63million with €300000 invested after 25 years . Ideally I ’ m going to push more than €1000 per month but I need to be considerate that life gets in the way . Finally some generic investing mantra One Rule for Success . Invest every month . Do not_stop during market crashes . Do not_change the plan . Time consistency matter more than market timing . set reminder for this post in 25 years . See you all there my fellow millionaires ."

      "selftext": "Over the past couple of years, I started learning about investment and securities. Before then, I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never be able to understand. However, the deeper I go, the more angry and disillusioned I feel. What started as “invest in a company you believe in and grow with it” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement, no matter the method, no matter the ethics. It’s no longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow, it’s about speed, leverage, arbitrage, and squeezing edge out of anything that moves. Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself. Not from creating value. Not from improving products. Just from being faster, more aggressive, more optimised than the next guy. And it’s not just traditional markets. Look at crypto. In theory it was meant to democratise finance. In practice it’s become a playground for: - Rug pulls - Pump-and-dumps - Influencer scams - Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not to build, but to extract. The goal isn’t “grow something useful.” It’s “how do I get mine before everyone else does?” What bothers me most isn’t that some people are greedy, that’s human. It’s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage. If you hesitate, someone else front-runs you. If you care, someone else exploits the gap. At some point, it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose. I know markets are necessary. Capital has to flow. Risk has to be priced. But it feels like we’ve built a hyper-financialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it. And it leaves you wondering: Is this really what “investing” is supposed to be?",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past couple of years I started learning about investment and securities . Before then I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never_be able to understand . However the deeper I go the more angry and disillusioned I feel . What started as “ invest in a company you believe in and grow with it ” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement no_matter the method no_matter the ethics . It ’ s no_longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow it ’ s about speed leverage arbitrage and squeezing edge out of anything that moves . Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself . Not_from creating value . Not_from improving products . Just from being faster more aggressive more optimised than the next guy . And it ’ s not_just traditional markets . Look at crypto . In theory it was meant to democratise finance . In practice it ’ s become a playground for Rug pulls Pumpanddumps Influencer scams Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not_to build but to extract . The goal isn ’ t “ grow something useful. ” It ’ s “ how do I get mine before everyone else does ” What bothers me most isn ’ t that some people are greedy that ’ s human . It ’ s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage . If you hesitate someone else frontruns you . If you care someone else exploits the gap . At some point it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose . I know markets are necessary . Capital has to flow . Risk has to be priced . But it feels like we ’ ve built a hyperfinancialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it . And it leaves you wondering Is this really what “ investing ” is supposed to be"

      "selftext": "Trump has announced that credit card users are being charged interest rates of 20–30% and said he wants to impose a temporary cap of 10% for one year. I wonder how such a move would impact Visa and Mastercard as stocks. At the same time, I’m questioning the premise itself, credit card interest rates are set by issuing banks, not by Visa or Mastercard, which operate payment networks rather than lending businesses. If a rate cap were actually implemented, the direct financial impact would likely fall on banks rather than on Visa or Mastercard. Still, markets often react to headlines before nuance, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see short-term selling pressure on Visa and Mastercard driven by misunderstanding rather than fundamentals.",

I wonder how such a move would impact Visa and Mastercard as stocks . At the same time I ’ m questioning the premise itself credit card interest rates are set by issuing banks not_by Visa or Mastercard which operate payment networks rather than lending businesses . If a rate cap were actually implemented the direct financial impact would likely fall on banks rather than on Visa or Mastercard . Still markets often react to headlines before nuance so I wouldn ’ t be surprised to see shortterm selling pressure on Visa and Mastercard driven by misunderstanding rather than fundamentals ."

I mean I like the platform, why wouldn't I like the stock? Its just like robinhood right (turns out no) AND I am whats called on there a \"popular investor\" which basically means all the noobs who \"know they should invest in something but don't know how to start\" can just \"copy\" me, and they execute all the same trades as me. I have hundreds of people who copy my trades, so I have no idea how much money I have lost people. One of my copiers was clearly a family investing their joint money, they closed their copy down 25% in total after copying me for like 6 months.

I already got rejected from the research track and I’m waiting until April for the applied track results, but I’m worried I’m \"too old\" at 30 compared to the 20-year-olds with no experience they seem to prefer. The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold, and I’m still salty after losing 70% (due to currency devaluation) of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa. Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating, but I’m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k (around 18k USD, so 30% of my holdings at current prices) if I finally get the green light.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR around 60k USD in total Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions also I dont really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs . this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in a few months if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . Also currently no_income but in the future Id probably do at least 50 % SP500 then rest is depends on how the market is could be more sp500 .

I already got rejected from the research track and I ’ m waiting until April for the applied track results but I ’ m worried I ’ m too old at 30 compared to the 20yearolds with no_experience they seem to prefer . The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa . Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating but I ’ m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k around 18k USD so 30 % of my holdings at current prices if I finally get the green light ."

Tech focus: Exposure isn’t just traditional defence primes, but also AI, cyber, drones, space, and autonomous systems. Diversification: Holdings across US, Europe, and allies (e.g. Lockheed, RTX, BAE, Palantir, Thales, Saab). Policy tailwinds: Multi-year government contracts + long procurement cycles = revenue visibility. UCITS / unleveraged: Suitable for long-term holding, unlike single-stock or leveraged ETFs.

What about dividends and capital gains? Is there a point where I should stop reinvesting dividends and capital gains? Is it better to just take the cash and use it for expenses while in retirement? Or let it continue growing and only cash out as needed?",

      "title": "Crypto DATs are literally legal ponzi machine (BMNR / SBET / MSTR)",
      "selftext": "Don't get me wrong, I'm not against any digital asset treasuries (DATs), it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and it's legal. (Disclosure: I even have some position in some DATs) The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago, I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 2\\~3 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock, and I dismissed it as one of the \"stupid things in crypto\". But two weeks ago, I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20% discount on NAV, that piqued my interest, because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me, so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs, and if the opportunity is real or a trap. After some studying, and cut through all the bullshit terminology, I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is. # What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase, it'll probably be \"market irrationality harvester\", \"idiot harvesting machine\" or \"wealth transfer machine\" (transfer from idiot ofc). These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy, looks like a fund, but does not follow funds regulation or structure, a fund that has less transparency requirement, less protection for their shareholders (that's the point, it has to harvest the idiots). What the entire management do is very simple, they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean, ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock. The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type: * People who buy when the stock is below NAV (not necessarily mean they'll profit, more on this later.) * People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV (not necessarily mean they will lose money too! but **majority of them DO lose money**, they are the target to be harvested, or to be transfer wealth from.) Let's start with the simple one, why people who buy above the NAV will not necessarily lose money? Here's the ponzi part kicks in, because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV. To be fair though, many who bought above NAV knew this, just like in Ponzi, many know what they are getting into, but they just think they'll not be the last one holding the bag. (aka \"there'll be a greater fool\") Then there's people who buy the stock below NAV, these are usually people that'll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward, usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV, but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales, more on it next. # Accretive & Dilutive of DATs. Let me use a simple example, there's a stock with 1 million outstanding share, the entire value of the company is $1mil, so the NAV is exactly $1. In this example we'll assume the underlying asset value has no change and stay constant. Next, the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing, the stock price is now trading at $2 but the NAV stay unchanged, so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $2, raised $2mil and bought $2mil of underlying asset. Now there's 2 million outstanding shares, with $3mil underlying asset, the NAV of each share now becomes $1.5, this is **accretive**. Then some bad news happen, the stock price crashing from $2 to $1.5, then someone bought at $1.5, then it continue to crash to $1. At this point, the NAV is still $1.5, but the price of the stock is $1. For buyer at 3 difference price point * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.5 so they are fine for now. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, but they also know the NAV of the stock is $1.5 so they think they'll be fine. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, they figured out the NAV is $1.5 still below their entry price, they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock, to the same premium level for them to get out. Now for some reason, the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV, so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $1 price, raised another $1mil and bought the asset. Now there's 3 million outstanding share with $4mil underlying asset, the NAV becomes $1.33, falls from the previous $1.5 and this is **dilutive**. When this happen, all existing shareholders are equally harmed: * People who bought early at $1, there's no nominal lost for them yet, their stock NAV is $1.33, falling from previous $1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive, the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price. * People who bought at $1.5, there's a nominal lost of $0.5 for them, now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $1.33 they are still in lost, they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven. * People who bought at $2, they lost $1 or half of their investment, the chance of them breakeven further decreases, as they require and even higher premium, and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point. So in conclusion, when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV, people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested. When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV, which happened before, and will likely happen again, all shareholders lose value in their share, the damage depends on what discount/premium level they got it. # Interest of the management is not aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part, unlike most of the Asset-based ETFs, there's a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premium/discount to keep the price close to the NAV, there's none for such DATs, and they are even worse than close end funds, because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market. The best part is, the management of these DATs doesn't necessarily care about the NAV per share, in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company, regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted. # So is there opportunity? Personally I think it's fine to make some risk calculated bet, especially when there's a deep discount on NAV, but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny, with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when it's dilutive. Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me, it amaze me because I never thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not create any production value at all, and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV, and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders, or the management itself. I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants, the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value, then stock like this should be banned, fined, or force to follow strict fund regulations. But anyway, I am not writing this because I care, I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the \"highly regulated\" stock market.",

      "selftext_processed": "Dont get me wrong Im not_against any digital asset treasuries DATs it just amazed me that this is a thing in stock market and its legal . Disclosure I even have some position in some DATs The first time I heard about MSTR was a few years ago I looked into the NAV and find it puzzling why are people paying 23 times the value of the underlying asset to buy the stock and I dismissed it as one of the stupid things in crypto . But two weeks ago I saw a post on seekingalpha saying BMNR is trading at a 20 % discount on NAV that piqued my interest because any discount sounds like an opportunity to me so I needed to figure it out what the hell are these DATs and if the opportunity is real or a trap . After some studying and cut through all the bullshit terminology I finally able to see it clearly what it actually is . What The Hell is DATs Stock If I have to describe it in one single phrase itll probably be market irrationality harvester idiot harvesting machine or wealth transfer machine transfer from idiot ofc . These DATs are basically public traded companies that are asset heavy looks like a fund but does not_follow funds regulation or structure a fund that has less transparency requirement less protection for their shareholders thats the point it has to harvest the idiots . What the entire management do is very simple they need to hype the price of their stock beyond the NAV through various marketing mean ultimately attract people to pay double or triple of the NAV to buy the stock . The majority of the people who buy the stock has 2 type People who buy when the stock is below NAV not necessarily mean theyll profit more on this later . People who buy the stock when the stock is above NAV not necessarily mean they will lose money too but majority of them DO lose money they are the target to be harvested or to be transfer wealth from . Lets start with the simple one why people who buy above the NAV will not_necessarily lose money Heres the ponzi part kicks in because they sell it for the next idiot that are willing to pay even higher on NAV . To be fair though many who bought above NAV knew this just like in Ponzi many know what they are getting into but they just think theyll not_be the last one holding the bag . aka therell be a greater fool Then theres people who buy the stock below NAV these are usually people thatll less likely to lose money or with calculated risk or reward usually they can make money when the stock price reverse back to the NAV but they can also lose money if the NAV catches up to the discount with dilutive ATM sales more on it next . Accretive Dilutive of DATs . Let me use a simple example theres a stock with 1 million outstanding share the entire value of the company is $ 1mil so the NAV is exactly $ 1 . In this example well assume the underlying asset value has no_change and stay constant . Next the management hyped up the stock with some bullshit marketing the stock price is now trading at $ 2 but the NAV stay unchanged so the company issued 1 million new shares selling at the market price of $ 2 raised $ 2mil and bought $ 2mil of underlying asset . Now theres 2 million outstanding shares with $ 3mil underlying asset the NAV of each share now becomes $ 1.5 this is accretive . Then some bad news happen the stock price crashing from $ 2 to $ 1.5 then someone bought at $ 1.5 then it continue to crash to $ 1 . At this point the NAV is still $ 1.5 but the price of the stock is $ 1 . For buyer at 3 difference price point People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.5 so they are fine for now . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them but they also know the NAV of the stock is $ 1.5 so they think theyll be fine . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment they figured out the NAV is $ 1.5 still below their entry price they need more bullshit from the management to hype the stock to the same premium level for them to get out . Now for some reason the management of the company decided to issue another 1mil share even when the stock is below NAV so new 1mil share issued and sell at the market of $ 1 price raised another $ 1mil and bought the asset . Now theres 3 million outstanding share with $ 4mil underlying asset the NAV becomes $ 1.33 falls from the previous $ 1.5 and this is dilutive . When this happen all existing shareholders are equally harmed People who bought early at $ 1 theres no_nominal lost for them yet their stock NAV is $ 1.33 falling from previous $ 1.5 if the stock continue to be dilutive the NAV can continue to fall below their entry price . People who bought at $ 1.5 theres a nominal lost of $ 0.5 for them now even if the stock price is back to the NAV of $ 1.33 they are still in lost they now needed the marketing to hype the stock to premium NAV to breakeven . People who bought at $ 2 they lost $ 1 or half of their investment the chance of them breakeven further decreases as they require and even higher premium and it becomes more difficult because the people who bought at $ 1.5 would probably sell when the premium reach their breakeven point . So in conclusion when a DATs only do share issuance when the stock is above NAV people who bought above the NAV price are the one likely going to lose money and to be harvested . When a DATs do share issuance when the stock is below NAV which happened before and will likely happen again all shareholders lose value in their share the damage depends on what discountpremium level they got it . Interest of the management is not_aligned with shareholders This is the scariest part unlike most of the Assetbased ETFs theres a clear creation and redemption mechanism that let APs arbitrage on the premiumdiscount to keep the price close to the NAV theres none for such DATs and they are even worse than close end funds because they can issue massive amount of shares at the market . The best part is the management of these DATs doesnt necessarily care about the NAV per share in fact some of their compensation packages are based on growing the total size of the asset for the company regardless of how many new shares are issued and how many shareholders value has been diluted . So is there opportunity Personally I think its fine to make some risk calculated bet especially when theres a deep discount on NAV but I think the bet size has to be controlled and cautiously tiny with clear exit condition such as the company start issue shares when its dilutive . Overall I just find this kind of stuff amaze me it amaze me because I never_thought the market would allow such obvious ponzi like stock that does not_create any production value at all and the only mechanism is to trick people to pay high price over NAV and siphon away their money to benefit some other shareholders or the management itself . I think if the point of SEC is to protect the market participants the point of stock market is to help business raise funds to create more production value then stock like this should be banned fined or force to follow strict fund regulations . But anyway I am not_writing this because I care I just want to share how I find it amazing with the hypocrisy of the highly regulated stock market ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, I posted about my SOFI calls earlier this week, and they printed. This morning I bought $CDE 1/23 $22 calls, and will be buying some longer-term calls next week. CDE made explosive moves today, crushing resistance. I can easily see this hitting $23 within the next couple of weeks, especially if silver holds strong. Here is a DD on the company: Coeur Mining (CDE) closed the day at $20.5, according to VectorVest, they are valued at 32.5/ share. Therefore, they are extremely undervalued. Here is why I like CDE as a hold into 2026: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M.",

      "selftext": "> President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent, in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail. “Please be informed that we will no longer let the American Public be ‘ripped off’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent,” Trump said in a social media post. > He said there would be a one-year cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20. It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress. Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House. > The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an agency that the administration has suggested should not exist and has slashed funding for. Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday. The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November, according to Federal Reserve data, up from 12.9 percent in late 2013.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Friday announced that he would put a temporary cap on credit card interest rates with a limit of 10 percent in line with an idea he floated on the campaign trail . “ Please be informed that we will no_longer let the American Public be ‘ ripped off ’ by Credit Card Companies that are charging Interest Rates of 20 to 30 percent ” Trump said in a social media post . He said there would be a oneyear cap on credit card rates as of Jan. 20 . It is unclear what authority the president could use to impose such a cap without authorization by Congress . Legislation sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders IVt . and cosponsored by Sen. Josh Hawley RMo . would impose a 10 percent cap on credit card rates for five years . Similar legislation has been introduced in the House . The primary regulator with jurisdiction over credit card practices is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau an agency that the administration has suggested should not_exist and has slashed funding for . Acting Director Russell Vought requested funds for the agency on Friday . The average annual percentage rate charged on credit card accounts was 22.3 percent as of November according to Federal Reserve data up from 12.9 percent in late 2013 ."

First in class HBM dominance and NAND. I know its trading near 52 week highs, but I think forward PEG of 0.20x compared to sector median of 1.66x makes it compelling, even as I am trying to diversify away from AI stocks. AMD - I just fucking love Lisa Su. I think she's got a shot of rolling out HPC accelerators to give Nvidia's Vera Rubin some competition. The new Instincts and EPYC CPUs are impressive as well. I know its trades at a premium, but its forward PEG is roughly a 25% discount to the sector overall. ALL - Property and casualty insurance is resilient and inelastic. Near 200% YOY growth, implementing AI smartly, attractive valuation, defensive play. INCY - I already own this, but I'm considering buying more because the valuation is just too good. It's diversifying beyond its main product Jakafi, has lots of insider buybacks, low debt, outperforms sector growth, and excellent margins. B - Although I'm a bit skeptical because of gold's exceptional rise, Barrick is one of the largest and most diversified mining companies and I think other metals still have room to run (I'm especially bullish on copper). Record cash flows have improved their balance sheet, and I think the green energy transition, EVs, and increased interest in precious metals due to global instability will help.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I am 22 years old and have been wanting to start investing for more than a year now. I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

      "selftext": "Meta Platforms announced a major deal to support Oklo and TerraPower, providing power for their AI data centers. We’re talking about a 1.2 GW nuclear park in Ohio. OKLO gapped up at the open, rising nearly 15% to 20% pre-market, though it pulled back during the session. As someone who successfully locked in profits pre-market today, seeing this gap up is bittersweet, but it perfectly validates the 'AI + Nuclear' investment thesis. Meta is actually providing upfront funding and prepaying for power. This transforms OKLO from a 'concept stock' into a real project with a major anchor customer and a clear 2030 roadmap. We’re seeing the whole sector rally, with Vistra (VST) up over 13% on the news. While I’m tempted to jump back in, I won’t chase a 20% gap up. I’m watching for a 'gap fill' move or consolidation around the $105 support level. RSI is definitely showing 'overbought' in the short term, but long-term institutional interest has surged. Anyone else catch this move? Are you holding for triple digits to become the new floor, or taking profits on this Meta-fueled hype?",

OKLO gapped up at the open rising nearly 15 % to 20 % premarket though it pulled back during the session . As someone who successfully locked in profits premarket today seeing this gap up is bittersweet but it perfectly validates the AI Nuclear investment thesis . Meta is actually providing upfront funding and prepaying for power . This transforms OKLO from a concept stock into a real project with a major anchor customer and a clear 2030 roadmap . We ’ re seeing the whole sector rally with Vistra VST up over 13 % on the news . While I ’ m tempted to jump back in I won ’ t chase a 20 % gap up . I ’ m watching for a gap fill move or consolidation around the $ 105 support level . RSI is definitely showing overbought in the short term but longterm institutional interest has surged . Anyone else catch this move Are you holding for triple digits to become the new floor or taking profits on this Metafueled hype"

Sharing observations for others considering similar allocation. Initial concerns: * Volatility significantly higher than equity markets * Tax reporting complexity (every transaction is taxable event) * Custody risk (exchange solvency vs. self-custody operational risk) * Lack of automated investment tools comparable to traditional brokerages Implementation approach: Rather than lump-sum allocation, I structured weekly purchases to smooth volatility impact. Traditional advice suggests DCA for crypto given its cyclical nature. Execution infrastructure. Initial attempts through exchange recurring buys (Coinbase, Kraken) encountered issues: * High fees erode returns on small recurring purchases * Withdrawal restrictions complicate rebalancing * Tax reporting across multiple platforms problematic Transitioned to on-chain execution using Banana Pro. Comparable to setting up automated investment plan through brokerage - specify amount, frequency, asset allocation. Key advantages: 1) Lower transaction costs (especially on Solana) 2) Immediate custody (no exchange risk) 3) Consolidated transaction history 4) Cross-chain portfolio visibility Tax considerations: Every crypto transaction generates tax obligation. Using single platform for automated purchases simplifies cost basis tracking versus manual purchases across multiple exchanges. Results after 6 months: Portfolio behaving as expected - high volatility, but systematic approach prevents emotional decision-making during drawdowns. DCA averaging out market timing risk effectively. For those with small crypto allocation (3-10%), what systematic investment approach are you using? Still primarily through exchange recurring buys, or have you found more efficient execution methods?",

      "selftext": "First off, I’ve already broken my rules set out in post #1, so time to change that. Started the challenge with $50k on Jan 1. First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

First trade was PAA calls got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain . Trade 2 was a ticker that can not be named here . Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out but rules are meant to be broken . Got impatient today and sold them for a $ 10k loss . THEN things got interesting . Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $ 40k into $ 75k that was dumb never_again . Which brings me to LULU . They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed we knew that would happen . LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine see last earnings report . It ’ s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce . Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then . All $ 200 strike no regarded OTMs . Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better . Too much trading in too short of time . Next stop $ 100k with goal of $ 500k by year end ."

      "selftext": "Hello all, Please take a look below at this plan and let me know your feedback. I appreciate you taking the time to time to read it. Context: I’m aiming to grow a $770,000 portfolio to $1,000,000 by Dec 31, 2026. I need a 29.8% total return. I’m balancing an advisor’s conservative S&P 500 anchor with my own high-conviction \"Alpha\" plays in the AI infrastructure and Nuclear sectors. Current Market Condition (Jan 9, 2026): Markets are at ATHs. S&P is testing 6,970. Geopolitical \"relief rallies\" are in full swing, but technicals look overextended. The plan: 1. The Allocation (The 50/50 Barbell) * Invested (50% - $385k): Strike-force deployment once the market hits a 1.5% pullback from today’s highs. * Cash Shield (50% - $385k): Held in SNSXX (3.42% yield) for dip-buying and risk mitigation. | Asset | Ticker | Weight | Amount | Strategy | |---|---|---|---|---| | S&P 500 | VOO | 40% | $154,000 | The Anchor (DRIP ON). | | Nasdaq 100 | QQQM | 20% | $77,000 | The Engine (DRIP ON). | | Nuclear/Uranium | NLR | 20% | $77,000 | The Power Bottleneck (DRIP OFF). | | Semiconductors | SMH | 10% | $38,500 | Sector-wide Speed (DRIP OFF). | | NVIDIA | NVDA | 5% | $19,250 | Pure GPU Alpha (DRIP OFF). | | Broadcom | AVGO | 5% | $19,250 | Custom Silicon Lead (DRIP OFF). | 2. The Rule Structure: * The Wait: No buying until VOO hits $629 or QQQM hits $254. I’m looking for 2 consecutive red days or a CPI-induced sell-off (Jan 15) to enter. * The Scalp (Aggressive): I have a $55k short-term capital loss carryover to use this year. At a 5% gain, I will harvest the profit into SNSXX. * The Runner Rule: For the satellites (NVDA, AVGO, NLR, SMH), I will replace Limit Orders with a 2% Trailing Stop once they hit +5% to capture potential parabolic moves. * The Dip Rule: I have 7 waves of $55,000 in cash. If any asset drops 5% from my strike price, I deploy one wave immediately. * The Phasing: If the market stays green, I deploy $55k into VOO/QQQM every 60 days (skipping April due to midterm election year historical soft patch). 3. Why this hits $1M in 2026 * $17.3k in risk-free SNSXX interest. * $55k in tax-neutralized scalps (thanks to the loss carryover). * $158k required from market growth. With NVDA Rubin cycle and Nuclear energy data center demand accelerating, this is the \"Physical AI\" play. Questions for the community: * Is a 2% Trailing Stop too tight for the 2026 \"vibration\" of chips? * Thoughts on skipping the April 1st phase in a midterm election year? * Am I holding too much cash ($385k) given the 29.8% return hurdle?",

      "selftext": "First, I'm not a financial professional and this is not professional investment advice. I'm just looking broadly at the market and I'm a little concerned. Also, I'm not a VOO for lifer, but I don't hate that strategy. It seems to have worked very well in the past. \\--- The S&P 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe. The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62% of the weight, and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI. To make matters a little more concerning, several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt. Basically, I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued (especially Tesla with its ridiculous \\~300 p/e ratio) and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn. That's why I'm moving significant portions of my holdings to a **revenue-weighted** version of the S&P 500. I'm using Invesco's RWL, but there are many others that are basically the same. While their performances historically are damn near identical, revenue-weighted versions of the S&P 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower. For example, while the **top 10** of the normal S&P 500 make up nearly 40% of the fund, for RWL, the **top 24** make up around that much. Sure, it's going to be pretty similar in the long term, but in the short term, it looks like you're going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive. **Edit: I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically.** Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs, and this is no exception. The comparison is 0.03% for Vanguard and 0.39% for Invesco. While the fees are 13x higher, I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification. Because Vanguard's fee rate is so low, I personally haven't felt the difference yet, but **it is there and it is significant**. If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF, I would move to that one in a heartbeat. **Also, in the past, RWL hasn't performed better in down markets historically.** I think that an AI bubble burst would be different, however. RWL simply has less holdings in AI-forward stocks, meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower.",

      "selftext_processed": "First Im not_a financial professional and this is not_professional investment advice . Im just looking broadly at the market and Im a little concerned . Also Im not_a VOO for lifer but I dont hate that strategy . It seems to have worked very well in the past . The SP 500 as we know it is likely a lot riskier right now than you may believe . The top 10 companies in that 500 company index fund currently make up 39.62 % of the weight and 9 of those 10 are throwing money at AI . To make matters a little more concerning several of them are outpacing their revenue with cap expenditure into AI and funding the expenses using debt . Basically I think that most of those companies are pretty overvalued especially Tesla with its ridiculous 300 pe ratio and they could drop like a rock if the market takes a downturn . Thats why Im moving significant portions of my holdings to a revenueweighted version of the SP 500 . Im using Invescos RWL but there are many others that are basically the same . While their performances historically are damn near identical revenueweighted versions of the SP 500 offer more diversification because the weighting inequality is much lower . For example while the top 10 of the normal SP 500 make up nearly 40 % of the fund for RWL the top 24 make up around that much . Sure its going to be pretty similar in the long term but in the short term it looks like youre going to have a much smoother ride if the market takes a dive . Edit I should be clear about some of the downsides of RWL specifically . Invesco ETFs generally have a much higher fee rate than Vanguard ETFs and this is no_exception . The comparison is 0.03 % for Vanguard and 0.39 % for Invesco . While the fees are 13x higher I personally am okay with the higher fees for greater diversification . Because Vanguards fee rate is so low I personally havent felt the difference yet but it is there and it is significant . If Vanguard made a similarly weighted ETF I would move to that one in a heartbeat . Also in the past RWL hasnt performed better in down markets historically . I think that an AI bubble burst would be different however . RWL simply has less holdings in AIforward stocks meaning the potential for losses in such an event is lower ."

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term. Holding 6455 shares at $129.99 this is not financial advice just my opinion",

The Vision Pro is cool, but it's a niche product, not a mass-market game-changer. Their revenue growth is in the low single digits. It's becoming a value stock, not a growth stock. Google, on the other hand, is an AI powerhouse. Their cloud business is growing at 25%+, and they are monetizing AI across their entire ecosystem (Search, YouTube, Android). They have a clear path to double-digit growth for the next 5 years. The market is finally waking up to this. Here's how I see the new Mag7 hierarchy: 1. Microsoft: The undisputed king. Dominant in cloud (Azure) and enterprise AI. 2. Google: The new #2. The purest AI play with a massive moat. 3. Nvidia: The essential hardware provider. The 'picks and shovels' of the AI gold rush. 4. Amazon: Still a beast in e-commerce and cloud, but facing more competition. 5. Apple: The new 'old tech'. A cash-flow machine, but growth is a question mark. 6. Meta: The wild card. The metaverse is a huge bet. Could be #1 or #7 in 5 years. 7. Tesla: The most volatile. Depends entirely on FSD and robotics. I'm re-weighting my portfolio based on this. I'm trimming my Apple position and adding to Google and Microsoft. I believe the market will continue to reward real AI-driven growth. I have a full valuation model for all 7 of the Mag7 stocks, comparing their growth rates, margins, and P/E ratios. It's how I made this call. Am I crazy for selling Apple? What's your ranking of the Mag7 for the next 5 years?",

      "selftext": "The consensus forecast for 2026 is: GDP growth of 2.5-3%, continued Fed rate cuts, and a \"soft landing\" for the economy.But here's what I think the consensus is missing: Tariff Uncertainty: Trump's tariff policies are a wildcard. If tariffs escalate, inflation could re-caccelerate, forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts. This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama: The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026. If there's a standoff, it could create a mini-crisis. Markets hate uncertainty. Valuation Risk: The S&P 500 is trading at 205% above its long-term trend. That's a historic extreme. While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, mean reversion is a mathematical certainty. The question is when. Geopolitical Escalation: With Trump's aggressive foreign policy (Venezuela, Greenland, etc.), geopolitical risk is elevated. A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction. So, while the consensus is optimistic, I'm cautious. I'm positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025, with potential for a 10-15% correction at some point. What's your base case for 2026? Are you optimistic or cautious? Disclaimer: This is a macro outlook for discussion. If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me, DM me, I will be happy to discuss with everyone",

If tariffs escalate inflation could recaccelerate forcing the Fed to pause or reverse rate cuts . This would be a shock to markets that are pricing in a benign scenario Debt Ceiling Drama The US debt ceiling will likely be a political battle in 2026 . If theres a standoff it could create a minicrisis . Markets hate uncertainty . Valuation Risk The SP 500 is trading at 205 % above its longterm trend . Thats a historic extreme . While the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent mean reversion is a mathematical certainty . The question is when . Geopolitical Escalation With Trumps aggressive foreign policy Venezuela Greenland etc . geopolitical risk is elevated . A major geopolitical event could trigger a sharp market correction . So while the consensus is optimistic Im cautious . Im positioning my portfolio for a scenario where 2026 is more volatile than 2025 with potential for a 1015 % correction at some point . Whats your base case for 2026 Are you optimistic or cautious Disclaimer This is a macro outlook for discussion . If you want to discuss the asset allocation of 2026 with me DM me I will be happy to discuss with everyone"

I assume the dividend is paid to who holds the stack on the day if dividend payment not_who held it prior to this date Therefore taking aise regular market price fluctuation I would envision that the price of dividend paying stock should rise gradually till the date the dividend is paid and then drop the day after dividend is paid .

      "selftext": "Hello all. I'm trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online. Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info. I'm mostly an invest-and-forget kind of investor, but do play with options a little just for fun (options buy would typically be less than 0.1% of my total investments). For my options \"play\" I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade, which I've had for a couple of decades at least. In ETrade I could sell a position (stock or options) and immediately use that money to buy something else. I moved that account to Schwab (much more modern interface and some nice research tools), and found out I can't do that - I can't spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles. WTF? Is that really a common thing? I'm fairly certain I can sell/buy immediately in my Vanguard account too, but I don't trade actively enough to really say for sure - mostly mutual funds there, so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway. I just never realized, I guess. I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab, then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no interest (if it happens same-day). This was stated in a reddit comment by someone, but I can't find that info in any Schwab documents, so I'm not sure how much to trust it. I didn't set up margin on that account, because I don't want to actually borrow to invest, but maybe ETrade really worked through margin, and I just didn't know? A little more backstory, and I'm hoping I didn't make a rash move: I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation, as right now I've got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies. I'm stuck with two of those (employer-driven), one of which is Fidelity, and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity. ETrade keeps getting moved/bought, and doesn't keep their interface very up-to-date so it just feels old and clunky (and sometimes just doesn't work, although that seems to have been improving lately). Plus, simplifying by having fewer companies would be good. Unfortunately, Fidelity customer service really pissed me off, and they were utterly incompetent - I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved - online didn't work, talking to customer service didn't work, they put in a tech support ticket, and that didn't work, they sent me paper forms but then I'd need to find a place to print and sign... it was a mess. Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes, including the account transfer request, which settled in less than a week. Yay! No simplification for me, however (one company swapped out for another new one, albeit one with a nicer trading platform), and I probably didn't investigate carefully enough -- I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service, which is a bad reason to make a decision. Vanguard would have been easy, but if I move retirement accounts there (possible) I'd have 99% of my assets with one company, which I'm trying to avoid. And their trading platform is terrible. Ugh. It shouldn't be this complicated....",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello all . Im trying to understand something and am having a hard time finding clear information online . Hopefully someone here can point me to some good info . Im mostly an investandforget kind of investor but do play with options a little just for fun options buy would typically be less than 0.1 % of my total investments . For my options play I have always used my Roth IRA with ETrade which Ive had for a couple of decades at least . In ETrade I could sell a position stock or options and immediately use that money to buy something else . I moved that account to Schwab much more modern interface and some nice research tools and found out I cant do that I cant spend the proceeds of a sale until the sale settles . WTF Is that really a common thing Im fairly certain I can sellbuy immediately in my Vanguard account too but I dont trade actively enough to really say for sure mostly mutual funds there so I have to wait for the end of the day for the sale to happen anyway . I just never_realized I guess . I saw something that says if I enable margin trading at Schwab then I can buy immediately on margin and when the sale settles it will close that margin loan and there will be no_interest if it happens sameday . This was stated in a reddit comment by someone but I cant find that info in any Schwab documents so Im not_sure how much to trust it . I didnt set up margin on that account because I dont want to actually borrow to invest but maybe ETrade really worked through margin and I just didnt know A little more backstory and Im hoping I didnt make a rash move I was trying to simplify my overall investment situation as right now Ive got investments in various accounts over 5 different companies . Im stuck with two of those employerdriven one of which is Fidelity and my original thought was to move my Roth from ETrade to Fidelity . ETrade keeps getting movedbought and doesnt keep their interface very uptodate so it just feels old and clunky and sometimes just doesnt work although that seems to have been improving lately . Plus simplifying by having fewer companies would be good . Unfortunately Fidelity customer service really pissed me off and they were utterly incompetent I tried for over 3 weeks to get that account moved online didnt work talking to customer service didnt work they put in a tech support ticket and that didnt work they sent me paper forms but then Id need to find a place to print and sign ... it was a mess . Schwab account was set up in less than 10 minutes including the account transfer request which settled in less than a week . Yay No_simplification for me however one company swapped out for another new one albeit one with a nicer trading platform and I probably didnt investigate carefully enough I set it up mostly because I was fed up with the incompetence of Fidelity customer service which is a bad reason to make a decision . Vanguard would have been easy but if I move retirement accounts there possible Id have 99 % of my assets with one company which Im trying to avoid . And their trading platform is terrible . Ugh . It shouldnt be this complicated ...."

      "selftext": "I am a U.S. citizen living in Germany. This is nice for many reasons, but causes some real headaches for investment. Long story short, normal U.S. brokers won't let me buy ETFs etc. without a US address, and if I buy the same in Germany I will be double-taxed into oblivion. The U.S. taxes citizens regardless of where they live, and disincentives for \"passive foreign income\" screw expats over. However, buying individual stocks and bonds is not \"passive\" and therefore avoids the double taxation problem. I understand this as a loser's game and would vastly prefer the buy-and-forget index fund approach, but that's not an option for me. So my questions: * Is it possible to \"simulate\" an index fund by simply buying a large quantity of individual stocks and bonds? Or would this take a life-consuming amount of effort to do without massive risk? * Am I better off just parking my money in bonds or bond-like accounts (Raisin etc.)? * Are there other reasonable investment approaches that anyone in a similar situation has taken? **TLDR** I'm hoping to approximate as closely as I can the \"normal\" investing approach that a working person in the USA would take, but I have to do so without \"passive\" index funds.",

My main motivation was exposure to consumer credit without being fully correlated with equity markets. What I learned pretty quickly is that P2P is not “passive income” in the true sense. You still need to watch loan originators, understand how buyback works, and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes. On the positive side, cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface. On the negative side, platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns. Today I keep P2P as a single-digit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding. I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure of you are using it.",

My main motivation was exposure to consumer credit without being fully correlated with equity markets . What I learned pretty quickly is that P2P is not_ “ passive income ” in the true sense . You still need to watch loan originators understand how buyback works and accept that liquidity can disappear when market sentiment changes . On the positive side cash flow is more predictable than stocks and volatility feels lower on the surface . On the negative side platform risk is very real and trust matters more than headline returns . Today I keep P2P as a singledigit percentage of my total portfolio and treat it as a satellite allocation rather than a core holding . I am curious how others here structure their P2P exposure of you are using it ."

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

      "selftext_processed": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation . The company is executing a rollup strategy in building products distribution an extremely large fragmented and underdigitized industry . The investment case is less about shortterm housing cycles and more about disciplined MA operational improvement and longterm compounding . QXO operates in building materials distribution with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products . It supplies contractors with products such as shingles insulation siding waterproofing and related materials . Key characteristics of the industry $ 800B total addressable market Highly fragmented dominated by regional operators Low digital penetration Logisticsintensive and relationshipdriven Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital systems and operational discipline . The core of the thesis is management . Brad Jacobs has built multiple largescale industrial platforms United Waste sold for $ 2.5B United Rentals URI became the largest equipment rental company globally XPO Logistics 30x return later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses Jacobs followed a consistent playbook 1 . Enter fragmented industries 2 . Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3 . Standardize operations 4 . Invest heavily in technology 5 . Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."

      "selftext": "So when I was just out of college I opened a Roth IRA through my bank USAA. It made it easy to transfer money into it online. I bought a Vanguard Target Date 2045. USAA decided to get out of that market and transferred everything over to Charles Schwab. I got annoyed and opened a new Roth IRA directly with Vanguard and pretty much forgot about the first one. I have only been contributing to the new account since. I got a statement in the mail and it turns out compound interest works and I find I have about $76k in this orphan Charles Schwab account. I’d like to move that money over to my Vanguard Roth without paying any penalties. Anyone have any idea how I should go about it?",

USAA decided to get out of that market and transferred everything over to Charles Schwab . I got annoyed and opened a new Roth IRA directly with Vanguard and pretty much forgot about the first one . I have only been contributing to the new account since . I got a statement in the mail and it turns out compound interest works and I find I have about $ 76k in this orphan Charles Schwab account . I ’ d like to move that money over to my Vanguard Roth without paying any penalties . Anyone have any idea how I should go about it"

I know that they're not a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there, but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool, one that stuck with me through the years. I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder, and I'm hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not a gift card. As the US Treasury Department no longer issues paper savings bonds, I'm exploring options from non-US countries. (I really do like the physical paper bond certificate, although it looks to be harder to find these days. Canada made a similar transition.) My base requirements in order (only the first one is absolutely required): \\-Legally purchasable by US citizen with no foreign residencies or dual citizenship \\-Minimum purchase amount $100 - $200 USD (open to going higher if needed, but I'd prefer smaller denominations) \\-Paper bonds issued if possible, electronic is fine but I'm sentimental. \\-Generally stable government in decent financial health, although my risk / reward tolerance is pretty high. Open to developing countries. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I recognize that this tradition is antiquated, but I think it's sweet and nostalgic. Thanks for taking a look.",

KO generates \\~$10B+ in annual FCF, has pricing power globally, and is a dividend aristocrat. **Valuation:** Trading \\~23x earnings, roughly in line with historical averages. Dividend yield \\~3%. **Catalysts:** Rate cuts, defensive rotation, pricing increases in emerging markets. **Risks:** Strong USD impacts international revenue, declining soda consumption in developed markets. **Position:** 500 shares @ 67.45 Not expecting moonshots — just steady returns (even a Swing trade is fine as long as I make small profit). Position attached. Who's with me?",

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and I'm shorting the fucking Naira",
      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections .

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

      "selftext": "Hear me out, not a huge fire sale after today's Goldman Sachs spooking but might not be a bad entry. Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "Hear me out not_a huge fire sale after todays Goldman Sachs spooking but might not_be a bad entry . Long SOFI although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $ 27 to $ 24 they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not_be offloading SOFI from their portfolios which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors . On the other hand Barclays increased target price from $ 24 to $ 28 . At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the SP 500 . Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30th expected revenue of $ 985.4 million and profit of $ 0.12 per share . Q3 revenue of $ 950 million beat analysts ’ previous estimates of $ 895 million . So far this year SOFI has risen 72 % . Predicted high for this year is $ 38 with a low of $ 12 . I ’ m looking for a entry point around $ 26.90 which after today ’ s offloading might not_be a bad spot as I dont believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th thoughts"
