It’s increasingly looking like a Berkshire Hathaway–style capital allocator for the digital economy, with massive cash generation, zero balance-sheet stress, and a real narrative + distribution edge. 1. Radical transparency (this matters more than people think) 2. The “Alchemy of 5%” is closer than most realize 3. Staking economics are already staggering 4. ETH appreciation turns this into a cash machine 5. Moonshots with asymmetric distribution The MrBeast investment is far more strategic than it looks 6.

      "selftext": "I’m 26 and just recently started taking investing seriously on my own, and I’m feeling a mix of excitement and regret that I’m trying to process. I do have a 401k through work, so it’s not like I had zero exposure to investing. But if I’m being honest, I never really felt like I was investing for myself. I just contributed, picked a default option, and didn’t think about it much. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally built a real budget, automated my savings, opened a Roth IRA, and started consistently investing outside of my job. For the first time, I actually feel in control of my money instead of just letting things happen. That part feels really good. At the same time, I keep catching myself looking backward. I see certain stocks or ETFs with massive long-term returns and my brain immediately goes to “I had money back then, why didn’t I invest on my own?” I know logically that hindsight is 20/20 and that I couldn’t have known what would take off, but emotionally it still feels like FOMO mixed with being hard on myself for not starting sooner. I guess I’m posting because I want to hear from people who’ve been through this phase. Did you feel regret or second-guessing when you started taking investing seriously outside of a 401k? How did you stop comparing where you are now to what could have been and just focus on building forward? I’m committed to staying consistent and playing the long game. I just don’t want hindsight regret to mess with something positive I’m finally building.",

I just contributed picked a default option and didn ’ t think about it much . Over the past couple of weeks I finally built a real budget automated my savings opened a Roth IRA and started consistently investing outside of my job . For the first time I actually feel in control of my money instead of just letting things happen . That part feels really good . At the same time I keep catching myself looking backward . I see certain stocks or ETFs with massive longterm returns and my brain immediately goes to “ I had money back then why didn ’ t I invest on my own ” I know logically that hindsight is 2020 and that I couldn ’ t have known what would take off but emotionally it still feels like FOMO mixed with being hard on myself for not_starting sooner . I guess I ’ m posting because I want to hear from people who ’ ve been through this phase . Did you feel regret or secondguessing when you started taking investing seriously outside of a 401k How did you stop comparing where you are now to what could have been and just focus on building forward I ’ m committed to staying consistent and playing the long game . I just don ’ t want hindsight regret to mess with something positive I ’ m finally building ."

Financially the company also looks good overall with growing revenue and net income as well as very low debt. However, I’m still skeptical of this valuation by virtue of comparing to Meta. Even Meta only had a P/E in the 70-120 range in its first few years post-IPO with a highest post-IPO P/E of 118. It’s just hard to believe that Reddit will be able to attract users at the same rate as early Meta. What do you think? Is there factors I’m missing?",

      "title": "Three reasons Lilly's orforglipron will end up being as effective as Novo's Wegovy pill",
      "selftext": "Reason 1.) Wegovy pill's 16.6% weight loss has to be taken into context. That number comes from the OASIS-4 trial which only had 307 patients, 79% were female, and 92% were white. By comparison, the ATTAIN-1 trial for orforglipron had 3127 patients, 64% female, and 57% white. In orfo's phase 2 they achieved 13.5% weight loss at 36 weeks. That study had 272 patients, 59% female, 91% white. There is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs. So given the small amount of people in the trial, and the fact that there was an over-representation of the most responsive patient type, one can see how the deck was stacked in their favor to get that 16.6% number. And one can see how this won't be representative of a global population. Reason 2.) We actually have a head-to-head trial in ACHIEVE-3. Yes it was in a diabetic population, but that's a good thing, because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss. In ACHIEVE-3, if we take out the higher 36mg dose of orfo, we can still see that the 12mg orfo dose (6.7% weight loss) beat the 14mg sema dose (5.3%). Novo did their own diabetic trial for oral sema in PIONEER PLUS and lo and behold they got 4.7% weight loss for 14mg, and 8.2% for 25mg and 9.6% for 50mg. compare that to the 9.2% weight loss from 36mg orfo and all the data suggests orfo will be as good, if not even better, than oral sema (at the least in diabetics). Reason 3.) Results of the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.7/2.4mg to orfo 36mg, they gained back a whopping 1% of their weight. In contrast, the Zepbound 10/15mg arm of the study gained back 5% of their weight. The strangest number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial. If you average it out, napkin math says it's 16% weight loss. This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing. In conclusion, when you look further and further into the data, we will arrive at a logical assertion, that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number. Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world.",

      "selftext_processed": "Reason 1 . Wegovy pills 16.6 % weight loss has to be taken into context . That number comes from the OASIS4 trial which only had 307 patients 79 % were female and 92 % were white . By comparison the ATTAIN1 trial for orforglipron had 3127 patients 64 % female and 57 % white . In orfos phase 2 they achieved 13.5 % weight loss at 36 weeks . That study had 272 patients 59 % female 91 % white . There is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs . So given the small amount of people in the trial and the fact that there was an overrepresentation of the most responsive patient type one can see how the deck was stacked in their favor to get that 16.6 % number . And one can see how this wont be representative of a global population . Reason 2 . We actually have a headtohead trial in ACHIEVE3 . Yes it was in a diabetic population but thats a good thing because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss . In ACHIEVE3 if we take out the higher 36mg dose of orfo we can still see that the 12mg orfo dose 6.7 % weight loss beat the 14mg sema dose 5.3 % . Novo did their own diabetic trial for oral sema in PIONEER PLUS and lo and behold they got 4.7 % weight loss for 14mg and 8.2 % for 25mg and 9.6 % for 50mg . compare that to the 9.2 % weight loss from 36mg orfo and all the data suggests orfo will be as good if not_even better than oral sema at the least in diabetics . Reason 3 . Results of the ATTAINMAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.72.4mg to orfo 36mg they gained back a whopping 1 % of their weight . In contrast the Zepbound 1015mg arm of the study gained back 5 % of their weight . The strangest number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial . If you average it out napkin math says its 16 % weight loss . This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing . In conclusion when you look further and further into the data we will arrive at a logical assertion that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number . Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world ."

That’s why physical silver around the world is being bought up and upcharged in every country. Once that continues to dry up, you are going to wish you would have bought >$100",

That ’ s why physical silver around the world is being bought up and upcharged in every country . Once that continues to dry up you are going to wish you would have bought $ 100"

Adobe, Forward PE of 13 and everyone uses it (also most likely to integrate AI, likely hug rally on that) PayPal, Forward PE of 9. As a business owner online my sales went up 20 percent once I offered a PayPal. In addition who doesn’t use Venmo. LMT, US military backed (they’re double the budget) or also ticker Hii. US is definitely preparing for something so military will benefit MDLZ, Cadbury,Oreos Etc. significantly undervalued due to High Milk,Eggs,Cacao prices that have fallen significantly. They’re set to kill earnings and their PE is 10. TDD, financials are amazing, they maximize ROI as a broker for many businesses. They’re not going anywhere and have had a significant overcorrection. NU is a Brazilian Bank that’s rapidly expanding with great value Devon energy and Oxy-Pet for Oil! Gild and BMY for healthcare picks This is very unpopular today because everyone wants to get rich quick. I read the financials,Balance sheets and look for Margin of safety. When you look at tech you realize AI stocks are mostly gambling at this moment and significantly overvalued. It always ends when people least expect it, I did 80 percent last year. My tech stocks went stupid. Mr Market gave me an offer that was too good. Don’t become desensitized to AI Tech Companies Absurd valuations. Here’s something you should really Really understand about stocks. Do Not Overpay. That means you need to understand financials. 95 percent of retail lose because they think they’re talented and geniuses because the stock goes up. They Lose 95 percent of the time OVER the COURSE of a DECADE because Arrogance->feel justified because price increases-> start to believe they’re better than legends like buffet->Continue investing the same for 5 years. Then they’re left exposed,naked and embarrassed about the ego they had when the NASDAQ crashes 70percent over the course of 3 years like in 2000",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs, adding to the Trump administration’s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S. >Under the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $250 billion investment in the U.S., the Commerce Department said. In exchange, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15%, from 20%, and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America. The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week. >The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China. The Trump administration is attempting to de-escalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S. >The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC, which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy. They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products. >TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion, including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan. >“We’re going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. >Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a long-planned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation. Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly, they say. >TSMC’s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan’s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory, to be seized by force if necessary. >China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently, but some analysts say it wouldn’t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC’s production of chips. That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan, they say. >Under the trade agreement, Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona. The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there. >TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs adding to the Trump administration ’ s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S . Under the agreement Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $ 250 billion investment in the U.S. the Commerce Department said . In exchange the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 % from 20 % and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America . The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week . The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China . The Trump administration is attempting to deescalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S . The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy . They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products . TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan . “ We ’ re going to bring it all over so we become selfsufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors ” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC . Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a longplanned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation . Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly they say . TSMC ’ s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan ’ s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion . China claims the selfruled island as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary . China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently but some analysts say it wouldn ’ t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC ’ s production of chips . That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan they say . Under the trade agreement Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona . The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there . TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $ 56 billion on capital expenditures this year highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips ."

This is life-changing money for me that I haven’t really told anyone about so this is kinda cathartic. No intentions to sell for the next few years and I have another $120K ready to exercise the calls. 🅰️",

How sustainable is increasing 1.5x in a month? And this is not just one sector where stocks reflect the greed of investors, it’s 3 unrelated ones. And while this past month has seen extreme growth, there was a lot of growth in all 3 sectors leading up to this as well. I can’t help but think that this is increasingly a market driven by FOMO and hype. Maybe the exponential growth continues and we see 70% growth the next month. Maybe we crash and everything drops 70%. Maybe suddenly everything flattens out and trends towards their more natural growth (likely under 30% a year).

As part of the agreement, Taiwanese chip and technology companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., and the Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit for these companies. In exchange, the U.S. will limit reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, down from 20%, and commit to zero reciprocal tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients, aircraft components, and some natural resources. Taiwan Semiconductor has bought land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan in an interview on Thursday. “They just bought hundreds of acres adjacent to their property,” Lutnick said. “I’ll let them go through with their board and give them time.” Read more: [",

      "selftext": "Does Google actually gain anything if Gemini isn't branded inside Siri? With the news of the Apple/Google partnership becoming official, there’s a lot of talk about how it will look. Most people assume Apple will bury the Gemini name to keep the \"Siri\" magic alive, but I don’t think that’s realistic. My theory: There has to be Gemini branding in the UI. Here’s why: The \"Why\" for Google: 1. Why would Google trade its most advanced 1.2T parameter model for a reported $1 billion and zero brand recognition? For a company with a $4T market cap, $1B is pocket change. This deal has to be about marketing. 2. User Awareness: If Siri suddenly gets 10x smarter, Google wants that \"halo effect.\" They want Apple users to know it’s Gemini doing the heavy lifting so they don't lose the AI mindshare to OpenAI. 3. The ChatGPT Precedent: Apple already shows \"Powered by ChatGPT\" for certain queries. Why would Google accept anything less? 4. Google's whole motive for this partnership is to get Gemini in front of 2 billion active Apple devices. If there’s no branding, Google achieves nothing but helping their biggest rival catch up. Even if it runs on Apple’s hardware and keeps our data private, I’m willing to bet we see a \"Continue in Gemini\" or \"Gemini results\" tag. 5. Google isn't just a backend provider; they are a brand that needs to win the AI war. They aren't going to be Apple's \"ghostwriter\" for just $1 billion. 6. Google is already not getting the data as per the post by Google on X because of the model running on-device or Apple PCC to upkeep the Apple standard of privacy in the industry Even if the data stays on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC), I bet we’ll see a \"Gemini\" logo or a \"Powered by\" tagline in the Siri response window. What do you guys think? Would Apple really let Google’s brand sit that close to the core of iOS? Edit:- 6th point",

Most people assume Apple will bury the Gemini name to keep the Siri magic alive but I don ’ t think that ’ s realistic . My theory There has to be Gemini branding in the UI . Here ’ s why The Why for Google 1 . Why would Google trade its most advanced 1.2T parameter model for a reported $ 1 billion and zero brand recognition For a company with a $ 4T market cap $ 1B is pocket change . This deal has to be about marketing . 2 . User Awareness If Siri suddenly gets 10x smarter Google wants that halo effect . They want Apple users to know it ’ s Gemini doing the heavy lifting so they dont lose the AI mindshare to OpenAI . 3 . The ChatGPT Precedent Apple already shows Powered by ChatGPT for certain queries . Why would Google accept anything less 4 . Googles whole motive for this partnership is to get Gemini in front of 2 billion active Apple devices . If there ’ s no_branding Google achieves nothing_but helping their biggest rival catch up . Even if it runs on Apple ’ s hardware and keeps our data private I ’ m willing to bet we see a Continue in Gemini or Gemini results tag . 5 . Google isnt just a backend provider they are a brand that needs to win the AI war . They arent going to be Apples ghostwriter for just $ 1 billion . 6 . Google is already not_getting the data as per the post by Google on X because of the model running ondevice or Apple PCC to upkeep the Apple standard of privacy in the industry Even if the data stays on Apple ’ s Private Cloud Compute PCC I bet we ’ ll see a Gemini logo or a Powered by tagline in the Siri response window . What do you guys think Would Apple really let Google ’ s brand sit that close to the core of iOS Edit 6th point"

      "selftext": "The FT argues that the AI-driven surge in data center power demand is accelerating interest in small modular reactors, with large tech companies increasingly signing direct deals with SMR developers to secure reliable, zero-emission, on-site power. Meta is highlighted as a major mover, prepaying for output from up to eight TerraPower Natrium reactors and up to 16 Oklo Aurora reactors, making it one of the largest prospective corporate buyers of nuclear energy. However, the article emphasizes that despite the momentum, SMRs will not materially solve near-term power needs: announced data center–SMR deals are estimated to deliver less than 4GW by 2030 versus potential U.S. data center demand of ~20GW. Long build times remain a constraint, with historical SMR projects often taking close to a decade, though proponents argue SMRs offer advantages in financing, grid integration, and long-term scalability. The author concludes that nuclear’s real value is scale rather than speed, positioning SMRs as a post-2030 solution, while near-term clean energy goals will rely more on extending, uprating, and restarting existing nuclear plants.",

They seem like they are an interesting way to get some returns, perhaps as a part of a balanced dividend portfolio. *And* \\- one of the real selling points is that it is largely disconnected from any other real market. It's just mother nature, and accounting for risk appropriately. If the global stock market breaks down, or gold, or bonds, or housing, or whatever ... those things often tug and pull at other investment sectors as well. But the # of hurricanes that will hit the Caribbean this year has nothing to do with whether we're in an AI bubble or not, how lopsided the S&P is to the Mag7, etc. Symbol: ILS",

They seem like they are an interesting way to get some returns perhaps as a part of a balanced dividend portfolio . And one of the real selling points is that it is largely disconnected from any other real market . Its just mother nature and accounting for risk appropriately . If the global stock market breaks down or gold or bonds or housing or whatever ... those things often tug and pull at other investment sectors as well . But the of hurricanes that will hit the Caribbean this year has nothing_to do with whether were in an AI bubble or not_how lopsided the SP is to the Mag7 etc . Symbol ILS"

      "selftext": "Today's Key Takeaway: TSM recently announced capital expenditure guidance exceeded market forecasts, sending a powerful signal across the entire semiconductor supply chain. This exemplifies the classic bullwhip effect: demand from end markets (AI/data centers, advanced process nodes) first materializes at foundries, then propagates upstream with amplified intensity， now beginning to impact equipment suppliers. Foundries are locking in capacity ahead of schedule Equipment manufacturers (lithography, etching, deposition, inspection) will see significantly improved order visibility The industry cycle is shifting from “inventory digestion” to capacity expansion, at least in cutting-edge segments This isn't a miraculous rebound in smartphone demand， it stems from AI-driven increases in process density and capital expenditure per wafer. Even with moderate shipment growth, process complexity continues to climb. Market positioning questions: Foundries vs. equipment suppliers? Front-end equipment vs. back-end/advanced packaging? Or has the market already priced in expectations? The equipment sector may harbor secondary leverage effects.",

      "selftext": "So I just started leasing a car and it fits well into my budget and has helped me put off taking out a loan or using all my savings to pay for a car. I have 3 years to save up money for when my lease ends to either buy that car or go buy a different car. I currently work a job where I have a salary, that covers all of my bills with a little left over after (maybe $500/mo), and a partial commission that helps me earn maybe an extra $100-300 a month on average. I would like to start saving a little every month so when these 3 years are up, I have a good amount saved for my future car purchase. I was thinking about making an additional account on my Sofi app for just this and investing in probably something pretty safe like ETFs. I'm decently versed in investing, so I don't need advice on what to invest in or whatever. My main question is, are there ways to avoid a bunch of fees when I go to take that money out in 3 years? Or will I just have to pay capital gains tax or something? I've never taken money out of my investment accounts before so I have no idea what that process is like. Thanks!",

      "title": "TSMC earnings target up to $56B in 2026 capex and ~30% revenue growth, boosting the AI outlook. Pre-market: TSM +5%, ASML +7%",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $56 billion in capital spending for 2026, a stronger-than-anticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom. >Asia’s most valuable company expects expenditures of $52 billion to $56 billion this year, up at least a quarter from 2025. It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30% in 2026, faster than the average analyst estimate. Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6% to a record in Europe, sending its market value beyond $500 billion. >The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that’s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators. It’s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending. TSMC — Nvidia’s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout, most notably in the US, to sate future demand. >“You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst’s question on a conference call. “We’re investing $52 billion to $56 billion in capex, right? If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.” >Click here for a liveblog on the results. >TSMC reported NT$505.7 billion ($16 billion) in net income for the December quarter, beating the average estimate. That’s off previously reported sales of $33.1 billion in the period, helping the company surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025. >Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot. That’s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su, who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again. >“TSMC’s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. >The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips, now surpassing $1 trillion in planned expenditures, has helped TSMC achieve more than 30% annual sales growth over the past two years. But it may also hamper some parts of the company’s business. >An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025, when manufacturers prioritized premium high-bandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips. That’s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices. Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year. >Hsinchu-based TSMC still relies on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc.’s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business. The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026: Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6%. >On Thursday, Wei said his company won’t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as high-end smartphones are still selling well. >TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan. It’s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $165 billion in the US. >It’s also building plants in Japan and Germany, propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home. Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “close the gap” in supply versus demand.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $ 56 billion in capital spending for 2026 a strongerthananticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom . Asia ’ s most valuable company expects expenditures of $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion this year up at least a quarter from 2025 . It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30 % in 2026 faster than the average analyst estimate . Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6 % to a record in Europe sending its market value beyond $ 500 billion . The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that ’ s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators . It ’ s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending . TSMC — Nvidia ’ s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout most notably in the US to sate future demand . “ You ’ re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not_I ’ m also very nervous about it ” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst ’ s question on a conference call . “ We ’ re investing $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion in capex right If we don ’ t do it carefully that ’ d be a big disaster for TSMC. ” Click here for a liveblog on the results . TSMC reported NT $ 505.7 billion $ 16 billion in net income for the December quarter beating the average estimate . That ’ s off previously reported sales of $ 33.1 billion in the period helping the company surpass $ 100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025 . Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot . That ’ s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again . “ TSMC ’ s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term ” said Gary Tan a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments . The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips now surpassing $ 1 trillion in planned expenditures has helped TSMC achieve more than 30 % annual sales growth over the past two years . But it may also hamper some parts of the company ’ s business . An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025 when manufacturers prioritized premium highbandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips . That ’ s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices . Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year . Hsinchubased TSMC still relies on Apple Inc. ’ s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc. ’ s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business . The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026 Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6 % . On Thursday Wei said his company won ’ t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as highend smartphones are still selling well . TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan . It ’ s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $ 165 billion in the US . It ’ s also building plants in Japan and Germany propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home . Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “ close the gap ” in supply versus demand ."

      "title": "GoGold the undercover silver miner",
      "selftext": "GoGold is a silver miner cosplaying as a gold miner, especially at $90/oz silver. Here’s the breakdown: The Los Ricos mines have 115 million ounces of payable silver (47M at Los Ricos South and 68M at Los Ricos North), as opposed to 665k ounces of gold (424k at Los Ricos South and 221k at Los Ricos North). The AISC (all in sustaining cost), which is basically the average cost to produce one ounce of silver and keep the mine running long term, is only around $10–12 for both mines. That makes it one of the very few Tier-1 silver assets in the world, with decent margins when the feasibility study was conducted at sub $30/oz silver and insane margins above $90/oz. Yet despite being a Tier-1 silver asset, while the silver price has been going nuts and every silver miner on the market has been going to the moon, GoGold has been lagging behind with the gold miners. Why? Because it’s relatively tiny in terms of market cap ($886M which is nuts if you’ve done a NAV calc at $90 silver), and most people seem to think it’s a gold miner… probably because it’s named “GoGold.” Finally, while most development stage miners are cash black holes, GoGold is already profitable and generating positive cash flow due to its tailings project. That’s a great sign in an industry full of executives who don’t seem to believe their mines ever need to be profitable. Anyway, if you feel like you missed the silver run up, this is a Tier-1 silver asset hiding in plain sight that hasn’t moved with silver.",

      "selftext_processed": "GoGold is a silver miner cosplaying as a gold miner especially at $ 90oz silver . Here ’ s the breakdown The Los Ricos mines have 115 million ounces of payable silver 47M at Los Ricos South and 68M at Los Ricos North as opposed to 665k ounces of gold 424k at Los Ricos South and 221k at Los Ricos North . The AISC all in sustaining cost which is basically the average cost to produce one ounce of silver and keep the mine running long term is only around $ 10–12 for both mines . That makes it one of the very few Tier1 silver assets in the world with decent margins when the feasibility study was conducted at sub $ 30oz silver and insane margins above $ 90oz . Yet despite being a Tier1 silver asset while the silver price has been going nuts and every silver miner on the market has been going to the moon GoGold has been lagging behind with the gold miners . Why Because it ’ s relatively tiny in terms of market cap $ 886M which is nuts if you ’ ve done a NAV calc at $ 90 silver and most people seem to think it ’ s a gold miner… probably because it ’ s named “ GoGold. ” Finally while most development stage miners are cash black holes GoGold is already profitable and generating positive cash flow due to its tailings project . That ’ s a great sign in an industry full of executives who don ’ t seem to believe their mines ever need to be profitable . Anyway if you feel like you missed the silver run up this is a Tier1 silver asset hiding in plain sight that hasn ’ t moved with silver ."

      "selftext": "Across the U.S. Suboxone prescriptions are rapidly increasing as states implement restrictions or outright bans on 7-hydroxymitragynine (7OH). As access to 7OH becomes more limited, many users are swiftly transitioned to generic Suboxone as part of their treatment plan. If you delve into the Quitting 7OH thread, you’ll notice a significant number of users describing their placement on Suboxone. For many, stopping 7OH serves as a temporary bridge to Suboxone, while for others, it becomes a long-term solution. This situation raises a serious public health concern. Withdrawal from 7OH is often described as more severe and destabilizing compared to withdrawal from traditional prescription opioids, including extreme sensory disturbances. This severity is particularly concerning given that 7OH has been widely accessible through gas stations and smoke/vape shops with minimal regulation. Another overlooked aspect is the diverse group of individuals affected. Many users are not stereotypical “drug users.” They are professionals with careers, families, and responsibilities who were drawn to 7OH due to the perception that it was legal, safer, or easier to manage than prescription opioids. As bans take effect, most prescriptions are being filled with generic buprenorphine/naloxone films, primarily from manufacturers like Dr. Reddy’s and Viatris (formerly Mylan). From a systems perspective, this transition appears less like harm reduction and more like a rapid shift of dependence from an unregulated substance to long-term medication-assisted treatment. This creates a paradoxical situation: On one hand, this is a growing public health issue that requires regulation, informed consent, and long-term outcomes. On the other hand, it represents a structural shift that benefits a select few pharmaceutical manufacturers who are positioned to capitalize on the demand generated by these bans. While I oppose the idea of profiting from addiction or regulatory failure, overlooking the economic incentives embedded in this transition seems naive. If a legally sold substance leads a significant population into lifelong treatment, it has far-reaching implications for patients, providers, policy, healthcare costs, and markets. I’m curious to understand others perspectives on this matter: Are we effectively addressing the problem, or are we merely shifting it into a more institutionalized and profitable form?",

      "selftext_processed": "Across the U.S. Suboxone prescriptions are rapidly increasing as states implement restrictions or outright bans on 7hydroxymitragynine 7OH . As access to 7OH becomes more limited many users are swiftly transitioned to generic Suboxone as part of their treatment plan . If you delve into the Quitting 7OH thread you ’ ll notice a significant number of users describing their placement on Suboxone . For many stopping 7OH serves as a temporary bridge to Suboxone while for others it becomes a longterm solution . This situation raises a serious public health concern . Withdrawal from 7OH is often described as more severe and destabilizing compared to withdrawal from traditional prescription opioids including extreme sensory disturbances . This severity is particularly concerning given that 7OH has been widely accessible through gas stations and smokevape shops with minimal regulation . Another overlooked aspect is the diverse group of individuals affected . Many users are not_stereotypical “ drug users. ” They are professionals with careers families and responsibilities who were drawn to 7OH due to the perception that it was legal safer or easier to manage than prescription opioids . As bans take effect most prescriptions are being filled with generic buprenorphinenaloxone films primarily from manufacturers like Dr. Reddy ’ s and Viatris formerly Mylan . From a systems perspective this transition appears less like harm reduction and more like a rapid shift of dependence from an unregulated substance to longterm medicationassisted treatment . This creates a paradoxical situation On one hand this is a growing public health issue that requires regulation informed consent and longterm outcomes . On the other hand it represents a structural shift that benefits a select few pharmaceutical manufacturers who are positioned to capitalize on the demand generated by these bans . While I oppose the idea of profiting from addiction or regulatory failure overlooking the economic incentives embedded in this transition seems naive . If a legally sold substance leads a significant population into lifelong treatment it has farreaching implications for patients providers policy healthcare costs and markets . I ’ m curious to understand others perspectives on this matter Are we effectively addressing the problem or are we merely shifting it into a more institutionalized and profitable form"

Turns out there's decent academic research on this. High roic combined with low reinvestment needs tends to compound wealth over time. Makes sense because youre buying businesses that generate excess returns and dont need to plow everything back in just to maintain competitive position. Debt coverage matters more than absolute debt levels. A company with moderate debt but strong interest coverage is safer than a company with low debt but weak cash generation. Gross margin stability over 5 to 10 years is a better moat indicator than any single year snapshot. If margins are consistent through different economic cycles, theres probably something protecting the business. Payout ratios below 60% for dividend stocks. Once you get above that youre betting on earnings growth just to maintain the dividend which adds risk. Free cash flow yield matters more than earnings yield because earnings can be manipulated way easier than actual cash coming in. None of this is revolutionary but combining these filters actually produces a pretty different list than just sorting by pe. Way fewer names but higher quality.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking about this a lot and wanted to hear other people’s perspectives, especially from those living or working in Western countries. It feels like many big companies today are no longer built around delivering genuinely good products or services to customers. Instead, the focus seems to be on maximizing short term returns for investors and shareholders, even if that hurts product quality or customer experience. We see this in things like price increases, worse customer service, more subscriptions, and constant cost cutting, while CEOs and executives seem more focused on stock prices and quarterly numbers than on whether customers are actually happy. Once a sale is made, it often feels like the customer becomes secondary. I get that profits and investors matter, but customers are the ones who create that money. Without trust and long term loyalty, how sustainable is this model really? Has capitalism shifted to an investor first system, or am I just seeing the worst examples? Curious to hear what others think, especially from people who work in business or corporate environments.",

It feels like many big companies today are no_longer built around delivering genuinely good products or services to customers . Instead the focus seems to be on maximizing short term returns for investors and shareholders even if that hurts product quality or customer experience . We see this in things like price increases worse customer service more subscriptions and constant cost cutting while CEOs and executives seem more focused on stock prices and quarterly numbers than on whether customers are actually happy . Once a sale is made it often feels like the customer becomes secondary . I get that profits and investors matter but customers are the ones who create that money . Without trust and long term loyalty how sustainable is this model really Has capitalism shifted to an investor first system or am I just seeing the worst examples Curious to hear what others think especially from people who work in business or corporate environments ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been looking at Uber ($UBER) over the past few days. Stock seems to be under the radar of a lot of investors. Does anyone here have strong conviction either way on UBER (up or down)? Autonomous driving and robotaxis could be a threat but also could be a massive opportunity. Labor is one of the biggest costs for UBER…and if you eliminate the drivers it would be massively accretive. They have a partnership with Waymo, which in my mind is further ahead with autonomous driving tech than is TSLA. Investors are willing to give a massive valuation bump to TSLA for robotaxis but nothing for UBER. Seems like a disconnect to me. Robotaxis could be an existential threat to UBER. But I don’t see it. In the meantime, they are still growing revenues at 20% or greater, generating a lot of cash and shrinking the share count. Thoughts either bullish or bearish??",

NVTS makes GaN and SiC power chips that are more efficient, and it’s already lined up with NVIDIA’s next-gen AI power setup, so there’s a real chance it benefits as data centres upgrade. The downside is the big money from this probably doesn’t show up until around 2027, with 2026 being more of a build-up year. Still, people are buying now because if it all plays out, the long-term upside could be huge. I am lumping on and holding while the price is good.",

The downside is the big money from this probably doesn ’ t show up until around 2027 with 2026 being more of a buildup year . Still people are buying now because if it all plays out the longterm upside could be huge . I am lumping on and holding while the price is good ."

Over the holidays a close family member passed away and just this week, I found out they left me a huge surprise... $500,000 in a Schwab account and $50k cash. I have no idea what stocks/bonds/etfs/etc. it is invested in yet, nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall. My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash , but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road. Some information on our current financial situation: We own our home valued at $360k still owing $278k with a 2.75% interest rate. I have $26k in a personal brokerage account. $3k in a Roth IRA, $25k in my company 401k and make an annual pre-tax wage of about $90k - $100k with salary and overtime. The Wife makes around $90k annually as well, with only $3k in a Roth IRA. No other investments. We've only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs. We have a vehicle loan with $9k left on it, and a solar loan with about $10k left on it. No other debt (besides the previously mentioned mortgage). As I stated, I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation. Any insight is welcome.",

I have no_idea what stocksbondsetfsetc . it is invested in yet nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall . My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road . Some information on our current financial situation We own our home valued at $ 360k still owing $ 278k with a 2.75 % interest rate . I have $ 26k in a personal brokerage account . $ 3k in a Roth IRA $ 25k in my company 401k and make an annual pretax wage of about $ 90k $ 100k with salary and overtime . The Wife makes around $ 90k annually as well with only $ 3k in a Roth IRA . No_other investments . Weve only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs . We have a vehicle loan with $ 9k left on it and a solar loan with about $ 10k left on it . No_other debt besides the previously mentioned mortgage . As I stated I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation . Any insight is welcome ."

      "selftext": "A few days ago, I was watching a YouTube video with car content, and they said that sales of luxury cars have declined, which is true, but Ferrari is not included in that. Lamborghini belongs to the VW Group (along with Audi). They are awesome cars, but the brand appeals more to \"New Money\" (Crypto, YouTubers, Influencers). It is more vulnerable to trends.The biggest mistake investors make is comparing Ferrari to car manufacturers. Founder, Enzo Ferrari said, \"Always build one car less than the market demands.\" It doesn't sell transportation. It sells access to an exclusive club. Ferrari has exceptional finances and locked-in revenue for the next two years as it operates on a pre-order basis. Due to inflation, materials have become more expensive. Ferrari raised its prices by 10-15%. Did anyone cancel their order? No. Its customers do not look at the price. This protects its profits from inflation. The average Ferrari customer has many cars in their garage. They do not buy a Ferrari to go to work. They buy it as a collector's item. In a crisis, you are not affected because we are not talking about people who are financially insecure, but about millionaires. The respect that the company itself shows for its product is very important, with its customer base, blacklist, and strict penalties in case of resale or conversion of the car, giving even more the impression that this is not a car company but a company with works of art. I believe that the decline in share price is occurring for similar reasons as with Google and Uber at the moment. There is a lot of pessimism and speculation (Ferrari is preparing to launch its first all-electric (EV) car in late 2025/early 2026), which will be forgotten over time as it is not very well-founded. This is an exceptional company that has proven many times that every decline acts as a bounce-back spring and acts as a counterweight in bear markets. **I would be happy to hear opposing views in case I am missing something.**",

      "selftext_processed": "A few days ago I was watching a YouTube video with car content and they said that sales of luxury cars have declined which is true but Ferrari is not_included in that . Lamborghini belongs to the VW Group along with Audi . They are awesome cars but the brand appeals more to New Money Crypto YouTubers Influencers . It is more vulnerable to trends.The biggest mistake investors make is comparing Ferrari to car manufacturers . Founder Enzo Ferrari said Always build one car less than the market demands . It doesnt sell transportation . It sells access to an exclusive club . Ferrari has exceptional finances and lockedin revenue for the next two years as it operates on a preorder basis . Due to inflation materials have become more expensive . Ferrari raised its prices by 1015 % . Did anyone cancel their order No_Its customers do not_look at the price . This protects its profits from inflation . The average Ferrari customer has many cars in their garage . They do not_buy a Ferrari to go to work . They buy it as a collectors item . In a crisis you are not_affected because we are not_talking about people who are financially insecure but about millionaires . The respect that the company itself shows for its product is very important with its customer base blacklist and strict penalties in case of resale or conversion of the car giving even more the impression that this is not_a car company but a company with works of art . I believe that the decline in share price is occurring for similar reasons as with Google and Uber at the moment . There is a lot of pessimism and speculation Ferrari is preparing to launch its first allelectric EV car in late 2025early 2026 which will be forgotten over time as it is not_very wellfounded . This is an exceptional company that has proven many times that every decline acts as a bounceback spring and acts as a counterweight in bear markets . I would be happy to hear opposing views in case I am missing something ."

      "title": "Struggling With DCA Timing How Do You Deploy Capital?",
      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been in the market since 2020 and I’m looking for advice on dollar cost averaging (DCA). If you had 40k to invest across 5-6 stocks, how would you approach DCA? Over what time period would you deploy the capital? Does the DCA timeline depend on the stock, or do you follow a fixed schedule? Do you keep cash on the side, and if so, how much? Or are you 100% invested? Some of these stocks are already down ~20% over the past 5–6 months, which makes timing even harder. My biggest problem is thinking I’m buying the bottom when I’m not. I know timing the bottom is nearly impossible, but even using charts, I still deploy capital too early and end up with no cash left while the stock continues to fall. Are there any practical rules or frameworks you use to manage this especially to avoid deploying capital too fast? Appreciate any insights.",

      "selftext": "Letter from Fidelity the other day mentioned the followings: \"Effective November 10, 2025, the “Principal Investment Strategies” and “Principal Investment Risks” sections of the prospectus of each index fund shown in the table below was modified to indicate that the fund ***may operate as a non-diversified fund***, as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940, ***to the approximate extent the index is non-diversified***. A non-diversified fund may invest a greater portion of its assets in securities of a smaller number of individual issuers than a diversified fund. As a result, changes in the market value of a single investment could cause greater fluctuations in share price than would occur in a more diversified fund. Shareholder approval will not be sought when a fund crosses from diversified to nondiversified status due to changes in the relative market capitalization or index weighting of one or more index constituents. | Fund | Index | |:---|:---| | Fidelity 500 Index Fund | S&P 500 Index | | Fidelity SAI U.S. Large Cap Index Fund | S&P 500 Index | | VIP Index 500 Portfolio | S&P 500 Index | | Fidelity Total Market Index Fund | Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index | | Series Total Market Index Fund | Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index | \"",

At worst, it could spark an armed conflict between NATO members, something the global financial system is absolutely not built to handle. Markets hate uncertainty, and this would be uncertainty on a historic scale. Trade between the U.S. and Europe would likely be disrupted or frozen, shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Arctic would be militarized, and global supply chains would seize up almost overnight. Energy prices would spike, markets would panic, and investor confidence would evaporate. The U.S. economy is especially vulnerable here because it’s heavily dependent on globalized, high tech supply chains. Semiconductors, rare earth processing, advanced manufacturing none of these exist in isolation. If relations with Europe and allied nations collapse, access to critical components and materials would be severely constrained. A tech-driven economy can’t function if it can’t get chips, equipment, or precision manufacturing machinery. Beyond the immediate economic damage, the long-term consequences would be even worse: capital flight from U.S. markets, a weakened dollar, and a permanent loss of trust in America as a stable anchor of the global system. A move like this won't just be a geopolitical mistake; it would be economic turmoil on a scale we haven't seen in a long time.",

      "selftext": "U.S. stock futures moved lower as traders reacted to Wall Street’s first consecutive losses in 2026. Futures tied to the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all slipped, signaling a cautious open after recent selling pressure ended the market’s early-year momentum. The pullback reflects a mix of profit taking, sector rotation, and uncertainty around macro conditions, with tech stocks facing the most pressure in recent sessions. After a strong start to the year, some traders appear to be reassessing risk and waiting for clearer signals from earnings and economic data. For now, the softer futures suggest markets may stay range bound in the short term, as investors balance longer term optimism with near term caution. Whether this turns into a deeper correction or just a pause will likely depend on upcoming data and broader market sentiment.",

There is revenue growth but there’s only so many ads and so many people you can show ads to. Metaverse failed and they wasted $73B. Cool. Raybans are a bright spot but haven’t moved revenue all THAT much. Apple and Google plan on releasing their own glasses soon. Yes, I know there is a market for all 3 to exit but METAs Rayban revenue not exploding when they are essentially the only players in the market rn is not good. AI. Ok so They are spending billions on compute but what are they going to do with it? Google and Tesla are using compute for self driving cars and Gemini which will power Siri. I see robotaxis adding to revenue eventually although Waymo is not profitable yet. NVDA is Using AI for drug discovery and autonomous vehicles. But what is META doing with it? How is all of this AI spend going to increase and diversify revenue. Are we just going to see AI ads everywhere and AI content on IG and FB? My biggest gripe with META is the fact that people can easily just become bored with their platforms. Who’s to say in 10 years Instagram and FB aren’t cool anymore? Humans are always flocking to the next best thing. We’ve seen how Snapchat died. It seems as though they keep throwing money at any and everything just to see what works and that is not good What am I missing?",

There is revenue growth but there ’ s only so many ads and so many people you can show ads to . Metaverse failed and they wasted $ 73B . Cool . Raybans are a bright spot but haven ’ t moved revenue all THAT much . Apple and Google plan on releasing their own glasses soon . Yes I know there is a market for all 3 to exit but METAs Rayban revenue not_exploding when they are essentially the only players in the market rn is not_good . AI . Ok so They are spending billions on compute but what are they going to do with it Google and Tesla are using compute for self driving cars and Gemini which will power Siri . I see robotaxis adding to revenue eventually although Waymo is not_profitable yet . NVDA is Using AI for drug discovery and autonomous vehicles . But what is META doing with it How is all of this AI spend going to increase and diversify revenue . Are we just going to see AI ads everywhere and AI content on IG and FB My biggest gripe with META is the fact that people can easily just become bored with their platforms . Who ’ s to say in 10 years Instagram and FB aren ’ t cool anymore Humans are always flocking to the next best thing . We ’ ve seen how Snapchat died . It seems as though they keep throwing money at any and everything just to see what works and that is not_good What am I missing"

Sure - a chicken farmer is in heaven in this scenario. But the top bought out all of the farms and since 99% of folk live in cities whos left to keep markets honest? Same for silver. By the time someone middle class sets up an egg farming operation in their country vacation property the price has already receded. > Do you know anyone irl who is mining silver or hoarding large amounts? If the common man has no silver to cash out, then theres nothing to keep the price honest, and guess who owns the mining companies? > your percieved value of something is meaningless. You could say google is a 100 trillion dollar company and be right if you have all the wealth - becouse thats the magic of wash trading. Whos left to sell shares of google? Real shares, not borrowed ones. > meanwhile, the influence drips up too. Not just money. If google is worth 5 trillion, only a few people know why, and at any moment could reverse the scheme and wipe out half its value. Thats some serious leverage over the executive suite off the books. > but be thankful. Becouse some day, maybe years from now, the masses will finally catch on. And when they do, the market will crash. Your retirement account only rises now becouse people buy puts and short stocks. But some day when all the bears are gone, theyll come feasting for the buy and hold crew. > for now, your longs help fund wash up. And so you feel like a smart person becouse all you did was set money aside with no effort. Some day that free lunch will stop being free.",

Commoditys is where smart people have had a safe haven against the rigged ass market for quite some time . After all no_ones big enough to influence the price of something so common as silver worldwide becouse someone with silver will just cash out . But thats where they went wrong Theres so much wealth at the top we are nearing an era where even the price of something so common as a chicken egg can be manipulated to 100x its current price and substained for a long time . Sure a chicken farmer is in heaven in this scenario . But the top bought out all of the farms and since 99 % of folk live in cities whos left to keep markets honest Same for silver . By the time someone middle class sets up an egg farming operation in their country vacation property the price has already receded . Do you know anyone irl who is mining silver or hoarding large amounts If the common man has no_silver to cash out then theres nothing_to keep the price honest and guess who owns the mining companies your percieved value of something is meaningless . You could say google is a 100 trillion dollar company and be right if you have all the wealth becouse thats the magic of wash trading . Whos left to sell shares of google Real shares not_borrowed ones . meanwhile the influence drips up too . Not_just money . If google is worth 5 trillion only a few people know why and at any moment could reverse the scheme and wipe out half its value . Thats some serious leverage over the executive suite off the books . but be thankful . Becouse some day maybe years from now the masses will finally catch on . And when they do the market will crash . Your retirement account only rises now becouse people buy puts and short stocks . But some day when all the bears are gone theyll come feasting for the buy and hold crew . for now your longs help fund wash up . And so you feel like a smart person becouse all you did was set money aside with no_effort . Some day that free lunch will stop being free ."

I am providing a link in the comments to their Q3 earnings report and 2 prior RBRK threads from this sub in the past. *Key Q3 earnings takeaways-* Subscription ARR grew 34% yoy to $1.35B. 3rd quarter revenue grew 48% yoy to $350M. 2,638 customers with $100k or more in subscription ARR; 27% increase yoy. Upon announcing Q3 earnings the share price spiked 25% to 92.77 and has since slowly gave back all those gains. Share price closed at $68.14 at the end of today’s trading session.

The job offers benefits but I’m not too knowledgable on them. I also have a 10K from grad party. What are things I should be taught before I start working even longer from now? 30$ an hour is decent money at 19. For more info I live with a friend who covers everything. That’s why I have no bills or debt. It’s why I even have the job. Now how do I invest to become rich or just well off?",

At what point a correction and a \"fasten your seatbelts\" scenario actually becomes a general disaster that will ruin a lot of people and take years to recover? For example, all the signs in April would point to a major downturn in the following months. Seeing it now, in the end it was just a small bump on the road. Even in the pandemic, everyone was somewhat able to foreshadow the shit hitting the fan (the S&P 500 began to fall down in mid-late february 2020, and we all were seeing huge news everywhere since december 2019). Anyone with a minor glance of the news could see what was likely to come in the following months. Now in 2026, everyone is talking of AI bubble, another global recession in the likes of 2008, an apocalyptical disaster scenario where everything starting falling from the sky.

      "selftext": "Listen up you beautiful financially illiterate degenerates, put down the SPY 0DTE lotto tickets for 30 seconds and use your 2 remaining brain cells. MDA Space (MDA.TO) (MDALF) for OTC is an actual space company, not another fake AI “cloud-enabled synergies” scam. These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they’re a full-on “international space mission partner” doing satellite systems, space robotics, and geo-intelligence. Translation: they make the robot arms that grab space junk, build the metal sky-wafers that beam your doomscrolling, and sell government-grade spy-pictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit. They build and operate satellite constellations for communications, Earth and space observation, and exploration infrastructure. Their customers are governments and big-boy contractors, not Dave from Robinhood on margin. THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “MDA Ltd.” to “MDA Space” in 2024, which is marketing-speak for “please give us a space stonk multiple.” As of mid-January 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD, after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists. You’re telling me clapped-up EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations, but an actual space hardware and geo-intel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a low-effort meme post? Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon’s space money, so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself. And while you smoothbrains are dumpster-diving weekly options, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “move quickly, embrace risks, be bold” with new tech and space systems. If the guy running the world’s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware, maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites, robotics, and geo-intel isn’t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $200 CAD",

MDA Space MDA.TO MDALF for OTC is an actual space company not_another fake AI “ cloudenabled synergies ” scam . These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they ’ re a fullon “ international space mission partner ” doing satellite systems space robotics and geointelligence . Translation they make the robot arms that grab space junk build the metal skywafers that beam your doomscrolling and sell governmentgrade spypictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit . They build and operate satellite constellations for communications Earth and space observation and exploration infrastructure . Their customers are governments and bigboy contractors not_Dave from Robinhood on margin . THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “ MDA Ltd. ” to “ MDA Space ” in 2024 which is marketingspeak for “ please give us a space stonk multiple. ” As of midJanuary 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists . You ’ re telling me clappedup EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations but an actual space hardware and geointel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a loweffort meme post Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon ’ s space money so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself . And while you smoothbrains are dumpsterdiving weekly options Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “ move quickly embrace risks be bold ” with new tech and space systems . If the guy running the world ’ s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites robotics and geointel isn ’ t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $ 200 CAD"

      "selftext": "Hello, looking for some opinions here. I live in **Lebanon (not US)**. I make about **$2,600/month net**, work full time as a software engineer, and still live with my parents so my expenses aren’t that high. No other income. Right now I’ve got roughly **$24k total**: * about **$18k in gold** (4 oz) * **$1.5k stocks** * **$2.2k crypto** * **$2.5k cash** I’m considering buying an apartment for **$115k**. It’s **83 sqm, 2 bedrooms**, building is around **25 years old**, quiet area close to where I live. Rent would probably be: * **~$500/month unfurnished** * **~$600/month furnished**, but I’d need to buy furniture first To do this I’d basically have to liquidate most of what I own, put **$25k down**, and take a **$90k loan at 6% interest**. That’s pretty much the only housing loan option here. My idea was to try and **pay it off fast** (maybe ~7 years if I really push it), keep it rented, and then maybe use it later to buy another place. What I’m struggling with: * Is this actually a decent move or am I forcing my first real estate deal? * Selling gold for this feels risky… but also holding it forever feels like doing nothing * Am I missing something obvious (maintenance, vacancies, bad math, etc.)? If you were in my situation, would you do this or just stay liquid and wait? Appreciate any thoughts.",

I make about $ 2600month net work full time as a software engineer and still live with my parents so my expenses aren ’ t that high . No_other income . Right now I ’ ve got roughly $ 24k total about $ 18k in gold 4 oz $ 1.5k stocks $ 2.2k crypto $ 2.5k cash I ’ m considering buying an apartment for $ 115k . It ’ s 83 sqm 2 bedrooms building is around 25 years old quiet area close to where I live . Rent would probably be $ 500month unfurnished $ 600month furnished but I ’ d need to buy furniture first To do this I ’ d basically have to liquidate most of what I own put $ 25k down and take a $ 90k loan at 6 % interest . That ’ s pretty much the only housing loan option here . My idea was to try and pay it off fast maybe 7 years if I really push it keep it rented and then maybe use it later to buy another place . What I ’ m struggling with Is this actually a decent move or am I forcing my first real estate deal Selling gold for this feels risky… but also holding it forever feels like doing nothing_ Am I missing something obvious maintenance vacancies bad math etc . If you were in my situation would you do this or just stay liquid and wait Appreciate any thoughts ."

      "selftext": "# MonthPulse Tactical: Neutral/Volatile Setups for Jan 2026 [NA Market] **Date:** January 14, 2026 **Strategy:** Long-Only Tactical Momentum **Focus:** NYSE, NASDAQ, TSX Markets are chopping as geopolitical headlines (Iran) and mixed bank earnings weigh on the indices. However, **chaos creates ladders**. We are seeing a historic decoupling where Commodities (Gold/Silver/Uranium) and Crypto are ripping while Big Tech takes a breather. This is a stock picker's environment. Here are the top high-conviction setups for the next 30 days: | Ticker | Price | Target | Gain % | Risk | Note | | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | | **COIN** | $255.47 | $350.00 | +37% | High | BTC at $95k is the fuel. | | **CCO.TO** | C$152.17 | C$185.00 | +21% | Med | Nuclear super-cycle breakout. | | **PAAS** | $55.86 | $75.00 | +34% | High | Silver at $92/oz = Money Printer. | | **NVDA** | $182.14 | $250.00 | +37% | Med | Best dip-buy in Tech. | ### 🚨 The Thesis * **COIN (Coinbase):** Bitcoin is proving to be the safe haven of 2026. With BTC holding $95k, COIN's transaction volumes are set to explode. It's high beta, but the trend is undeniable. * **CCO.TO (Cameco):** Energy security is back on the menu. With oil volatile and nuclear adoption growing, Cameco is the premier way to play the uranium squeeze on the TSX. * **PAAS (Pan American Silver):** Silver is absolutely parabolic right now (~$92/oz). Miners lag the spot price, which means PAAS has significant catch-up potential. * **NVDA (Nvidia):** The king is resting. Down from highs, NVDA at $182 offers a tactical entry before the next leg of AI capex announcements. --- *Disclaimer: Not financial advice. I am a portfolio manager, not your fiduciary.

      "selftext": "Background: M28, good income, high risk tolerance. Current portfolio: 50% in stocks, 20% in SPYM, 20% in target date 401k, 10% in cash. I'm relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research. In March 2025, my portfolio was down 30% and it really didn't bother me one bit. The only issue I had was that since I was already 100% invested, I didn't have cash to buy more at the discounted prices :( Next time when something like this happens, I want to be able to make the best use of it. 1. Should I keep some money in gold, silver or bonds? If yes, how much? I don't care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term. 3. I read a research paper suggesting 100% equities for long horizon, but then I will have the same problem as last year. Maybe I can go 100% equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index. When the downturn comes, sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts. 3. I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity. Thoughts? I'd appreciate any suggestions. It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers, blogposts, etc. Thank you very much!!",

Im relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research . In March 2025 my portfolio was down 30 % and it really didnt bother me one bit . The only issue I had was that since I was already 100 % invested I didnt have cash to buy more at the discounted prices Next time when something like this happens I want to be able to make the best use of it . 1 . Should I keep some money in gold silver or bonds If yes how much I dont care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term . 3 . I read a research paper suggesting 100 % equities for long horizon but then I will have the same problem as last year . Maybe I can go 100 % equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index . When the downturn comes sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts . 3 . I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity . Thoughts Id appreciate any suggestions . It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers blogposts etc . Thank you very much"

Clearly the world markets are reacting to the instability being caused by the US. The USA is going in a very different direction than it has for the decades of American stock market over performance. Personally I think it's incredibly risky to not have a significant international portion of anyone's portfolio at this point.

Clearly the world markets are reacting to the instability being caused by the US . The USA is going in a very different direction than it has for the decades of American stock market over performance . Personally I think its incredibly risky to not_have a significant international portion of anyones portfolio at this point . I have rebalanced to 6040 InternationalUS in my equities given what Im seeing happening in my country as an American ."

A Short summary by ai of my thoughts: While AI is changing how we work, established giants like SAP, Salesforce, and DocuSign remain indispensable because they provide the reliability, features and trust that you can not get from self build and self sustained Software. Key Arguments: \\- All These complex System have started as simpler systems, the „unecessary“ are there for a reason Most of a time and as soon as Self Development solutions get more Mature they will get too complex to self sustain. That‘s the Point companies will have to Switch back to the big realiable systems. \\- Mission-Critical Stability: Traditional enterprise systems offer much higher \"up-time\" guarantees than self coded Software that unexperienced vibe coders developed. In business, a 0.1% difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster. \\- Built-in Standards: These platforms are already the \"plumbing\" of the business world. They integrate seamlessly into complex industries (like finance and healthcare) where security and regulations are non-negotiable. \\- Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it‘s essential that people can start with Software they already know. Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit, in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with. \\- AI as an Upgrade, Not a Replacement: Instead of being replaced by AI, these companies are absorbing it. By adding AI features (to their already trusted foundations, they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data. Docusign for example is not where it is because it‘s a signature Solution, but it’s a **trustworthy** signature Solution with a „history“. **You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks, but you won‘t build the trust!** The Bottom Line: You can't run a global business on \"smart\" self developed tools alone; you need tools that are proven to do their job, scale and guaranteed not to fail. **Is there something I don‘t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again?** edit: tried to improve the ai slop (critic was justified)",

In business a 0.1 % difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster . Builtin Standards These platforms are already the plumbing of the business world . They integrate seamlessly into complex industries like finance and healthcare where security and regulations are nonnegotiable . Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it ‘ s essential that people can start with Software they already know . Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with . AI as an Upgrade Not_a Replacement Instead of being replaced by AI these companies are absorbing it . By adding AI features to their already trusted foundations they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data . Docusign for example is not_where it is because it ‘ s a signature Solution but it ’ s a trustworthy signature Solution with a „ history “ . You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks but you won ‘ t build the trust The Bottom Line You cant run a global business on smart self developed tools alone you need tools that are proven to do their job scale and guaranteed not_to fail . Is there something I don ‘ t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again edit tried to improve the ai slop critic was justified"

      "title": "How do one predict, the next metal market crash? (SILVER)",
      "selftext": "I’ve been focusing heavily on silver, and these are the metrics I’m watching to understand where this market might be headed. Posting this here to get feedback and checks. 1.The first thing I track is the silver:gold. If silver starts outperforming gold aggressively and the ratio drops rapidly below 50:1, it usually signals speculative momentum. 2.I’m also watching COMEX registered inventories very closely. If registered silver keeps falling, COMEX is more likely to increase margin requirements to reduce delivery risk. That can temporarily cap price. On the flip side, if there’s a sudden large inflow into COMEX vaults, it signals that a large bank or institution is preparing to sell or short silver, or that metal is being moved in to ease delivery pressure. 3.China is another key piece. China controls a large share of silver refining and industrial demand, and whenever Shanghai silver trades at a strong premium to international prices, it points to regional physical tightness. Any changes in Chinese industrial policy or metals regulation tend to show up in silver before the rest of the market reacts. And, with Asian physical premiums elevated, there’s a clear arbitrage incentive: buy paper silver cheaply in Western markets, take delivery, move it to Asia, and sell at a premium. This slowly drains Western vaults and increases structural stress in the futures market. 4.Also A strengthening US Dollar Index combined with signs of geopolitical stability increases the probability of a correction. A weakening dollar and rising uncertainty usually act as fuel. 5.I am also watching silver lease rates. If lease rates spike into the 5–10% range, it usually means there’s an acute physical shortage. Historically, this often leads to a sharp correction. 6.In the futures market, I pay close attention to price vs open interest. If price is rising while open interest is falling, the rally is likely being driven by short covering, not new long positions. If I’m missing any major indicators - fundamental, technical, or structural framework, I’d appreciate hearing them. Trying to understand the plumbing of this market before it breaks. Note: The current price of silver is about 92$ per ounce.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been focusing heavily on silver and these are the metrics I ’ m watching to understand where this market might be headed . Posting this here to get feedback and checks . 1.The first thing I track is the silvergold . If silver starts outperforming gold aggressively and the ratio drops rapidly below 501 it usually signals speculative momentum . 2.I ’ m also watching COMEX registered inventories very closely . If registered silver keeps falling COMEX is more likely to increase margin requirements to reduce delivery risk . That can temporarily cap price . On the flip side if there ’ s a sudden large inflow into COMEX vaults it signals that a large bank or institution is preparing to sell or short silver or that metal is being moved in to ease delivery pressure . 3.China is another key piece . China controls a large share of silver refining and industrial demand and whenever Shanghai silver trades at a strong premium to international prices it points to regional physical tightness . Any changes in Chinese industrial policy or metals regulation tend to show up in silver before the rest of the market reacts . And with Asian physical premiums elevated there ’ s a clear arbitrage incentive buy paper silver cheaply in Western markets take delivery move it to Asia and sell at a premium . This slowly drains Western vaults and increases structural stress in the futures market . 4.Also A strengthening US Dollar Index combined with signs of geopolitical stability increases the probability of a correction . A weakening dollar and rising uncertainty usually act as fuel . 5.I am also watching silver lease rates . If lease rates spike into the 5–10 % range it usually means there ’ s an acute physical shortage . Historically this often leads to a sharp correction . 6.In the futures market I pay close attention to price vs open interest . If price is rising while open interest is falling the rally is likely being driven by short covering not_new long positions . If I ’ m missing any major indicators fundamental technical or structural framework I ’ d appreciate hearing them . Trying to understand the plumbing of this market before it breaks . Note The current price of silver is about 92 $ per ounce ."

      "selftext": "**Current Price:** \\~GBX 123 / CAD 2.29 **Market Cap:** \\~£580m / CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer, beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year. You are buying a high-grade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks (JPM, Goldman) forecast gold to hit $4,000-$5,000/oz in 2026. The kicker? The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China, and Amaroq holds the keys to the region's copper and strategic minerals. **1. The Cash Flow Engine is Live** Most junior miners fail because they can't build the mine. Amaroq has crossed that bridge. * **Production Beat:** They just reported FY2025 production of \\~6,600 oz, beating the midpoint of their 6-7koz guidance. * **High Grade:** This is a narrow-vein deposit with historical grades of 18-28 g/t.High grade protects margins if prices dip. * **Phase 2 Catalyst:** The real re-rate happens in Q2 2026. They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to \\~90%.This is pure margin expansion. **2. The Macro Setup (Gold Supercycle)** The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices, but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 2026/2027: * **J.P. Morgan:** Forecasts $5,055/oz by Q4 2026. * **Bank of America:** Sees upside to $5,000/oz.If gold goes to $4,000+, Amaroq's free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely self-fund their massive exploration portfolio, eliminating the need for dilution. **3. The Geopolitical \"Put\" Option** This is the unique value driver. The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of China's control. * **Strategic Assets:** Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt (potential IOCG system) and Stendalen (Nickel/PGM). * **US Government Funding:** CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support. * **The Moat:** If the US wants Greenland's minerals, Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region. **Valuation & Asymmetry** The stock trades like a developer, but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer. You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copper/strategic minerals and the \"US National Security\" premium for free. **Key Risks** * **Nugget Effect:** The gold is coarse and erratic. Quarterly production will be volatile. You have to look at annual averages, not quarterly misses/beats. * **Execution:** They need to deliver Phase 2 on time (Q2 2026) to hit the 90% recovery targets. * **Logistics:** It's the Arctic. Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements.",

      "selftext_processed": "Current Price GBX 123 CAD 2.29 Market Cap £580m CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year . You are buying a highgrade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks JPM Goldman forecast gold to hit $ 4000 $ 5000oz in 2026 . The kicker The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China and Amaroq holds the keys to the regions copper and strategic minerals . 1 . The Cash Flow Engine is Live Most junior miners fail because they cant build the mine . Amaroq has crossed that bridge . Production Beat They just reported FY2025 production of 6600 oz beating the midpoint of their 67koz guidance . High Grade This is a narrowvein deposit with historical grades of 1828 gt.High grade protects margins if prices dip . Phase 2 Catalyst The real rerate happens in Q2 2026 . They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to 90 % .This is pure margin expansion . 2 . The Macro Setup Gold Supercycle The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 20262027 J.P. Morgan Forecasts $ 5055oz by Q4 2026 . Bank of America Sees upside to $ 5000oz.If gold goes to $ 4000 Amaroqs free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely selffund their massive exploration portfolio eliminating the need for dilution . 3 . The Geopolitical Put Option This is the unique value driver . The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of Chinas control . Strategic Assets Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt potential IOCG system and Stendalen NickelPGM . US Government Funding CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support . The Moat If the US wants Greenlands minerals Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region . Valuation Asymmetry The stock trades like a developer but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer . You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copperstrategic minerals and the US National Security premium for free . Key Risks Nugget Effect The gold is coarse and erratic . Quarterly production will be volatile . You have to look at annual averages not_quarterly missesbeats . Execution They need to deliver Phase 2 on time Q2 2026 to hit the 90 % recovery targets . Logistics Its the Arctic . Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements ."

      "selftext": "On January 14, spot silver surged past $92/oz, up nearly 6% on the day. New York silver also jumped about 6% to $91.57/oz. So far this year, silver is already up around 25%. The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data, along with ongoing physical supply shortages. I’ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time. Tin was up nearly 40% last year, and is already up more than 25% so far in 2026. Indonesia is the world’s second largest tin producer how do people view that market? Do you think this move is just a CPI-driven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven? Is this part of a bigger longer term trend?",

So far this year silver is already up around 25 % . The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data along with ongoing physical supply shortages . I ’ ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time . Tin was up nearly 40 % last year and is already up more than 25 % so far in 2026 . Indonesia is the world ’ s second largest tin producer how do people view that market Do you think this move is just a CPIdriven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven Is this part of a bigger longer term trend"

Before this though, I solely just invested in Robinhood but that was before I was financially more literate. I’m trying to rebalance my portfolio because I should have done this much sooner. I just want to hear some opinions on it. I’m taking each with a grain of salt or heavy research after. My approach Roth IRA = growth stocks (VTI, SPY, VOO) Robinhood = Income Focused (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI) The plan is to retire off of dividends but also have a good savings account. I’m currently 25 and my income is nothing fancy. My robinhood is roughly reaching 20k but that’s because so have a good mix of growth stocks and dividend stocks in it.",

You know what is out of fashion? Competence. You know what is in fashion? Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $35. And you know who is letting it happen? Alaska Airlines - they know *all about it* but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart. This isn't an airline. It is a distressed fintech with planes attached, run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus. **I am Short Alaska Airlines. Here is the dirt.** But if your smooth-brains don't want to read or think, just jam this [report]( into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic? It will tell you to short at the double. # 1. The \"Penalty Box\" Infinite Loop (Tech is F*cked) In 2022, some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury. It was a last-minute ticket, and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never knew until it was too late. ALK agreed to give his points back as a \"one-time courtesy,\" but then punished the **victim** by permanently banning them from booking online. They have to call a phone line (open 9-5) to use their own points forever. Fast forward 4 years to 2026. They haven't fixed a single line of code. It is the exact same robbery. Exact same response. Only now, hackers are running a train on Alaska. Look at the scoreboard: 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025. \"370? Who cares?\" you ask, wiping Cheeto dust on your wife's boyfriend's couch. Listen to me. More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of mile-sniffers. 41 came from a niche Chinese-language chat room (US Card Forum) with only 12,000 weekly visitors. That is the tip of the iceberg. If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit, the real number across the 12 million normies who don't check their accounts daily is in the **tens of thousands**. An airline with tech so jacked they can't even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no place in the modern world. # 2. The \"This is America\" Factor Now, I'm not a complete moron. I know how this works. Leaking 100,000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats? Ha, this is America. Nobody will care about that. Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up. But this is more than that. # 3. The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse. The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too. ALK Market Cap: $5.5B. ALK Loyalty Scheme Value: $12B (2024 investor day said so). Bungle the loyalty scheme, the easiest free money printer you can dream of, and everything goes with it. Watch how they show the world they have no control of it. The Q2 2025 Surprise: ALK suddenly booked a $180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere. No revenue match. Just $180M dropped from the sky. The Receivables Game: In the same quarter, their receivables from Bank of America (their credit card daddy) spiked $195M. Translation: Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no reason. If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand. No explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle: By Q3, $120M of that receivable vanished from \"Current Assets\" and wormed its way into \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC won't check the storage locker. Spoiler: They will. # 4. The Unapprehended Traveler (The Kill Shot) This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs. And make the stock rock soon. Right now - literally today - there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskan's hard-earned miles. So hard-earned that our hero victim actually spotted it! He called up Alaska! *\"Hey! There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now!\"* The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk, right? Wait until CBP takes him out back... **NOPE.** It doesn't happen. The thief isn't brave; he's safe. **Because Alaska never tells anyone.** There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster *who was literally in the air*, and Alaska refused. Why? Because an arrest creates a Police Report. A Police Report creates a Public Record. A Public Record proves a Data Breach. A Breach crashes the Stock. They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up. How you think the Trumpisters gonna play this when they find out... # The Play The assets are unexplained ($180M apparition). The tech is broken (no 2FA). The governance is cowardly (hiding the breach).

You know what is out of fashion Competence . You know what is in fashion Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $ 35 . And you know who is letting it happen Alaska Airlines they know all about it but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart . This isnt an airline . It is a distressed fintech with planes attached run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus . I am Short Alaska Airlines . Here is the dirt . But if your smoothbrains dont want to read or think just jam this report into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic It will tell you to short at the double . 1 . The Penalty Box Infinite Loop Tech is Fcked In 2022 some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury . It was a lastminute ticket and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never_knew until it was too late . ALK agreed to give his points back as a onetime courtesy but then punished the victim by permanently banning them from booking online . They have to call a phone line open 95 to use their own points forever . Fast forward 4 years to 2026 . They havent fixed a single line of code . It is the exact same robbery . Exact same response . Only now hackers are running a train on Alaska . Look at the scoreboard 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025 . 370 Who cares you ask wiping Cheeto dust on your wifes boyfriends couch . Listen to me . More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of milesniffers . 41 came from a niche Chineselanguage chat room US Card Forum with only 12000 weekly visitors . That is the tip of the iceberg . If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit the real number across the 12 million normies who dont check their accounts daily is in the tens of thousands . An airline with tech so jacked they cant even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no_place in the modern world . 2 . The This is America Factor Now Im not_a complete moron . I know how this works . Leaking 100000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats Ha this is America . Nobody_will care about that . Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up . But this is more than that . 3 . The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse . The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too . ALK Market Cap $ 5.5B . ALK Loyalty Scheme Value $ 12B 2024 investor day said so . Bungle the loyalty scheme the easiest free money printer you can dream of and everything goes with it . Watch how they show the world they have no_control of it . The Q2 2025 Surprise ALK suddenly booked a $ 180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere_No revenue match . Just $ 180M dropped from the sky . The Receivables Game In the same quarter their receivables from Bank of America their credit card daddy spiked $ 195M . Translation Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no_reason . If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand . No_explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle By Q3 $ 120M of that receivable vanished from Current Assets and wormed its way into Other NonCurrent Assets . Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC wont check the storage locker . Spoiler They will . 4 . The Unapprehended Traveler The Kill Shot This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs . And make the stock rock soon . Right now literally today there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskans hardearned miles . So hardearned that our hero victim actually spotted it He called up Alaska Hey There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk right Wait until CBP takes him out back ... NOPE . It doesnt happen . The thief isnt brave hes safe . Because Alaska never_tells anyone . There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster who was literally in the air and Alaska refused . Why Because an arrest creates a Police Report . A Police Report creates a Public Record . A Public Record proves a Data Breach . A Breach crashes the Stock . They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up . How you think the Trumpisters gon na play this when they find out ... The Play The assets are unexplained $ 180M apparition . The tech is broken no 2FA . The governance is cowardly hiding the breach .

      "selftext": "Russell 2000 beat the S&P again yesterday (-0.1% vs -0.19%). That's 8 straight days of outperformance - hasn't happened since January 2019. A few things driving this: 1. Valuation gap is massive. S&P 600 small caps trade at ~15.6x forward earnings vs S&P 500 at ~22.6x. That's a 31% discount. 2. Rate cut expectations. Small caps got crushed by high rates (more debt-sensitive). Fed easing helps them disproportionately. 3. Rotation out of mega-caps. The \"Magnificent 7\" trade is getting crowded. Money is finally flowing downstream. For context, large caps have outperformed small caps for 5 straight years (2020-2025). The last time that happened was 1994-1998 - which was followed by 6 straight years of small cap outperformance (1999-2004). Not saying history repeats, but the setup is interesting. The catch: Small caps are riskier. Less liquidity, weaker balance sheets, more volatility. The Russell 2000 has ~40% of companies that aren't profitable. You can't just buy blindly. If you're looking at small caps, focus on profitability, debt levels, and revenue growth. The junk rallies first in a rotation, but quality wins over time.",

Valuation gap is massive . SP 600 small caps trade at 15.6x forward earnings vs SP 500 at 22.6x . Thats a 31 % discount . 2 . Rate cut expectations . Small caps got crushed by high rates more debtsensitive . Fed easing helps them disproportionately . 3 . Rotation out of megacaps . The Magnificent 7 trade is getting crowded . Money is finally flowing downstream . For context large caps have outperformed small caps for 5 straight years 20202025 . The last time that happened was 19941998 which was followed by 6 straight years of small cap outperformance 19992004 . Not_saying history repeats but the setup is interesting . The catch Small caps are riskier . Less liquidity weaker balance sheets more volatility . The Russell 2000 has 40 % of companies that arent profitable . You cant just buy blindly . If youre looking at small caps focus on profitability debt levels and revenue growth . The junk rallies first in a rotation but quality wins over time ."

      "selftext": "While tinkering around with finding good funds to invest in moving forward to slightly increase my international exposure, I came across what sounded like an agreement that FZROX was fine for pre tax accounts, but that it was ill-advised to use it for taxable accounts because it means that you can't leave fidelity without tax implications. I am invested entirely in FZROX and FZILX at the moment in my taxable accounts. 1. How concerning of a position is this? Should I make adjustments and find different no/low fee fund moving forward? I can do my own research but if the answer is yes, any fund recommendations I can use with Fidelity? 2. It's my understanding that the reason to avoid using it in taxable accounts is because it's locked into fidelity and can't be transferred, so switching brokerages requires liquidating it and realizing capital gains, then taxes. Is this the only reason why it's not recommended? 3. If the answer to 2 is yes, is it really that much of a risk to hold a fund that can't be transferred out of your brokerage without liquidating? I don't have plans to find another brokerage and it's unlikely Fidelity goes out of business. Or perhaps it's a situation where there's low upside and high downside if something very unlikely occurs? 4. I am planning to retire early. If it is the case that this was a big oopsie, I am assuming I'll begin investing in a new index fund, and simply prioritize withdrawals from the FZROX fund in the early days to decrease my allocation there over time. What else should I be thinking about if this was a large error? Cheers, and thanks for your help!",

Currently SK requires disclosures around topics including a companys securities ongoing material legal proceedings financial data cybersecurity risk management internal controls and corporate governance matters . From the Statement I welcome and encourage members of the public to provide their views on how the Commission can amend Regulation SK with the goal of revising the requirements to focus on eliciting disclosure of material information and avoid compelling the disclosure of immaterial information .

      "selftext": "Will there be an AI bubble peak? Yes. Every breakthrough technology has had over investment. Has AI bubble peaked? If you keep reading mainstream media, r/stocks, and listening to Michael Burry, you'd believe it. You'd be losing a lot of money though. **Real demand is through the roof:** * H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months. This is a clear indicator that Burry's claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong. Source mvcinvesting @ X. Can't post link here due to X being banned. * Burry’s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb. So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better. If companies all buy Nvidia’s new GPUs, Nvidia wins. If no one buys Nvidia’s new GPUs, then there is no faster than expected obsoletion. You can’t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs. Do people not see the glaring paradox? Burry’s short reason is completely illogical. The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall. We’re clearly not seeing this. * China's Alibaba Justin Lin just said they're severely constrained by inference demand. He said Tencent is the same. They simply do not have compute to meet user demand. They're having to use their precious compute for inference which does not leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans. Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason. Source: * Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand. Source: * You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI’s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it's not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they're already at $100b/year in revenue. Sources: Notice how compute is always followed by \"demand\". It's real demand. It's not a circular economy. It's truly real user demand. Listen to people actually are close to AI demand. They're all saying they're compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic's Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. **So why is demand increasing?** * Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it's ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support. * Models are getting smarter faster. It’s not slowing down. It’s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: Source 2: * There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs. * LLMs aren't just chat bots anymore. They're trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. * AI models are becoming so smart that they’re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here’s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: * There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating. Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended. Source: At some point, the AI bubble will peak. Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it. When it does pop, it's still going to be bigger than it was in 2025. The world will not use less AI or require less compute than 2025. We're going to have exponential increase in AI demand. If you’re still skittish about investing in AI stocks, then just invest in S&P500. All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost. Do not stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon. Stop listening to the mass media on AI. They’re always anti-tech. Always. They were anti-tech before AI boom. They will be after. Negative stories get views and engagement. AI could find a cure for a disease but they'll write about how AI hallucinated that one time. Follow the people who are actually working on AI. I’ll close with this: Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6% of GDP spend. AI is at 1% right now.",

      "selftext_processed": "Will there be an AI bubble peak Yes . Every breakthrough technology has had over investment . Has AI bubble peaked If you keep reading mainstream media rstocks and listening to Michael Burry youd believe it . Youd be losing a lot of money though . Real demand is through the roof H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months . This is a clear indicator that Burrys claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong . Source mvcinvesting X. Cant post link here due to X being banned . Burry ’ s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb . So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better . If companies all buy Nvidia ’ s new GPUs Nvidia wins . If no_one buys Nvidia ’ s new GPUs then there is no_faster than expected obsoletion . You can ’ t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs . Do people not_see the glaring paradox Burry ’ s short reason is completely illogical . The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall . We ’ re clearly not_seeing this . Chinas Alibaba Justin Lin just said theyre severely constrained by inference demand . He said Tencent is the same . They simply do not_have compute to meet user demand . Theyre having to use their precious compute for inference which does not_leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans . Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason . Source Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand . Source You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI ’ s reported revenue numbers . OpenAI is already at $ 20byear in revenue and without monetizing their free users . In 2024 their revenue grew by 2.5x . In 2025 their revenue grew by 4x . So its not_slowing down . If they grow 4x again in 2026 theyre already at $ 100byear in revenue . Sources Notice how compute is always followed by demand . Its real demand . Its not_a circular economy . Its truly real user demand . Listen to people actually are close to AI demand . Theyre all saying theyre compute constrained . Literally everyone does not_have enough compute . Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropics Claude models because Anthropic simply does not_have enough compute to meet demand . So why is demand increasing Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level . Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency . Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether its ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support . Models are getting smarter faster . It ’ s not_slowing down . It ’ s accelerating . In the last 6 months GPT5 Gemini 3 and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected . The intelligence graph is now exponential not_linear . Source 1 Source 2 There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again . GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100class chips . The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs . LLMs arent just chat bots anymore . Theyre trading stocks doing automated analysis writing apps from scratch solving previously unsolved math conjectures and is already showing signs of self improvement read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement . The token usage has exploded . If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails you are truly missing the forest for the trees . AI models are becoming so smart that they ’ re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems . Here ’ s Terence Tao one of the smartest humans alive explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating . Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended . Source At some point the AI bubble will peak . Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it . When it does pop its still going to be bigger than it was in 2025 . The world will not_use less AI or require less compute than 2025 . Were going to have exponential increase in AI demand . If you ’ re still skittish about investing in AI stocks then just invest in SP500 . All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost . Do not_stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon . Stop listening to the mass media on AI . They ’ re always antitech . Always . They were antitech before AI boom . They will be after . Negative stories get views and engagement . AI could find a cure for a disease but theyll write about how AI hallucinated that one time . Follow the people who are actually working on AI . I ’ ll close with this Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6 % of GDP spend . AI is at 1 % right now ."

      "selftext": "Czech defence firm Czechoslovak Group (CSG) on Wednesday announced its intention to float shares on Euronext Amsterdam in an initial public offering comprising both existing and new shares in what may be one of Europe's biggest IPOs this year. CSG said in a statement the offering was expected to take place in the coming weeks and would consist of new shares for 750 million euros ($873.60 million) and an amount of existing shares to be determined at a later stage. CSG, one of the world's fastest-growing defence firms which counts the Ukrainian military among its customers, said it will use proceeds from the sale of new shares for general corporate purposes. Sources have told Reuters the IPO could raise more than 3 billion euros ($3.50 billion), which would make CSG Amsterdam's largest IPO since InPost in 2021, which raised $3.9 billion, according to Dealogic data.

I say public because people who were closely following google probably saw this coming . Since Googles revenue primarily comes from ads LLMs eating up that market share questioned their future revenue potential . Then there was this whole saga of selling the Chrome browser . But they made a great comeback with the Gemini 3 and also TPUs being used for training it . Now the narrative is that Google is the best position company in the AI era .

      "selftext": "**USAR: 90% convinced, need a gut check before sizing up** Started a small position today at $16.58. Everything says this should be bigger. Talk me out of it. **What they do:** USA Rare Earth owns Round Top Mountain in Texas. Only major domestic deposit of heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium. These go into every F-35 (920 lbs per plane), EV motor, wind turbine, missile guidance system. China controls 99% of global heavy rare earth processing. **Why now:** * Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits * China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure * Stillwater, Oklahoma magnet facility starts production Q1 2026 * Acquired Less Common Metals for $100M in November - only scaled rare earth metal producer outside China **Numbers:** * $5.56 to $43.98 in 2025, now $16-17. Down 60% from highs * $2.5B market cap. MP Materials is $10B with $400M DoD backing * Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash * All Buy ratings, average target $23 **Bull case:** * MP got $400M government equity. USAR CEO says \"in close communication with administration\" * Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed * Stillwater revenue starts Q1 2026. First proof they can produce * China export restrictions return November 2026 **Bear case:** * Stillwater was supposed to produce in 2023, now 2026 * 211% dilution in 2025. More coming * MP already operational, profitable, government-backed * No confirmed government money yet **What I need:** Am I missing something on the bear case? Is dilution worse than I think? Wait for Stillwater confirmation? **Position:** 257 shares at $16.58. Considering 500-1000 more to hit 5-7% of portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Recently added position in UAMY. Dropping my DD. Thesis in short: UAMY is moving from being a raw material buyer to a vertically integrated domestic producer, a shift that management expects to triple profit margins from 20% to \\~60%. 2026 revenue guidance is recently raised to $125 million and the Thompson Falls smelter expansion coming online this month to increase output fivefold, the fundamental floor significantly higher than in previous years. Wall Street remains bullish, with a consensus \"Strong Buy\" rating and an average price target of $9.86 to $17, representing a \\~30% to 120% upside from current levels. Currently a 17.86% short interest is attempting to break the momentum of a massive institutional accumulation phase. Retention of price levels in the $7-8 range is likely to result in a gamma/short squeeze pushing the stock beyond $11. Stoch RSI is oversold, and relief rally to squeeze shorts should be imminent. Western Antimony supply is highly limited. UAMY is a strategic geopolitical stock pick, critical for defense, and is unlikely to see Antimony-specific China export ban repealed. US law will require defense to use non-Chinese sourced antimony - a big UAMY tailwind, as the only active smelter and refiner. 🍀🥸 $UAMY GL.",

Thesis in short UAMY is moving from being a raw material buyer to a vertically integrated domestic producer a shift that management expects to triple profit margins from 20 % to 60 % . 2026 revenue guidance is recently raised to $ 125 million and the Thompson Falls smelter expansion coming online this month to increase output fivefold the fundamental floor significantly higher than in previous years . Wall Street remains bullish with a consensus Strong Buy rating and an average price target of $ 9.86 to $ 17 representing a 30 % to 120 % upside from current levels . Currently a 17.86 % short interest is attempting to break the momentum of a massive institutional accumulation phase . Retention of price levels in the $ 78 range is likely to result in a gammashort squeeze pushing the stock beyond $ 11 . Stoch RSI is oversold and relief rally to squeeze shorts should be imminent . Western Antimony supply is highly limited . UAMY is a strategic geopolitical stock pick critical for defense and is unlikely to see Antimonyspecific China export ban repealed . US law will require defense to use nonChinese sourced antimony a big UAMY tailwind as the only active smelter and refiner . 🍀🥸 $ UAMY GL ."

      "selftext": "I bring this up due to the recent mentions of a drug patent cliff mentioned by CNBC, Globe and Mail, and Brownstone Research that will affect many of the big pharmaceutical companies. Is this as concerning for them as it's made out to be or is it just noise? There was a surge in biotech during covid, but that was because of covid. This one is more related to loss of profits. If it is as detrimental as it sounds then what companies do you guys think would benefit from this? Im not very familiar in what big pharma looks for when acquiring small cap biotech, but I've seen mentions of investments in oncology and weightloss drugs. Sellas is the name that's been hyped on this past month and I found it to be a coincidence that they're gearing up to be a solid buy out candidate at the same time the patent cliff is about to hit. I only mention sellas because they're one of the few biotechs that legitimately feels like they can execute based on the past trial data and current ongoing trial. I used them as a frame of reference, however, that's not the point. I want to know if there is a legitimate benefit for microcaps or small caps from the upcoming patent cliff. What're your picks if you do expect a cliff and just give a quick summary about the drug as well. Late-stage picks would make the most sense, early or mid stage isn't even in contention because of how unpredictable they are.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro, Interactive Brokers, Trading212, etc., with people reporting things like: - accounts being frozen or closed; - slow or unresponsive customer service; - difficulty withdrawing funds; - limited explanations during “reviews”. As a long-term retail investor, this honestly makes me uneasy. Many of us are investing years of savings, trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades. I’m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases, compliance issues, and I’d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors. Some genuine questions I have: What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account? How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked? Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice? - What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk? (multiple brokers, record-keeping, etc.) I’m not trying to bash any broker, just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages. Would love to hear: Personal experiences good or bad; Insights from people who’ve dealt with compliance reviews; Views from anyone with legal, regulatory, or professional investing background. Let’s keep it constructive, I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don’t always ask. Thanks in advance",

I have sold way too early on last week’s micron calls in which I could have also 4x’d.

      "selftext": "Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports. \"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\" The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts. The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use. \"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said. Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars. \"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. Tapped into USV industry. Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro. 1,800% YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long.",

      "selftext_processed": "Secretary of Defense Hegseth ’ s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no_brainer . The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies . It also assigns to combat units authority to buy test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes according to reports . While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape Hegseth said in the video online . Not anymore . The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by approving hundreds of American products for military purchase . It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry . The DOD plans to arm combat units with a variety of lowcost drones made by American engineers and AI experts . The order will also expand the Blue List of DODapproved unmanned drones components and software as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency according to reports . The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use . Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops the memo said . Lastly the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year which includes forceonforce drone wars . Lethality will not_be hindered by selfimposed restrictions especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue Hegseth wrote in the memo . The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones part of the SRR contract which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . Following news today RedCat ’ s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat ’ s drones . They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . There is also speculation that RedCat ’ s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its antijamming technology . They are also tapping in the USV which I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones . Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia Yup . RedCat . TLDR Drone warfare is here . American drone dominance is here . Plan to outpace China which means $ $ $ $ $ for drone industry . RedCat won SRR contract beating 30 competitors for it . Meeting the supply demand for the contract . Has connections to current administration . Approved for NATO . Tapped into USV industry . Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro . 1800 % YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long ."

      "selftext": "Everyone loves posting that chart and saying “just buy stocks and chill.” Cool story. It worked… in the past. \\[See image originally published in [ \\] But the world is quite different now - may more investors (educated or uneducated), many more interests, many more opportunities, different ways to get returns (think about e-Commerce, investing in fractional shares of Real Estate, etc). And, especially, I feel there are more companies getting listed now, and back then only the solid one would make it. Not that it prevented them from falling or failing, but at least there was more structure to that. So… I'm not implying that “**stocks are dead**” as I'm quite invested in that. Just wondering if we’re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature. * Are stocks **still** “the best” because they’re inherently superior, or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat? * Do future returns look anything like the past? * Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not repeat so similarly? * Where does Crypto sit in this equation? And especially: * What other asset, if not stocks, would you see as a winner - or at least as a close competitor to Stocks?",

See image originally published in But the world is quite different now may more investors educated or uneducated many more interests many more opportunities different ways to get returns think about eCommerce investing in fractional shares of Real Estate etc . And especially I feel there are more companies getting listed now and back then only the solid one would make it . Not_that it prevented them from falling or failing but at least there was more structure to that . So… Im not_implying that “ stocks are dead ” as Im quite invested in that . Just wondering if we ’ re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature . Are stocks still “ the best ” because they ’ re inherently superior or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat Do future returns look anything like the past Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not_repeat so similarly Where does Crypto sit in this equation And especially What other asset if not_stocks would you see as a winner or at least as a close competitor to Stocks"

One reason is that markets care more about policy than personalities. Investors are focused on interest rates, liquidity, and inflation trends, not headlines, unless those headlines threaten a shift in monetary policy. Another factor is institutional continuity. The Federal Reserve doesn’t hinge on one individual. Even if investigations make noise, markets assume the Fed’s policy framework and decision making process remain intact. As long as rate expectations and economic data don’t change, risk assets tend to stay supported. In short, the market is signaling confidence that the probe won’t disrupt monetary policy or financial stability.

In the 2024 BRK shareholder's meeting, the last question was on a codicil that Charlie Munger had included in his will. I have never really found any information on it online though. I was just wondering if some of you had other such anecdotes that might not make it to the main press discussions/writings to share.

      "selftext": "Alphabet briefly crossed a $4 trillion market cap following news of its AI partnership with Apple. The deal puts Google’s Gemini models directly into Apple’s ecosystem, which is a pretty significant distribution win given Apple’s user base. From a stock perspective, I’m curious how much of this is already priced in. Alphabet has been on a strong run over the past year, driven by AI optimism, ad recovery, and cloud growth. At $4T, expectations are obviously very high. Some things I’m thinking about: * Does this partnership materially change Alphabet’s long-term revenue outlook, or is it more strategic positioning? * Is this mainly a sentiment boost, or could it lead to measurable earnings impact? * At this valuation, do you see Alphabet as still investable, or more of a hold from here?

I believe that with years of trading experience, there’s a lot of wisdom and unique perspectives to share, and I’m eager to exchange ideas and learn from others. A little about myself: I’m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while. About 50% of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks, but I also like to experiment with growth stocks, tech stocks, and even some small-cap stocks (I know it’s quite aggressive for me, but I keep it within what I’m comfortable with). I’m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we’re bullish on. And if we happen to be in the same city, grabbing a drink together would be a great option too!",

A little about myself I ’ m 60 years old and have been trading for quite a while . About 50 % of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks but I also like to experiment with growth stocks tech stocks and even some smallcap stocks I know it ’ s quite aggressive for me but I keep it within what I ’ m comfortable with . I ’ m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we ’ re bullish on . And if we happen to be in the same city grabbing a drink together would be a great option too"

Based on some quick research, here is roughly what I’m thinking but would love to hear feedback / advice. Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no or little management fees: 50% FZROX (basically VOO but no fees?) 20% FZILX (international emerging markets with no fees) 20% FTEC (fidelity tech etf) 10% FESM (fidelity small cap) What are your thoughts on this? And since I will start with all cash, do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period? It’s roughly 70k USD. Thank you in advance",

Based on some quick research here is roughly what I ’ m thinking but would love to hear feedback advice . Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no_or little management fees 50 % FZROX basically VOO but no_fees 20 % FZILX international emerging markets with no_fees 20 % FTEC fidelity tech etf 10 % FESM fidelity small cap What are your thoughts on this And since I will start with all cash do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period It ’ s roughly 70k USD . Thank you in advance"

Don't think about it too much. Depending how my finances are this year I might dump in £100 every month as a DCA so it's at least over £1k across the year to make it more interesting. I'm not planning on rebalancing as I'd prefer to double down on the winners since I expect some of this will probably go to 0.

Edited to add Ive already got investments in ASTS which is why I havent bothered with that"

      "selftext": "23M - I consider myself a long term investor, but I also enjoy buying individual stocks if something looks interesting. I only ever throw a small amount of money at them, nothing more than I am completely fine losing 100% of. In this case, I purchased $RGTI one time almost exactly a year ago and my current return is 139.74%. Initially I wanted to get into AI, but figured I was too late for any significant gains so I started looking at quantum and kinda just picked $RGTI at random. The problem is that I don’t really see this as a long term hold. I have a couple other positions like this, but not nearly as good of a return. So what can I do with these stocks that I see as popular right now, but not in the future? Do I just set a return value in my head that I would like to see and then sell once I hit that? I’ve never sold any positions before so any advice would be helpful, thanks.",

      "selftext": "Hello, Investors: I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soon-to-be-born daughter's college fund, and \"retirement\" funds for my wife and me. All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers (no options, futures, forex or crypto), which has been very successful for me. But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market (income), and not a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth (savings). My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 (for college fund) to 30 (for \"retirement\" fund) years. I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets, and long-term family planning. Currently I am torn between VT and VTI. Do you have any opinion on either ETF? Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with, and any experience you have had with a similar plan. Also, please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here. I don't want to fall into a trap just because I don't know what I don't know. NOTE: I am not seeking any *advice*. I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day.",

All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers no options futures forex or crypto which has been very successful for me . But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market income and not_a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth savings . My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 for college fund to 30 for retirement fund years . I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets and longterm family planning . Currently I am torn between VT and VTI . Do you have any opinion on either ETF Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with and any experience you have had with a similar plan . Also please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here . I dont want to fall into a trap just because I dont know what I dont know . NOTE I am not_seeking any advice . I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning . Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day ."

Here is the lowdown on why I'm loading up at **$13.85**. # They still own the \"Cool\" part of Boston Dynamics Hyundai gets all the headlines, but SoftBank still holds a **20% stake**. At CES 2026, the new autonomous warehouse tech and the electric Atlas showed that these robots are finally ready for real-world work. If Boston Dynamics goes public, that 20% stake alone makes the current stock price look like a joke. # They have \"Skin in the Game\" everywhere Through the Vision Fund, SoftBank has built an AI empire. They aren't just betting on one horse; they own the whole track. From the chips (ARM) to the brains (OpenAI) to the muscle (Robotics), they are exposed to every single layer of the AI stack. # The Price is a Steal $SFTBY is trading around **$14**, down from its highs of $20+. While Tesla and Nvidia are priced for perfection, SoftBank is trading at a massive discount. It’s an easy entry point for retail investors who missed the first AI boat. # They’re back on \"Offense\" Masa Son (the CEO) recently signaled they are done playing defense. With their massive investment in OpenAI and new partnerships in AI energy infrastructure, they are positioning themselves to be the biggest winner of the \"AI re-rating\" this year. # The Bottom Line If you think robotics and AI are the next trillion-dollar themes, SoftBank is basically a giant Venture Capital fund you can buy on the cheap. The risk? It’s volatile. The reward? Asymmetric as hell. **DYOR (Do Your Own Research), but I’m adding small here.**",

      "title": "UBER fears caused by AVs is the same story as Seaech Ai fears was for Google",
      "selftext": "$UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV (Autonomous Vehicle) fears. It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out. If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player. But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets. Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, hell even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. TLDR: AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV Autonomous Vehicle fears . It ’ s currently trading at a Forward PE of x25 . The market is pricing $ UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy . I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly fears of search AI taking over Google search . In a similar fashion I believe AV is not_here as Uber ’ s competition rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV ’ s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact . Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together . Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US with 1 city partnering with Lyft 2 with Uber and the remaining 2 with themselves constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out . If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it the upside story looks quite convincing . This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not_end up being a winner take all market rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player . But with the TAM for AVs being so large and the payback period for AVs being so high currently it ’ ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does . I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 3035PE as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets . Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out and Uber is left in the dust with no_partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out so will their gross bookings . However I ’ m not_particularly worried . They ’ ve partnered with Nvidia they ’ ve partnered with Avride Costco even Sephora . Feels like something will stick . Position 4 LEAPS waiting for multiples expansion to take profit Yes I know their current PE of 10 is fake due to tax reasons . TLDR Buy Uber AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor ."

I'm on the move all day so I don't have much time to sit and read before I'm brain fried at the end of the day. It would be ideal if I could just get summaries of important events and analyst reports (I'd take AI if I had to) read out so I could listen to it in the car. Bonus points if you could select the specific type of news. I'm more interested in executive summaries of analyst reports than daily happenings. I know there are tons of 'market news' podcasts, but I find these basically useless. Edit: by 'selected stocks' I mean that I can select them. Ideally I could choose: - stocks to cover - roughly the level of detail (executive summary, etc) - what to cover (breaking news, earnings call, analyst reports, etc) - frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)",

It would be ideal if I could just get summaries of important events and analyst reports Id take AI if I had to read out so I could listen to it in the car . Bonus points if you could select the specific type of news . Im more interested in executive summaries of analyst reports than daily happenings . I know there are tons of market news podcasts but I find these basically useless . Edit by selected stocks I mean that I can select them . Ideally I could choose stocks to cover roughly the level of detail executive summary etc what to cover breaking news earnings call analyst reports etc frequency daily weekly monthly"

      "selftext": "Obviously both stocks have performed well (Uber up almost 300% from its 2022 trough and Google doubling from its low in the last 12 months). But with Waymo hitting over 14 million trips in 2025 and expanding to more urban centres in 2026 there’s clearly a heap of operational momentum there. What I can’t figure out is how Uber maintains its current valuation in an autonomous driving world? Seems like we’re definitely headed that way. And currently Uber takes a cut of the drivers fee by providing access to a pool of riders, while the driver provides the car, time, bears the risk, etc. If AV’s displace drivers, and since Uber doesn’t have its own self driving tech, then it would have to licence that tech or buy the cars that had it installed. But in that same world, the developer of that tech (Waymo / Google) would be more likely to monetise its first mover advantage and intellectual property and keep the profits for itself (no licensing). I know you can book a Waymo through the Uber app at the moment, but I kind of see that as Waymo just testing out different routes to market alongside its own app. When it reaches scale why would a customer use Uber over Waymo if a Waymo was a cheaper, safer option (both supported by current data). I’m sure I’m getting this wrong somehow or thinking about it wrong so keen to hear others thoughts on all this.",

Carrying poor investing habits like stock picking, speculation, market timing, and using trading tools like options, margin, leverage into your later years will be too dangerous and costly since you lose the ability to recover from financial losses. While any portfolio can go up by a million percent, it can only go down by 100 percent. So a portfolio should be defensive in nature. It's better to have good investment habits that last your life time than be rewarded early on in your life with your poor investment habits which then turn to destroy you in the end.",

Carrying poor investing habits like stock picking speculation market timing and using trading tools like options margin leverage into your later years will be too dangerous and costly since you lose the ability to recover from financial losses . While any portfolio can go up by a million percent it can only go down by 100 percent . So a portfolio should be defensive in nature . Its better to have good investment habits that last your life time than be rewarded early on in your life with your poor investment habits which then turn to destroy you in the end ."

      "selftext": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy, but hear me out. Over the past year or so, companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP-1 is the \"#1 savor\" for weight lost. Now, I'm not against the drug and I believe that it is very useful. The process of losing weight is different for everyone, and this drug is great in that sense. However......like with all good things, people find a way to abuse them! There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions. Even on social media (TikTok and others), there are doctors, practicing and non practicing, that are actively/heavily *promoting* some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability. Idc about the logistics of it all, I'm just telling you what I see on my social media feeds. In some weird way, I'm getting opioid crisis/Purdue Pharma/Sackler Family vibes. **No**, there are **no direct parallels** necessarily, but things just seem off about this. I think it's probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse. Also, as we all know with medicine, it usually takes years to hear about major side effects, which is normal. On top of that, I'm sure there are people using it in *creative* ways. Basically, I'm betting for even more significant side effects, lack of adherence and misuse/abuse. This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the stores/pharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make....you know what. But before that, I'm sure sudafed was a free-for-all type of situation. Now on to the investing part...I'm not too sure how to do this. Doing some quick research, and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago. I think it's called shorted/shorting? The only difference is that I don't have billions, so I won't lose billions..haha. I'm thinking of it as something on the side, small amounts of money over a period of time. But I think the same principle still applies, right? Obviously, this isn't a short term thing. But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually, and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way. What are your opinions? How should I start? Overall, do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this? Idk...humans always find a way to abuse things, so i don't feel too crazy for this idea.",

Over the past year or so companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP1 is the 1 savor for weight lost . Now Im not_against the drug and I believe that it is very useful . The process of losing weight is different for everyone and this drug is great in that sense . However ...... like with all good things people find a way to abuse them There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions . Even on social media TikTok and others there are doctors practicing and non practicing that are activelyheavily promoting some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability . Idc about the logistics of it all Im just telling you what I see on my social media feeds . In some weird way Im getting opioid crisisPurdue PharmaSackler Family vibes . No there are no direct parallels necessarily but things just seem off about this . I think its probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse . Also as we all know with medicine it usually takes years to hear about major side effects which is normal . On top of that Im sure there are people using it in creative ways . Basically Im betting for even more significant side effects lack of adherence and misuseabuse . This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the storespharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make .... you know what . But before that Im sure sudafed was a freeforall type of situation . Now on to the investing part ... Im not_too sure how to do this . Doing some quick research and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago . I think its called shortedshorting The only difference is that I dont have billions so I wont lose billions .. haha . Im thinking of it as something on the side small amounts of money over a period of time . But I think the same principle still applies right Obviously this isnt a short term thing . But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way . What are your opinions How should I start Overall do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this Idk ... humans always find a way to abuse things so i dont feel too crazy for this idea ."

      "selftext": "Is anyone else watching BitGo? With Circle (+168%) and Bullish (+143%) recently mooning, I decided to do some digging on this one. The Good (Why it might pump): \\- Insane Growth: H1 2025 Revenue hit $4.19B (nearly 4x YoY). \\- Real Assets: They hold $90B+ in custody (mostly BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP, SUI). \\- Big Backers: Goldman and Citi are leading the deal. The Bad (Why I’m worried): Margins are Dead: Despite 4x revenue, net income dropped to $12.6M. Operating costs are eating them alive. Valuation: Expected 4B-5B. Priced for perfection. My IPO strategy: The quick flip. I’m treating this as a short-term flip, not a long-term hold. I’m treating this purely as a short-term arbitrage, not a long-term hold. \\- Enter: At IPO or market open to catch the hype wave. \\- Exit: If it hits +50% on Day 1, I’m selling. \\- Stop Loss: If it breaks issue price, cut it loose. Verdict: Great narrative (First Custody Stock), but the financials are shaky. I plan to profit from the initial volatility, but I won't be holding this long-term. Thoughts?",

This shit didn’t prevent $GOOG from breaking through 4 trillion today. Clearly, we cannot expect a $4-trillion company to grow by another Doble. However, the deepening of NVIDIA's cooperation in AI drug research will definitely enable the stocks with the greatest growth potential and explosive power to more than double in size. Which ONE ? $LLY is indeed the \"king of industrialization\" of AI pharmaceuticals, and has reached a strategic agreement with Nvidia for a joint investment of $1 billion, but there will be no surprises if it is already Prcie in, and I won't go to places with a lot of people. $ILMN is indeed a good alternative, it provides the genomic data needed for AI evolution, and has successfully transformed from a hardware supplier to an AI data service provider, and its business model is transforming to high-profit software and services, but it has doubled from the bottom and is also priced in. So, who will be the next target for capital inflow? I belive $RXRX is the best choice. It is not crowded at present, has stopped falling in the low demand zone, and its share price is also reasonable. Once the rotation reaches $RXRX, there is still a chance to double at least. Recursion is Nvidia's \"core ally\" and a direct equity investment in AI-driven pharmaceutical research. Its Recursion OS is a closed-loop system that integrates vast amounts of proprietary biological imaging data, which represents its core competitive advantage. Recursion is one of the few companies in this sector with a petabyte-scale internal dataset capable of executing AI-driven, closed-loop experiments. Under the leadership of CEO Chris Gibson, $RXRX has strategically focused its efforts on \"translating biology into search problems,\" aligning closely with the logic of Google and Nvidia. Most importantly, $RXRX has a substantial cash reserve that will last through 2027, and it operates BioHive-2, the industry's most advanced AI supercomputer.

      "selftext": "Right now my 401k is 100% in a 2065 target date fund. The mix is about 90% stocks and 10% bonds. i’m in my early 20s so I know based on my age I should lean towards higher risk which means basically no bonds. My roth ira and personal brokerage is all heavily invested in s&p 500 already. So I was planning on switching my 401k to 100% in s&p 500 but I checked today and was surprised that for 2025, my target date fund actually outperformed s&p 500. This made me consider keeping it in a target date fund although I know I really shouldn’t let one year determine my investment plan. But since I already invest heavily in S&P in my other accounts, would it actually be smart to keep my 401k in a target date fund? Edit: Thanks for the advice. I decided to change to a 70% S&P 500 and 30% international in my 401k. But have a follow up question about whether i should do automatic rebalancing in 401k and how frequent it should happen. Here’s the follow up post",

      "title": "What I learned from Tracking My Investment Calls in 2025",
      "selftext": "As a long time investor, I realized this year that I often had tens if not hundreds of strong calls or at least \"hunches\" throughout a year. I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to \"rationalize\" away. So this year, I decided to record and publish every \"buy\" in my mind throughout the year, along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision (and timestamp the day of the call). In order to systematize the process, I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly. Winners would be categorized as up more than 5% throughout the period. Neutral picks are within 5% up or down (dead money, or recent calls mainly). Losers were tagged as greater than a 5% loss. All picks (regardless of June or December timestamp) would be equally weighted. An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances. **The Results:** I ended up writing 35 \"calls\" between April and December 2025. Price on the day I published vs today. No edits. No pretending I sold the top. No “would’ve sized this differently.” Just the equal weight returns. Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly **42%**. **Winners/Neutral/Losers** * **Up more than 5%:** **18 / 35 (51%)** * **Neutral (±5%):** **5 / 35 (14%)** * **Down more than 5%:** **12 / 35 (34%)** Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy: Diversification among convicted buys is not optional for stock pickers. Yes, a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out, but some flat out did not and were anchors to the portfolio. Even if you are \"right\" over the long term, you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost, timing matters. Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance. One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come. (even at a 1/35th allocation) **A handful of names did almost all the work.** JMIA (+478%) RKLB (+288%) HOOD (+167%) AMD (+143%) SOFI (+142%). **A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns:** HNST (-52%) BMNR (-49%) COIN (-21%) HIMS (-21%) MELI (-17%) PYPL (-16%) **Another important point of discovery:** Going against the common sentiment in a stock, is right a heck of a lot more than it's wrong. My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year (AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand), Estee Lauder Stock trading as if it's going to file bankruptcy, the death of Google by chatgpt, so on and so forth. **Lastly,** although not being able \"to sell\" certainly cost me real performance over this experiment, it also helped immensely with discipline. Not panic selling long-term convictions over a headline and inversely not selling the first 15% pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times. **Yes,** there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry, but it's often much later than you think. Overall, it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026. Regardless of the returns or bull market luck, I became an immensely better investor throughout the process. Let me know if you have any questions about the process, results, or in general.",

      "selftext_processed": "As a long time investor I realized this year that I often had tens if not_hundreds of strong calls or at least hunches throughout a year . I also realized that I tended to only strongly remember the biggest winners and the occasional loser that I would tend to rationalize away . So this year I decided to record and publish every buy in my mind throughout the year along with my thesis and numbers behind the decision and timestamp the day of the call . In order to systematize the process I followed a strict set of rules to interpret the results fairly . Winners would be categorized as up more than 5 % throughout the period . Neutral picks are within 5 % up or down dead money or recent calls mainly . Losers were tagged as greater than a 5 % loss . All picks regardless of June or December timestamp would be equally weighted . An Equal Weight return would be calculated from the aggregate of all performances . The Results I ended up writing 35 calls between April and December 2025 . Price on the day I published vs today . No_edits . No_pretending I sold the top . No_ “ would ’ ve sized this differently. ” Just the equal weight returns . Over this period the 35 theses returned roughly 42 % . WinnersNeutralLosers Up more than 5 % 18 35 51 % Neutral ±5 % 5 35 14 % Down more than 5 % 12 35 34 % Here are a couple of notes that completely changed how I view my personal investing strategy Diversification among convicted buys is not_optional for stock pickers . Yes a lot of my highest conviction stocks worked out but some flat out did not_and were anchors to the portfolio . Even if you are right over the long term you might lose for years and waste a tremendous amount of opportunity cost timing matters . Asymmetric setups and winners are everything to market outperformance . One high conviction investment at the right time can buy you market beating performance for several years to come . even at a 135th allocation A handful of names did almost all the work . JMIA 478 % RKLB 288 % HOOD 167 % AMD 143 % SOFI 142 % . A handful of names also did the majority of damage to equal weight returns HNST 52 % BMNR 49 % COIN 21 % HIMS 21 % MELI 17 % PYPL 16 % Another important point of discovery Going against the common sentiment in a stock is right a heck of a lot more than its wrong . My biggest winners as well as convictions came during capitulations this year AMD selling off under 100 despite massive pipelines and insatiable AI demand Estee Lauder Stock trading as if its going to file bankruptcy the death of Google by chatgpt so on and so forth . Lastly although not_being able to sell certainly cost me real performance over this experiment it also helped immensely with discipline . Not_panic selling longterm convictions over a headline and inversely not_selling the first 15 % pop in a long term hold due to frustration also turned small winners into monsters at times . Yes there are undoubtedly times to sell high performers when they surpass long term targets in a hurry but its often much later than you think . Overall it was an awesome exercise and I highly recommend trying it for yourself in 2026 . Regardless of the returns or bull market luck I became an immensely better investor throughout the process . Let me know if you have any questions about the process results or in general ."

      "selftext": "I moved my 50kish (between Roth and Rollover IRA) from my old employers retirement plan over to Schwab savings account \\[\\[\\[EDIT - I've since moved them over to Fidelity but transfer not completed yet\\]\\]. I chose not to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later, which is now. I've gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I can't help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations. I don't trust them. I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity that's still with them. It's 51% domestic stock, 38% foreign stock, 10% bonds (roughly). From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96% with Index of 22.98%. So it's actually 18k+ right now, not 15 as I thought it was last time I checked. I also have a bunch of Ethereum (I already withdrew my initial investment) and it's valued anywhere between 150,000-200,000 based on the numbers of the past month. I'm not banking on it, it's just an extra atm. What should I do with this? I have no kids, single at 37, very little debt (just vehicle) but I'm unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k\\~ salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment. I have about 30k+ in savings. I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner. Any and every advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Edit: I do not own my home, I'm back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation. I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact. I'm not counting on any inheritance. Though if I'm able to square my parents a way where they're safe and secure through the rest of their lives, they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there. Additional Edit: I've now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess 'lets goooo'. I dunno. Just tryin to survive here while having a good time",

I chose not_to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later which is now . Ive gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I cant help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations . I dont trust them . I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity thats still with them . Its 51 % domestic stock 38 % foreign stock 10 % bonds roughly . From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96 % with Index of 22.98 % . So its actually 18k right now not_15 as I thought it was last time I checked . I also have a bunch of Ethereum I already withdrew my initial investment and its valued anywhere between 150000200000 based on the numbers of the past month . Im not_banking on it its just an extra atm . What should I do with this I have no_kids single at 37 very little debt just vehicle but Im unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment . I have about 30k in savings . I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner . Any and every advice would be appreciated . Thank you . Edit I do not_own my home Im back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation . I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact . Im not_counting on any inheritance . Though if Im able to square my parents a way where theyre safe and secure through the rest of their lives they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there . Additional Edit Ive now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess lets goooo . I dunno . Just tryin to survive here while having a good time"

I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once). I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once. On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a \"Millionaire Tax\" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in \"investment\" income? I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \\*when\\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade. For example, today's losses came from getting \"caught\" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened..... Half of today's \"Loss\" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year. Any questions, happy to discuss.",

      "title": "ICE backlash creates new volatility risk for prison stocks, big tech, and hotel chains as public pressure intensifies",
      "selftext": "Source - [ Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns. Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels. Private prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities. Big tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial. Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere. This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns . Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a volatility factor where reputational damage employee dissent and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels . Private prison operators GEO Group GEO and CoreCivic CXW carry the highest concentration risk with GEO deriving roughly 40 % of revenue from ICErelated operations . Despite benefiting from postelection enforcement expansion both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities . Big tech names including Palantir PLTR and Amazon AMZN face a different threat internal resistance . Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts while Amazons AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial . Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sectors exposure . Marriott MAR and Hilton HLT face what the report calls brand contagion risk where franchiselevel decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts . Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere . This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts dont automatically mean safe revenue anymore ."

      "selftext": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views. No idea why. Wasn't selling anything, wasn't pumping tickers, just sharing my thinking. Whatever. Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently that's a problem. **What I think is happening:** * Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there. * Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is. * Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment. * That buys a window where risk assets can run. **Then last night happened:** * DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates. * Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" * He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates. * Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. \"Sell America\" trade came back. * But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business. **What this means:** * Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead. * Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026. * Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures. **Path one, the pump:** * Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up. * Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat. * Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips. * Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well. **Path two, the collapse:** * Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions. * \"Sell America\" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together. * Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance. * Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates. * Everything falls apart. **Here's the thing though:** * Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less. * Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios. **Signals I'm watching:** * Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple \"Sell America\" days in a row means it's real. * Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess. * Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done. * Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice. * Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal. * Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something. **When I get out:** * Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours * Defense budgets stall * Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus * Actual military conflict, not just talk **Where I'm positioned:** * Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing * Mix of shares and longer dated options * Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly **Bottom line:** * Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026 * Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies * Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore I'm comfortable with those odds.",

      "selftext_processed": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views . No_idea why . Wasnt selling anything wasnt pumping tickers just sharing my thinking . Whatever . Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently thats a problem . What I think is happening Trump needs the market to rip into midterms . Thats it . Thats the whole thing . Everything else flows from there . Tax cuts deregulation defense spending rate cuts cash handouts to the base . He needs wins he can point to and stock market go up is the easiest win there is . Meanwhile nobody_wants to test him right now . Maduro got snatched . That sent a message . Irans not_going to do anything crazy . Putins going to wait and see . Chinas playing nice for the moment . That buys a window where risk assets can run . Then last night happened DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell . The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed . The actual reason according to Powell himself is that Trump wants lower rates . Powell posted a video Sunday night . Direct quote The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president . He said that . On camera . The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates . Gold hit record highs overnight . Dollar sold off . Futures dumped . Sell America trade came back . But by midday stocks had mostly recovered . Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs . Selloff panic stabilization back to business . What this means Short term volatility . Markets dont like Fed independence being threatened . Chop ahead . Medium term probably bullish If Trump gets his rate cuts whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May thats rocket fuel for stocks . Bad for the dollar bad for inflation eventually but good for equities through 2026 . Long term this is where it splits into two very different futures . Path one the pump Trump gets what he wants . Rates come down . Housing unfreezes . Consumer spending picks up . Defense budget passes . $ 1.5T proposed . Counterdrone AI infrastructure domestic manufacturing all eat . Deregulation everywhere . Crypto rips . Tech rips . Everything rips . Market pumps into midterms . People with risk assets do well . Path two the collapse Trump doesnt stop at pressuring the Fed . He breaks it . Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions . Sell America stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend . Bonds dollar and stocks all falling together . Or he goes further . Starts taking territory seizing assets from other countries because the spending isnt sustainable otherwise . World wants to respond but cant at first because US military dominance . Internal resistance builds . Coup paralysis who knows . Or we stumble into a real conflict . China moves on Taiwan . Russia escalates . Iran miscalculates . Everything falls apart . Heres the thing though Even in path two some stuff still works . Defense doesnt go down during wars . AI infrastructure still matters . Critical minerals become more critical not_less . Unless it goes nuclear . Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios . Signals Im watching Fed independence . If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early major red flag . Multiple Sell America days in a row means its real . Defense budget . $ 1.5T passes defense names keep working . Stalls or gets blocked time to reassess . Supreme Court on Lisa Cook . Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors . He wins Fed independence is done . Credit card cap . Trump floated 10 % today . Banks cratered . If this happens hes willing to break things for short term juice . Foreign treasury holders . China and Japan start dumping in size thats the real signal . Gold . Already at records . Keeps ripping while stocks chop smart money is positioning for something . When I get out Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days not_hours Defense budgets stall Bonds dollar stocks all falling together for a week plus Actual military conflict not_just talk Where Im positioned Themes defense AI infrastructure critical minerals domestic semis some housing Mix of shares and longer dated options Stuff that wins if Trump pumps but doesnt completely die if things get ugly Bottom line Bull case market pumps into midterms I take profits in 2026 Bear case system breaks but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies Worst case nukes and nobody_cares about stonks anymore Im comfortable with those odds ."

      "selftext": "Hello all, I was hoping you could help me figure out how to rebalance my portfolio. I'm ~40yo, make around $180/yr in a HCOL area. I'm currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation. It's my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades. Whether due to normal economics, political turmoil, dedollarization, end of reserve currency status, purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets. To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner. Here's a brief summary of my accounts. some of the data is obfuscated but you can get the point. Accounts are over multiple lines and all of the rows of that similar name are the accounts holdings. | Account Name | Symbol | Description | Quantity | Current Value (rounded) | Percent Of Account | |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:| | Main Brokerage | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$32,800 | 9.19% | | Main Brokerage | VTI | VANGUARD INDEX FDS VANGUARD TOTAL STK MKT ETF | 601.722 | ~$203,900 | 57.11% | | Main Brokerage | VXUS | VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX FUND | 129.317 | ~$10,000 | 2.80% | | Main Brokerage | BND | VANGUARD BD INDEX FDS TOTAL BND MRKT | 166.292 | ~$12,300 | 3.46% | | Main Brokerage | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 518.761 | ~$98,000 | 27.44% | | Rollover IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Rollover IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 2311.105 | ~$436,400 | 100.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 520 | ~$98,200 | 100.00% | | IRA MOM | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | IRA MOM | FPIFX | FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2020 INVESTOR | 926.689 | ~$15,800 | 59.71% | | IRA MOM | FFFAX | FIDELITY FREEDOM RETIREMENT FUND | 937.059 | ~$10,600 | 40.29% | | 401K | FXAIX | FID 500 INDEX | 690.839 | ~$165,600 | 100.00% | | HYSA | | | | ~$100,000 | 100.00% | I was thinking that in tax advantaged accounts it would be good to move to VXUS or FTIHX. Both total international funds. My goal is to have international exposure. But I also don't want to lose out on growth. Maybe in the Roth IRA have a fund that is more aggressive like Contrafund or Blue chip or tech select. any advice would be great and appreciated. I just don't want to make a mistake and you I know are smarter than I. Thank you",

Im currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation . Its my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades . Whether due to normal economics political turmoil dedollarization end of reserve currency status purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets . To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner .

      "title": "Five Cheap AI Stocks To Watch When The Sector Rotates",
      "selftext": "When AI heats up, low-priced names often move first because traders pile into what is liquid and headline-sensitive. This is the short list I watch under $6. My 5 AI tickers to watch: **- BBAI** **- REKR** **- RIME** **- NOTE** **- GCT** Why I keep them: RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real run-rate metrics. The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M during 2025 and cited $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike. NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play \"AI SaaS\" sentiment without needing it to be in logistics. When software and AI sentiment improves, names like this can move on category flows. REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play. It is not pure freight optimization, but it is connected to the same idea: AI applied to real-world mobility systems, which can catch a sector bid. Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI, or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates? Do your own homework.",

My 5 AI tickers to watch BBAI REKR RIME NOTE GCT Why I keep them RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real runrate metrics . The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220 % from $ 2.5M to over $ 8M during 2025 and cited $ 15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions source type company press release . That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike . NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play AI SaaS sentiment without needing it to be in logistics . When software and AI sentiment improves names like this can move on category flows . REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play . It is not_pure freight optimization but it is connected to the same idea AI applied to realworld mobility systems which can catch a sector bid . Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates Do your own homework ."

This escalated worries about the Fed's independence from political influence to a new level and added to a frenetic start to 2026, which has already seen the U.S. capture Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro and ramp up talk of taking control of Greenland. Gold hit a record high of $4,600 on Monday, while silver also set a new peak, as a criminal probe by the Trump administration into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sent investors back into the asset viewed as a safe haven. Spot gold jumped 1.7% to $4,584.12 per ounce by 1159 GMT, after earlier hitting a record high of $4,600.33. U.S. gold futures for February delivery gained 2.1% to $4,595.",

I earn around $1,800 a week after tax including overtime, and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $47 to $55 an hour. I’m posting this because I want honest feedback, not validation. Where am I being naive? Where am I overthinking it? Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me? My general philosophy with money is this: build slowly, test myself honestly, and earn the right to press harder later. I’m playing the long game, but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it. I’m ambitious and not satisfied with “average good outcomes”. I want more, but not recklessly. I’m very aware that consistency beats intensity, and that most people fail because they scale too early, not too late. So this is how I currently run things. I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI, based on about 90% of my income so there’s always buffer. Weekly it looks like this: $400 for core living expenses, $160 for lifestyle, $300 towards a house deposit, $100 for travel or bigger purchases, and $600 into investing. Total is $1,560 a week. Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading. Every category has its own savings account. All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday. No rolling balances, no bullshit. Lifestyle is intentionally tight. Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate, but I work a physical job and I’m not exactly living it up mid-week anyway. I’ve built in room for excess because I know this isn’t sustainable forever. When income grows and life changes, I plan to let myself breathe more. I also keep an $8k emergency fund that I don’t touch, and I’ve got about $7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I’m no longer adding to. For investing, I put $600 a week into US ETFs. Roughly 40% into VGT, 40% into VTI, and 20% into VXUS. This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone. I don’t touch it emotionally. No tinkering, no panic moves, no chasing whatever’s hot this month. Alongside that, I run a small swing trading account, about $2k. This is not income to me. It’s training. I treat trading as skill development, pattern recognition, and learning capital preservation before there’s ever any talk of real leverage. I trade end-of-day swings since I’m in Australia trading US markets. I focus on sector strength, tight consolidations, breakouts and pullbacks, defined risk, and high ADR stocks. Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency. If I ever scale it, the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs, not lifestyle or savings. I’m not relying on trading to save me. I’m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it. Medium term, the next 3–5 years, the goals are straightforward. Keep building a house deposit, buy a property when it actually makes sense, keep ETF compounding going, stay disciplined with trading, and increase income through higher paying roles, specialisation, or side businesses. I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don’t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever. I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn’t care. Fatigue, boredom, temptation, and bad decisions are real. So I’ll ask again, honestly: where am I getting this wrong? Where am I playing it too safe? If you were 20, working a physical job, and thinking long term, what would you change? Am I underutilising my income, or am I actually protecting my future properly? Give me your worst. You old bastards.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m 20 from Australia qualified in a physically demanding trade . I work early mornings long days . I earn around $ 1800 a week after tax including overtime and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $ 47 to $ 55 an hour . I ’ m posting this because I want honest feedback not_validation . Where am I being naive Where am I overthinking it Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me My general philosophy with money is this build slowly test myself honestly and earn the right to press harder later . I ’ m playing the long game but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it . I ’ m ambitious and not_satisfied with “ average good outcomes ” . I want more but not_recklessly . I ’ m very aware that consistency beats intensity and that most people fail because they scale too early not_too late . So this is how I currently run things . I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI based on about 90 % of my income so there ’ s always buffer . Weekly it looks like this $ 400 for core living expenses $ 160 for lifestyle $ 300 towards a house deposit $ 100 for travel or bigger purchases and $ 600 into investing . Total is $ 1560 a week . Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading . Every category has its own savings account . All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday . No_rolling balances no_bullshit . Lifestyle is intentionally tight . Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate but I work a physical job and I ’ m not_exactly living it up midweek anyway . I ’ ve built in room for excess because I know this isn ’ t sustainable forever . When income grows and life changes I plan to let myself breathe more . I also keep an $ 8k emergency fund that I don ’ t touch and I ’ ve got about $ 7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I ’ m no_longer adding to . For investing I put $ 600 a week into US ETFs . Roughly 40 % into VGT 40 % into VTI and 20 % into VXUS . This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone . I don ’ t touch it emotionally . No_tinkering no_panic moves no_chasing whatever ’ s hot this month . Alongside that I run a small swing trading account about $ 2k . This is not_income to me . It ’ s training . I treat trading as skill development pattern recognition and learning capital preservation before there ’ s ever any talk of real leverage . I trade endofday swings since I ’ m in Australia trading US markets . I focus on sector strength tight consolidations breakouts and pullbacks defined risk and high ADR stocks . Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency . If I ever scale it the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs not_lifestyle or savings . I ’ m not_relying on trading to save me . I ’ m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it . Medium term the next 3–5 years the goals are straightforward . Keep building a house deposit buy a property when it actually makes sense keep ETF compounding going stay disciplined with trading and increase income through higher paying roles specialisation or side businesses . I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don ’ t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever . I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn ’ t care . Fatigue boredom temptation and bad decisions are real . So I ’ ll ask again honestly where am I getting this wrong Where am I playing it too safe If you were 20 working a physical job and thinking long term what would you change Am I underutilising my income or am I actually protecting my future properly Give me your worst . You old bastards ."

Manus was founded by Chinese engineers and backed by Chinese investors, the company moved its headquarters to Singapore in June last year. Its product became unavailable in China in July. Around the same time, Manus reportedly laid off its Chinese staff and closed its offices in the country. “Manus left China to pursue international market opportunities just before they materialized,” Lian Jye Su, a Singapore-based tech analyst who monitors AI startups in the region at Omdia, told *Rest of World*. “Its exodus has left the impression that Chinese tech startups can only get international attention if they operate outside of China.” Because of the US-China rivalry, which is causing this strict scrutiny of the deal has, what does it mean for the Chinese startups? Right now, they have the option to either operate within China or give up China to operate internationally. Should this be a concern for China i.e the risk of loosing their talent? Should Chines govt. or investors provide Chinese startups the capital they need so that the Chinese startups do not have to look at Western/ US investments?",

      "title": "Figma Bull Case",
      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

Don ’ t expect any big numbers I have a small account 10K The inverse iron condor strat So a regular iron condor is simple enough . An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit defined riskreward long theta short Vega delta neutral at start . The DTE is your choice but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty which makes sense you want the price to stay between your short strikes and thus let the entire spread expire worthless . The other wellknown strat is a reverse or long iron condor which is an otm debit put and call spread and this time it ’ s short theta long Vega delta neutral at start . This one you want the price to move drastically up or down . With me so far Congrats you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly . So what ’ s different with the inverse iron condor Simple my problem was this I hate entering a trade for a debit . And my thesis Markets don ’ t stay the same in a longer period of time . Solution open a fully itm credit callput spread for a net CREDIT short theta LONG Vega delta neutral at start and we want price to move drastically now . Give yourself a bit of time for market to move 95DTE approx and bob ’ s your uncle . But you tell me you ’ re really dumb . You could ’ ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same PL outlook . Aren ’ t you even thinking about early assignment Why yes dear reader . You are absolutely correct . Because of early assignment risk I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is Europeanstyle . As for the condor I forgor 💀 really that ’ s the only reason . Do a regular credit condor if you want I ’ m not_your mom . So to sum up buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry same strike widths apart . Market dumps you win . Market rallies you win Market flatlines you lose . If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT ’ s help I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole . For now here ’ s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don ’ t want to mess around with early assignment risk ."

We’ve already lifted to $23, but I’m not even thinking about selling. The \"MBS God-Candle\" just ignited. Trump just ordered a $200B mortgage bond buy, pushing 30-year rates under 6% overnight. The Trump administration is perfectly aligned with $RKT because housing affordability is a top agenda item. Institutional giants and advocates like Bill Pulte and Bill Ackman are already vocal about crushing these spreads to force affordability. The real alpha for 2026 is Rocket’s transformation into a tech-driven financial powerhouse. By integrating the Redfin search funnel and Mr. Cooper servicing book, they now own the entire Search-to-Close lifecycle. As the market realizes Rocket scales like a SaaS company rather than a cyclical bank, I'm expecting massive multiple expansion. I like the stock even more than before. I still like rockets. See you regards on the moon. 🚀🚀🚀",

We ’ ve already lifted to $ 23 but I ’ m not_even thinking about selling . The MBS GodCandle just ignited . Trump just ordered a $ 200B mortgage bond buy pushing 30year rates under 6 % overnight . The Trump administration is perfectly aligned with $ RKT because housing affordability is a top agenda item . Institutional giants and advocates like Bill Pulte and Bill Ackman are already vocal about crushing these spreads to force affordability . The real alpha for 2026 is Rocket ’ s transformation into a techdriven financial powerhouse . By integrating the Redfin search funnel and Mr. Cooper servicing book they now own the entire SearchtoClose lifecycle . As the market realizes Rocket scales like a SaaS company rather than a cyclical bank Im expecting massive multiple expansion . I like the stock even more than before . I still like rockets .

      "selftext": "How many people are honestly still investing in stocks *just* to study fundamentals Because, honestly, I’m starting to doubt it. What’s the point of investing in the first place? Isn’t it to maximize returns? Isn’t it to beat inflation? I trade more on the short-term side, and yeah, it’s been working for me. But the moment I mention I’ve owned Tesla or ASTS, someone always jumps in like Bro, that’s just speculation Okay. So what if it is? People love to talk about value. Like unless you’re talking earnings reports, P/E ratios, or DCF models, it somehow doesn’t count as real value. But to me, value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money *within a level of risk I’m comfortable with*? If a stock makes me money, improves my life, and moves me closer to the future I want, then yeah that’s a good stock *to me* Value isn’t something written in textbooks. It’s not just numbers in a spreadsheet. It shows up in your account balance. And as for the word gambler I see it thrown around on Reddit all the time. You’re a gambler You’ll blow up eventually You don’t understand investing Fine. I’ll say it. In a way, I *am* a gambler.But I’m not gambling on a quick jackpot. I’m gambling on being a better father. On my kids getting a better education. On them having the freedom to do what they actually want in life. On them carrying less debt and less financial pressure.I’m gambling on the future. And I’m gambling with responsibility. So what about you?You’re gambling too. You’re gambling that the system always works. That markets stay rational. That the theories you learned never break.If your so called “value investing” keeps you stuck, while my “speculation” keeps pushing me closer to my goals, then who’s really closer to the point of investing?And if that makes me a gambler then fuck it. I’m a gambler what the hell are you？？？？？？？？",

Like unless you ’ re talking earnings reports PE ratios or DCF models it somehow doesn ’ t count as real value . But to me value is pretty simple Can this stock make me money within a level of risk I ’ m comfortable with If a stock makes me money improves my life and moves me closer to the future I want then yeah that ’ s a good stock to me Value isn ’ t something written in textbooks .

      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls. Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not a financial professional in any capacity.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."

      "selftext": "I currently run my portfolio and trades through a self-directed investment account through my bank. I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app. It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock. Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned, I and considering moving everything to robinhood. Almost every picture I see of other’s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining user-friendly. The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky. It only loads through a pop-up window, and closes every time I leave the app. It does not provide enough of information on the tearsheet, so I have to go in and out, reloading the page every time I am researching. There are also some stocks that are not available to purchase when I search for them (KRKNF). The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock. I may be misinformed, so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood. My understanding is that yes, robinhood is FDIC insured, but behind the screen, when you “buy” a stock, you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool. When you “buy” a stock on the app, Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood. What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform? Would it be worth transferring my portfolio? Additionally, are there any other secure, FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked?",

      "selftext_processed": "I currently run my portfolio and trades through a selfdirected investment account through my bank . I set it up that way when I was first getting started and I liked the idea of having most of my finances on one app . It was also directly connected to my checking account which made for quick transfers when I wanted to throw some extra cash on a stock . Now that my portfolio has grown and I am becoming a bit more seasoned I and considering moving everything to robinhood . Almost every picture I see of other ’ s portfolios is from robinhood and it seems pretty robust while remaining userfriendly . The investment interface through the bank is extremely clunky . It only loads through a popup window and closes every time I leave the app . It does not_provide enough of information on the tearsheet so I have to go in and out reloading the page every time I am researching . There are also some stocks that are not_available to purchase when I search for them KRKNF . The only thing I really love about it is that I own the stock . I may be misinformed so I am looking for what the fine people of Reddit have to say about Robinhood . My understanding is that yes robinhood is FDIC insured but behind the screen when you “ buy ” a stock you are really just putting money into essentially a giant pool . When you “ buy ” a stock on the app Robinhood purchases the stock and holds it for your account but it really belongs to robinhood . What is the general consensus of Robinhood as a trading platform Would it be worth transferring my portfolio Additionally are there any other secure FDIC insured platforms that are generally liked"

      "title": "Looking for portfolio feedback- GGUS/UGL/Senior AUD bank bonds",
      "selftext": "I'd like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this long-term strategy as an Australian investor (40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% AUD cash/senior bank bonds, 10% aussie miners/personal stock picks) with 20% bands, yearly rebalancing), where it could go wrong, and for constructive critique. The basic premise is that over the next 7-10 years, the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD (mean-reversion), and a number of other considerations, like higher US inflation to be expected. This is for a number of reasons, mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold, but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower. In addition, I do not see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debt-to-GDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal. US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of Medicare/Social Security, and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze, so only inflation or higher taxation are viable long-term solutions (unless the US gets rid of the above). Given the political paralysis, higher taxation is unlikely, and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office (besides tariffs, which do not meaningfully compensate for tax cuts). GGUS is 80-100% overall AUD currency-hedged S&P500 exposure, UGL is 60%ish USD-denominated gold exposure, and the 20% cash/Australian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash. There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered, and how this portfolio would play out. \\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- **1. War/Significant geopolitical event** GGUS will likely crash, UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos. Enables rebalancing. I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease (climate refugees etc.). **2. Persistent US inflation** Since I'm hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not a major concern for me, and since economically companies price based on inflation, I'm economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates (expected in the near term). Gold is also useful for this. **3. Stock market crash (bubble popping)** This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping. In the near term, stocks will fall. Gold may be mixed effects, there for rebalancing. Cash also there for rebalancing. Appears there's a long-term mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful. **4. Deflation** I don't believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in- central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates. However, under this scenario, the portfolio does lose considerable value. **5. Tariff death spiral** Stocks will crash, gold will likely soar as it's not dependent on government policy. Rebalance, buy the dip, TACO. **6. Bond vigilantes** This is possible in the next 5-10 years if inflation is too high and long-term bond investors are not happy with a dovish Fed's low interest rates. Cash/short-term senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing, and I'm happy to hold. Gold/cash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS. **7. The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds** I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio. Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting, slightly higher, but an additional risk I'm willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash. **8. Gold prices decrease** This is possible- gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing, likely because of saturation from miners. Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL, I may experience more losses as a result, but for me it's worth the insurance policy. In the long term, it's an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease, and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation. So I'm fine with this risk. \\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Are there any future likely scenarios I haven't considered? I've also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past (\\~14-15%/annum) with okay drawdowns, not a predictor of future returns, but still. Ideally, I still would've preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40% portion (for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay), but that doesn't really exist in a liquid form. Perhaps the only semi-likely scenario I've thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together, but that's unlikely. **TL;DR:** I'm a young early-20's Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually. I'm stress testing a 40% GGUS/30% UGL/20% senior Australian bank bonds (QPON)/10% fun money portfolio (with 20% bands and yearly rebalancing) and would like some feedback/thoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term. The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes, and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons (see US debt-to-GDP), enabling higher returns in currency-hedged leveraged S&P500 and gold. If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF I'd be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40% portion.",

      "selftext_processed": "Id like to ask for some feedback regarding the thesis behind this longterm strategy as an Australian investor 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % AUD cashsenior bank bonds 10 % aussie minerspersonal stock picks with 20 % bands yearly rebalancing where it could go wrong and for constructive critique . The basic premise is that over the next 710 years the USD is expected to depreciate relative to the AUD meanreversion and a number of other considerations like higher US inflation to be expected . This is for a number of reasons mainly due to geopolitical risk as countries move away from US treasuries and into gold but also due to the stated and expected policy of the US government that they want the dollar to be lower . In addition I do not_see a politically feasible way for the US in the medium term to rebalance the debttoGDP ratio without higher levels of inflation than normal . US spending seems relatively fixed in terms of MedicareSocial Security and is only expected to increase over the coming decades due to a demographic squeeze so only inflation or higher taxation are viable longterm solutions unless the US gets rid of the above . Given the political paralysis higher taxation is unlikely and very unlikely for the next 3 years while Trump is in office besides tariffs which do not_meaningfully compensate for tax cuts . GGUS is 80100 % overall AUD currencyhedged SP500 exposure UGL is 60 % ish USDdenominated gold exposure and the 20 % cashAustralian senior bank bonds are used for rebalancing when there is a crash . There are a few possible bad scenarios I have considered and how this portfolio would play out . 1 . WarSignificant geopolitical event GGUS will likely crash UGL will likely rocket as a safe asset in times of global chaos . Enables rebalancing . I expect this will be more likely in the medium term as the effects of climate change and productive capacity in the Global South decrease climate refugees etc .. 2 . Persistent US inflation Since Im hedged with the AUD in GGUS this is not_a major concern for me and since economically companies price based on inflation Im economically long higher levels of inflation and lower interest rates expected in the near term . Gold is also useful for this . 3 . Stock market crash bubble popping This would likely be due to higher interest rates reducing discount rates or a bubble popping . In the near term stocks will fall . Gold may be mixed effects there for rebalancing . Cash also there for rebalancing . Appears theres a longterm mean reversion between stocks and gold but generally these are uncorrelated assets which is why this is useful . 4 . Deflation I dont believe that this is likely in the macroeconomic environment we are in central banks would be likely to decrease interest rates . However under this scenario the portfolio does lose considerable value . 5 . Tariff death spiral Stocks will crash gold will likely soar as its not_dependent on government policy . Rebalance buy the dip TACO . 6 . Bond vigilantes This is possible in the next 510 years if inflation is too high and longterm bond investors are not_happy with a dovish Feds low interest rates . Cashshortterm senior Australian bank bonds allow for rebalancing and Im happy to hold . Goldcash allows for rebalancing into the significantly depressed GGUS . 7 . The big 4 Australian banks default on senior bank bonds I think this is very unlikely and would probably mean I have bigger problems to worry about than my portfolio . Similar level of risk to the Australian government defaulting slightly higher but an additional risk Im willing to take for the slightly higher yield on cash . 8 . Gold prices decrease This is possible gold seems to have short upswings and long periods where it does nothing_likely because of saturation from miners . Given volatility decay losses associated with UGL I may experience more losses as a result but for me its worth the insurance policy . In the long term its an uncorrelated asset which will appreciate in value as mining grades will decrease and will be a useful store of value which eventually appreciates to match inflation or better than inflation . So Im fine with this risk . Are there any future likely scenarios I havent considered Ive also backtested this portfolio and it seems to have done pretty well in the past 1415 % annum with okay drawdowns not_a predictor of future returns but still . Ideally I still wouldve preferred a 2x or 3x VT LETF instead for the 40 % portion for broad international diversification and lower daily volatility eating into volatility decay but that doesnt really exist in a liquid form . Perhaps the only semilikely scenario Ive thought of is that the US govt gets its shit together but thats unlikely . TLDR Im a young early20s Australian investor looking to FIRE eventually . Im stress testing a 40 % GGUS30 % UGL20 % senior Australian bank bonds QPON10 % fun money portfolio with 20 % bands and yearly rebalancing and would like some feedbackthoughts on where it could go wrong in the long term . The simplest idea is that gold and stocks are uncorrelated assets and allow for yearly rebalancing for tax purposes and the USD will have to inflate more than normal in the longer term due to political reasons see US debttoGDP enabling higher returns in currencyhedged leveraged SP500 and gold . If anyone does find a suitable 2.5x or 3x VT LETF Id be very happy to switch to that instead for the 40 % portion ."

      "selftext": "RFK has released his idea of what the food pyramid should look like, and honestly disregarding my thoughts on how i feel about it i think there's a big play here in 3 stocks that honestly have risen quite a bit over the past few weeks but I dont think the momentum is even here yet. These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava, down over like 70% from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend.. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago. 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs. Was down a half a month ago. Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI.. so its a good sign I think? And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and. Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I haven't even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if they're still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me",

These stocks are Cava Chipotle Sweet greens Cava down over like 70 % from its ath but seems to have broken out of its down trend .. Sweet greens is even more crazy ipo was at 60 dollars 3 years ago and its at near its all time low at 8 dollars but was 5 dollars a few weeks ago . 1 billion market cap Cmg has been on the market longest but is the most stable price action and down a third from its highs . Was down a half a month ago . Imo Cava and sg probably double from here I know Sweet greens the founder is still with the company and Cava is too i think and tbey are trying to grow their company and sweet greens dude has said they were implementing AI .. so its a good sign I think And idk i think people are still going more and more outdoors now I dont have any position as I just got stoned and am browsing reddit but honestly now that that I see rfks rendition of a pyramid which has meat and vegetables at the top and whole grains at tbe bottom but the greens and meat are equals weight it seems well that screams Cava to me but like im in canada and have never_even visited a Cava or sg store haha but idk i might open a position in cava or sg on a red day But feel free if you like this set up and . Eed to do more DD to go to chatgpt or Germaine and ask it what company is most likely to succeed over a 5 year time frame based on profitability and future market strategy and maybe like what are companies plans to expand both in the u.s. and globally Also plz comment on why this is a good investment or bad investment esp if food quality has gone down recently cause I havent even been to a Chipotle in a min to see if theyre still packed like they used to be but maybe Chipotle sounds good tomorrow but I dont have a single one near me"

      "title": "My Clients Buying Silver: A Criticism",
      "selftext": "I’ll summarize my diatribe by saying- the moment you hear of people that simply cannot afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number, it’s time to reconsider your exposure. 2018, I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio‘s hedge against inflation. I got push back - “what inflation?”. my rebuttal was and has always been that we don’t invest solely based on what’s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude. inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises. rates were near zero, and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same. right around the time silver crossed the $40 range, I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buying/investing in silver. it seemed to be all the rage. many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position. For them, it was fine. but for the rest of the bunch, the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal. To what end will you invest in silver? where are you hoping to see it? why suddenly now? Mind you, our monetary policy and debt expansion is not anywhere near the free-and-easy regime we saw between ‘18 and ‘21. But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own. They watch what others do, see the price run up, catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it’s ‘all systems go’. My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price. could silver move to $100/oz? surely. could also reach $1,000. my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves. if theres a case for $100, then there’s also a case for $50. the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong? what would that loss do to your time horizon? the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out. this is also costly. opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis. Having said all that, I love silver. It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time. But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom: your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio. Taxes on silver gains, unlike cap gains on stocks, are inescapable. The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure. How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS? and does 28% sound like a fun haircut to get? Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run. Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room. 3 if you’re weird. Point being, it takes more angles to house a decision.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ll summarize my diatribe by saying the moment you hear of people that simply can not afford to invest buying a particular asset and doing so in a large number it ’ s time to reconsider your exposure . 2018 I made silver recommendations as part of the portfolio ‘ s hedge against inflation . I got push back “ what inflation ” . my rebuttal was and has always been that we don ’ t invest solely based on what ’ s experienced but what we can reasonably conclude . inflation would show up somewhere just as surely as the sun rises . rates were near zero and I think a good lot of the crowd in here felt the same . right around the time silver crossed the $ 40 range I saw a spiked and sudden interest in buyinginvesting in silver . it seemed to be all the rage . many of my clients had the disposable cash to hold a position . For them it was fine . but for the rest of the bunch the conversation forced me to ask for a thesis and a goal . To what end will you invest in silver where are you hoping to see it why suddenly now Mind you our monetary policy and debt expansion is not_anywhere near the freeandeasy regime we saw between ‘ 18 and ‘ 21 . But the lay person rarely makes those comparative inferences on their own . They watch what others do see the price run up catch a few buzzword laden videos on YouTube and it ’ s ‘ all systems go ’ . My post here is an invitation to consider the demographics of people buying silver because their weak investment philosophy ends up being reflective in the price . could silver move to $ 100oz surely . could also reach $ 1000 . my ask of anyone is to see that there is some symmetry in how probabilities present themselves . if theres a case for $ 100 then there ’ s also a case for $ 50 . the question is what would it mean to you if your certainty is certainly wrong what would that loss do to your time horizon the new concept of stomaching loss is to extend the holding period and wait things out . this is also costly . opportunity cost should be part of your pricing analysis and investment thesis . Having said all that I love silver . It was the largest piece of the pie for me at one time . But God forbid you begin to do financially better and your income improves with wisdom your headwind becomes taxation and reinventing a scenario where silver makes sense in your portfolio . Taxes on silver gains unlike cap gains on stocks are inescapable . The reason that may matter more for some is because of the amount of relative exposure . How much of your wealth extracted from your portfolio do you want to be a check made payable to the IRS and does 28 % sound like a fun haircut to get Beware of the layperson taking the charge of a bull run . Understand it takes 4 corners to make a room . 3 if you ’ re weird . Point being it takes more angles to house a decision ."

      "title": "Portfolio Review - Sanity Check",
      "selftext": "Hello! 38 year old male here looking for a sanity check from the community before making changes to my portfolio. This is a taxable brokerage account at Fidelity, with a 20+ year horizon, aiming for long-term growth with enough stability to stay invested during downturns. My portfolio grew organically over time and now has significant overlap (multiple S&P 500 funds, total market funds, growth funds, etc.). I’m trying to simplify and be more intentional without materially changing my overall risk profile. (Roth IRA is handled separately.) Below is how my current allocation looks today. As you’ll see, there’s quite a bit of duplication across similar exposures. # Current Portfolio Allocation |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FXAIX|17.40%| |FDLXX|9.99%| |FSKAX|7.83%| |FZILX|5.95%| |SPY|5.90%| |VTI|5.47%| |VUG|5.44%| |FZROX|4.85%| |SOXX|4.61%| |FSELX|4.40%| |FTBFX|4.03%| |FSMDX|3.47%| |QQQ|3.44%| |FBGRX|3.20%| |VOO|3.05%| |FBALX|2.67%| |FCNTX|2.38%| |FSPTX|1.73%| |FPURX|1.57%| |FSPGX|1.19%| |FNILX|0.77%| |IAUM|0.43%| |FTIHX|0.23%| Option 1: ETF-based target allocation I’m leaning toward ETFs for simplicity, portability (in case I ever move away from Fidelity), and tax efficiency in a taxable account. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |VTI|25%| |VOO|25%| |VXUS|20%| |BND|10%| |VUG|8%| |SOXX|5%| |VO|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Option 2: Fidelity-native target allocation If I decide to stay fully within Fidelity, this would be the equivalent allocation using Fidelity funds. |Ticker|% of Account| |:-|:-| |FSKAX|25%| |FXAIX|25%| |FTIHX|20%| |FTBFX|10%| |FSPGX|8%| |FSELX|5%| |FSMDX|5%| |FDLXX|2%| Looking for feedback on - Does this allocation make sense for 38 / long-term taxable investing? Any obvious redundancies or unnecessary tilts? Would you simplify this further? Thoughts on VTI + VOO together vs a single US equity fund? Not trying to chase returns, mainly want something simple, diversified, and easy to stick with long term. Appreciate any input. Thanks!",

      "title": "Small cap value + momentum",
      "selftext": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term (50 years). I planned to just put money in the s&p500 monthly, but I learned about small cap value + momentum being theoretically more rewarding. This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean. Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that. This post is for people that find it interesting to look at, but any judgement/advice is also welcome of course. My strategy is the following: Average ROI of US SCV ETF + World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF + World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months. The higher one gets a weight of 70. This is the dynamic factor allocation (relative performance between the factors, cross-factor momentum). The ETF’s are: ZPRV on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF (Italian stock exchange) on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 (German stock exchange) on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF (English stock exchange) on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IE-domicile. Monthly contributions of €750 (at first, might increase when financial situation changes) with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 70/30 or 30/70 between the factors (SCV and momentum). Realistically between 20-40 and 60-80 is fine. Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 50/50, but +-10 difference is fine. Yearly rebalancing on fixed date (my birthday) if necessary. When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high, I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay. EDIT: based in Europe.",

      "selftext_processed": "As a beginning investor I am looking for ways to built wealth for the extremely long term 50 years . I planned to just put money in the sp500 monthly but I learned about small cap value momentum being theoretically more rewarding . This lead me into a rabbit hole of finding academically proven strategies to increase the geometric mean . Based on what I learned I decided on a very disciplined approach that tries to do just that . This post is for people that find it interesting to look at but any judgementadvice is also welcome of course . My strategy is the following Average ROI of US SCV ETF World SCV ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months gets compared to average ROI of US momentum ETF World momentum ETF on time period of 12 – 1 months . The higher one gets a weight of 70 . This is the dynamic factor allocation relative performance between the factors crossfactor momentum . The ETF ’ s are ZPRV on IBIS 2 German stock exchange on IBKR IWMO on BVME.ETF Italian stock exchange on IBKR ZPRX on IBIS 2 German stock exchange on IBKR IUMO on LSEETF English stock exchange on IBKR All 4 accumulating and IEdomicile . Monthly contributions of €750 at first might increase when financial situation changes with cashflow rebalancing to get as close as possible to an allocation of 7030 or 3070 between the factors SCV and momentum . Realistically between 2040 and 6080 is fine . Within the factors the allocation should stay close to 5050 but 10 difference is fine . Yearly rebalancing on fixed date my birthday if necessary . When monthly contributions and total portfolio become significantly high I will start thinking about adding light leverage and a trend overlay . EDIT based in Europe ."

      "selftext": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of micron's memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful. The stock was around 80$. So I picked it up. Sold it after some 20% gains. Did it twice or 3 times. However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not profitable. I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20% gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the (10% annual gain is good) rule. However in the crazy AI era, the bubble vs not bubble is not like any other. The conservative investor should not follow the trends. In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure. However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio. It should be away from tech. As I do not believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices. Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers' stocks. The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron. However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not be justified as there is no race anymore. I think of AI like the space race between superpowers. The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not equal or at least would not be growing (i.e. the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20% or 50% but very small probability that I do not care of). I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000$ from a weighted average of 2000$ scattered on 2.5 years. I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years. I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400$ sold it for 600$ then bought 800$ and sold 1000$. I can not stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else. Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains. So I'll start following the 80% 20% rule, 20 for the trading, 80 for long term investing. What good industries that set for continued growth in next 5-10 years, not financial institutions or consumer like Walmart. I aim for products or services that will improve people lives. I'll then start to look for some innovative companies either in its service/product or its way of doing them in better financial way. This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for people's advice here.",

      "selftext_processed": "I was working on a memory task in my software work and liked the datasheet of microns memory as it was very organized and the chip is powerful . The stock was around 80 $ . So I picked it up . Sold it after some 20 % gains . Did it twice or 3 times . However I withdrew around 3 months ago and the last withdrawal was not_profitable . I started investing mid 2022 and set a plan for long term but the 20 % gains always pushes me to sell and call it a good year following the 10 % annual gain is good rule . However in the crazy AI era the bubble vs not_bubble is not_like any other . The conservative investor should not_follow the trends . In short AI made my principles fail and it is my problem for sure . However to recover my mentality and my resilience I need to create a new portfolio . It should be away from tech . As I do not_believe AI will enhance our day to day activities and if it did the value of stocks already took this future value inside its prices . Especially when I hear all companies are buying eachothers stocks . The only valid stock for me in tech is Micron . However it is also cyclical driven when the AI data centers building phase ends the RAM prices would not_be justified as there is no_race anymore . I think of AI like the space race between superpowers . The value of stock is heavily impacted by politics and greed which both always hype the prices however the gains are not_equal or at least would not_be growing i.e . the risk is very high vs the reward is max another 20 % or 50 % but very small probability that I do not_care of . I am 30 years old now and earned around 1000 $ from a weighted average of 2000 $ scattered on 2.5 years . I say that is a good start in general but absolutely not_good compared to the AI gains in the last 2.5 years . I did same mistake of Micron with Nvidia too I started when it was 400 $ sold it for 600 $ then bought 800 $ and sold 1000 $ . I can not_stick for a crazy stock for long as I like to grab the gains and then look somewhere else . Yet timing the market long term surely will wipe my gains . So Ill start following the 80 % 20 % rule 20 for the trading 80 for long term investing . What good industries that set for continued growth in next 510 years not_financial institutions or consumer like Walmart . I aim for products or services that will improve people lives . Ill then start to look for some innovative companies either in its serviceproduct or its way of doing them in better financial way . This is my first post here and I am really looking forward for peoples advice here ."

      "selftext": "Valens looks like extreme mispricing at $2.5. There was a -$82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners, likely from ticker collision between $VLN and $VLN Toronto. Because of this, algorithms modeled this company to have <1Y runway after spending $82 Million while in reality they still have $93M cash and $11m in inventory. Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday. Yet algorithms have not caught on yet, as they're still modeling negative EV from -$82M burn (this requires manual correction). Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to -$82M error on Stonegate, Streetwise, and scanners. $VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $255M market cap size. This is not due to company quality and it's definitely not some random micro stock. But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in <1Y runway from $82m burn. This is a extremely mispriced AI & Robotics fabless chipmaker with: \\- Mercedes \\- Samsung \\- Mobileye (EyeQ6) \\- Siemens \\- Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers. $VLN has \\- Zero Debt. \\- $93.5 Million Cash \\- $11 Million + in inventory. \\- \\~$80M+ est. forward revenue \\- 69.1% gross margins on their robotics/machine vision/industrial vertical (growing 40% Y/Y). Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0%. If you want to compare similar companies: \\- Lattice $LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EV/Revenue. \\- Macom $MTSI, trades around 13x and 16.5x. EV/Revenue. Valens trades at: 2.4x. Which looks like a glitch. Even non-premium, 20-30% gross margin, companies trade at 4-5x (more than double current prices). We now see an extreme mispricing of a $NVDA-margin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors. Even trading at a normal 10x EV/revenue (no premium) would be $893.5M/106.34M= \\-> $8.40 from $2.5. This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision.",

There was a $ 82M inventory burn data error used by algorithms and scanners likely from ticker collision between $ VLN and $ VLN Toronto . Because of this algorithms modeled this company to have 1Y runway after spending $ 82 Million while in reality they still have $ 93M cash and $ 11m in inventory . Retail has found out about the ticker collision yesterday . Yet algorithms have not_caught on yet as theyre still modeling negative EV from $ 82M burn this requires manual correction . Everyone is encouraged to fact check everything below from financials posted to $ 82M error on Stonegate Streetwise and scanners . $ VLN is heavily misunderstood due to its $ 255M market cap size . This is not_due to company quality and its definitely not_some random micro stock . But an artificial suppression from algorithmic pricing in 1Y runway from $ 82m burn . This is a extremely mispriced AI Robotics fabless chipmaker with Mercedes Samsung Mobileye EyeQ6 Siemens Logitch and many other leading OEMs and Robotics companies as customers . $ VLN has Zero Debt . $ 93.5 Million Cash $ 11 Million in inventory . $ 80M est . forward revenue 69.1 % gross margins on their roboticsmachine visionindustrial vertical growing 40 % YY . Blended margins from their automotive segment brings it down to 63.0 % . If you want to compare similar companies Lattice $ LSCC trades around 19x and 23x EVRevenue . Macom $ MTSI trades around 13x and 16.5x . EVRevenue . Valens trades at 2.4x . Which looks like a glitch . Even nonpremium 2030 % gross margin companies trade at 45x more than double current prices . We now see an extreme mispricing of a $ NVDAmargin fabless chipmaker in verticals for machine vision in robotics to AI automotive sectors . Even trading at a normal 10x EVrevenue no premium would be $ 893.5M106.34M $ 8.40 from $ 2.5 . This seems like an algorithmic mispricing of a decade from NYSE and Toronto ticker collision ."

I read some Motley Fool articles and picks, I look at the charts and graphs and 1-year target price info on Yahoo Finance, and I was thinking of getting a Zack's Investment Research subscription to get their list of #1 Strong Buy stocks (They say their #1 buy stock picks have returned about 25% per year since 1988 or something...Maybe that is skewed by a few really big winners and the others are flat. I don't know...) With however many thousands of stocks there are, I would like someone else to do most of the heavy listing and analysis for me, winnowing out the lower quality stocks with less potential, so I can make a more informed, educated selection (guess? gamble?). So what resource do you think provides the best, most accurate, time-tested analysis that you would trust to help you make purchasing decissions?",

What resources do you use to help you pick stocks I read some Motley Fool articles and picks I look at the charts and graphs and 1year target price info on Yahoo Finance and I was thinking of getting a Zacks Investment Research subscription to get their list of 1 Strong Buy stocks They say their 1 buy stock picks have returned about 25 % per year since 1988 or something ... Maybe that is skewed by a few really big winners and the others are flat . I dont know ... With however many thousands of stocks there are I would like someone else to do most of the heavy listing and analysis for me winnowing out the lower quality stocks with less potential so I can make a more informed educated selection guess gamble . So what resource do you think provides the best most accurate timetested analysis that you would trust to help you make purchasing decissions"

      "selftext_processed": "Source TSMC the worlds largest contract chipmaker on Friday reported a 20.45 % increase in ​fourthquarter revenue from a year earlier beating the ‌market forecast as demand for the companys products leapt in response to ‌surging interest in AI applications . The company whose customers include Nvidia and Apple has been a major beneficiary of advances in AI which has more than offset the tapering off of ⁠pandemicled demand for chips ‌used in consumer electronics like tablets . Revenue for the OctoberDecember period was T $ 1.046 trillion $ 33.11 billion according ‍to Reuters calculations based on monthly data released by the company compared with T $ 868.46 billion in the yearago period . The latest result beat a ​LSEG SmartEstimate of T $ 1.036 trillion $ 32.79 billion drawn from 20 analysts ‌and was in line with guidance of $ 32.2 billion to $ 33.4 billion issued by TSMC in October in its last earnings call . TSMC only gives guidance in U.S. dollars . TSMC will report full fourthquarter earnings on January 15 when it is expected ⁠to provide updated guidance for the ​current quarter and full year ​including its capital expenditure plans and revenue growth outlook . TSMCs Taipeilisted shares gained 44.2 % last year outperforming the ‍25.7 % rise ⁠for the broader market . Taiwans Foxconn the worlds largest contract electronics maker and Nvidias biggest server maker also reported ⁠bumper sales on Monday logging T $ 2.6028 trillion $ 82.20 billion for the fourth quarter ."

      "selftext": "Over the past couple of years, I started learning about investment and securities. Before then, I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never be able to understand. However, the deeper I go, the more angry and disillusioned I feel. What started as “invest in a company you believe in and grow with it” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement, no matter the method, no matter the ethics. It’s no longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow, it’s about speed, leverage, arbitrage, and squeezing edge out of anything that moves. Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself. Not from creating value. Not from improving products. Just from being faster, more aggressive, more optimised than the next guy. And it’s not just traditional markets. Look at crypto. In theory it was meant to democratise finance. In practice it’s become a playground for: - Rug pulls - Pump-and-dumps - Influencer scams - Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not to build, but to extract. The goal isn’t “grow something useful.” It’s “how do I get mine before everyone else does?” What bothers me most isn’t that some people are greedy, that’s human. It’s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage. If you hesitate, someone else front-runs you. If you care, someone else exploits the gap. At some point, it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose. I know markets are necessary. Capital has to flow. Risk has to be priced. But it feels like we’ve built a hyper-financialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it. And it leaves you wondering: Is this really what “investing” is supposed to be?",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past couple of years I started learning about investment and securities . Before then I saw everything related to this space as a black box that I would never_be able to understand . However the deeper I go the more angry and disillusioned I feel . What started as “ invest in a company you believe in and grow with it ” has turned into a system obsessed with extracting every possible dollar from price movement no_matter the method no_matter the ethics . It ’ s no_longer about funding innovation or helping businesses grow it ’ s about speed leverage arbitrage and squeezing edge out of anything that moves . Entire careers now exist just to profit from volatility itself . Not_from creating value . Not_from improving products . Just from being faster more aggressive more optimised than the next guy . And it ’ s not_just traditional markets . Look at crypto . In theory it was meant to democratise finance . In practice it ’ s become a playground for Rug pulls Pumpanddumps Influencer scams Projects designed from day one to siphon liquidity and disappear So many people now enter markets not_to build but to extract . The goal isn ’ t “ grow something useful. ” It ’ s “ how do I get mine before everyone else does ” What bothers me most isn ’ t that some people are greedy that ’ s human . It ’ s that the system rewards greed so efficiently that moral restraint becomes a disadvantage . If you hesitate someone else frontruns you . If you care someone else exploits the gap . At some point it stops feeling like an engine of progress and starts feeling like an arms race of optimisation divorced from any social purpose . I know markets are necessary . Capital has to flow . Risk has to be priced . But it feels like we ’ ve built a hyperfinancialised layer on top of reality whose only product is more money for those already inside it . And it leaves you wondering Is this really what “ investing ” is supposed to be"

I don't know why I keep shooting myself in the dick but fuck it, its only a loss when I sell or something pithy like that right? To make it even better, I'm trading this on Etoro itself. I mean I like the platform, why wouldn't I like the stock? Its just like robinhood right (turns out no) AND I am whats called on there a \"popular investor\" which basically means all the noobs who \"know they should invest in something but don't know how to start\" can just \"copy\" me, and they execute all the same trades as me. I have hundreds of people who copy my trades, so I have no idea how much money I have lost people. One of my copiers was clearly a family investing their joint money, they closed their copy down 25% in total after copying me for like 6 months. So while all of you can claim to be dipshits, I'm the dipshit losing both mine AND strangers money.",

I already got rejected from the research track and I’m waiting until April for the applied track results, but I’m worried I’m \"too old\" at 30 compared to the 20-year-olds with no experience they seem to prefer. The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold, and I’m still salty after losing 70% (due to currency devaluation) of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa. Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating, but I’m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k (around 18k USD, so 30% of my holdings at current prices) if I finally get the green light.",

Currently I have all my money in VOO and cash in IBKR around 60k USD in total Im moving it to either SPYL or VUAA I also want to diversify Im worried about how heavy nvidia is about USA current geopolitical actions also I dont really like how heavy financial sector is in all ETFs . this is what Im thinking I MIGHT need some parts of it in a few months if not_Im moving them to SPYL.L because I dont see USA falling anytime soon with their navy and them being the largest consumer of the world so if something happens to them it will happen to all of the world . Also currently no_income but in the future Id probably do at least 50 % SP500 then rest is depends on how the market is could be more sp500 .

I already got rejected from the research track and I ’ m waiting until April for the applied track results but I ’ m worried I ’ m too old at 30 compared to the 20yearolds with no_experience they seem to prefer . The opportunity cost is killing me I originally planned to buy gold and I ’ m still salty after losing 70 % due to currency devaluation of my EGP savings in 2021 waiting on a Canadian visa . Watching inexperienced kids get accepted over me is frustrating but I ’ m hoping my stock portfolio is diversified enough to cover the €15k around 18k USD so 30 % of my holdings at current prices if I finally get the green light ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! I am 22 years old and have been wanting to start investing for more than a year now. I have spent all this time researching it, and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026, until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it. So, I am posting to ask for opinions, to make sure I am thinking the right way, or to highlight any wrongdoings. I live in Europe; my currency is the euro. I have about €20k in savings, and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing, I'm on the last year of university, don't have a job and still live with my parents (altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university). The goal is to invest for 30-40 years. I read a lot about an all world ETF, but i just don't think i want to do it. I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market, rather than sicking with just one and having no idea why it goes up or down (if that makes sense). My plan was to do 60% S&P500, 30% Stoxx 600 and 10% Emerging Markets. It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe. But now i just feel like i'm \"replicating\" all world ETF, and started to think i should just buy that, even though i don't want to for the reasons i stated before. Is my plan good? Should i add or remove anything? Change the percenteges? I'm just looking for some guidance and/or reassurance. Thanks to everyone in advance!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone I am 22 years old and have been wanting to start investing for more than a year now . I have spent all this time researching it and I finally decided to start at the beginning of 2026 until the time to start came and all of a sudden I felt very insecure about doing it . So I am posting to ask for opinions to make sure I am thinking the right way or to highlight any wrongdoings . I live in Europe my currency is the euro . I have about €20k in savings and about 3k i would be confortable to start investing Im on the last year of university dont have a job and still live with my parents altough i plan to get a job and move out once i finish university . The goal is to invest for 3040 years . I read a lot about an all world ETF but i just dont think i want to do it . I think spreading the money across multiple ETF would be better to help me learn and understand the market rather than sicking with just one and having no_idea why it goes up or down if that makes sense . My plan was to do 60 % SP500 30 % Stoxx 600 and 10 % Emerging Markets . It felt right because it seems diversified and somewhat safe . But now i just feel like im replicating all world ETF and started to think i should just buy that even though i dont want to for the reasons i stated before . Is my plan good Should i add or remove anything Change the percenteges Im just looking for some guidance andor reassurance . Thanks to everyone in advance"

      "selftext": "Vanguard's VOO seems to be the default ETF 'hold' and with good reason: it's performance has been exceptionally solid. But, when you look at Blackrock's Australian-founded, internationally-invested ETF IWLD, its upside in every respect seems to be far superior (except for management fees, which are more than offset by total cumulative returns. IWLD has generally tracked VOO very closely. Here are the differences: * Over 5 years, IWLD has, excluding dividends, returned 12.8% (higher), while VOO has returned \\~12.6% (lower) * Over 5 years, IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20% - 1.21% (higher), while VOO has paid 1.10% - 1.20% (lower) * IWLD is ESG screened, so it cuts out the most harmful stocks, while VOO has no screening other than the S&P (it hold's Chevron (fossil fuels) Phillip Morris (tobacco) etc. * VOO's fees are lower (0.03) vs IWLD's (0.2) * IWLD is more diversified, with more mid-sized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US, while VOO is very US, large-cap and tech-stock-heavy * IWLD is less US currency exposed, whereas IWLD (being internationally invested and Australian-based) has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very, very unstable When you look at the two ETFs, IWLD has grown more, returns more in dividends, costs more in fees, is more sustainable, is more diversified and is less currency exposed. On almost every metric, and in aggregate, it is a better fund. Why don't we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets?",

But when you look at Blackrocks Australianfounded internationallyinvested ETF IWLD its upside in every respect seems to be far superior except for management fees which are more than offset by total cumulative returns . IWLD has generally tracked VOO very closely . Here are the differences Over 5 years IWLD has excluding dividends returned 12.8 % higher while VOO has returned 12.6 % lower Over 5 years IWLD has paid annual dividends of 1.20 % 1.21 % higher while VOO has paid 1.10 % 1.20 % lower IWLD is ESG screened so it cuts out the most harmful stocks while VOO has no_screening other than the SP it holds Chevron fossil fuels Phillip Morris tobacco etc . VOOs fees are lower 0.03 vs IWLDs 0.2 IWLD is more diversified with more midsized market caps and an international focus well beyond the US while VOO is very US largecap and techstockheavy IWLD is less US currency exposed whereas IWLD being internationally invested and Australianbased has a lower currency exposure to a country whose fiscal policy agenda is now very very unstable When you look at the two ETFs IWLD has grown more returns more in dividends costs more in fees is more sustainable is more diversified and is less currency exposed . On almost every metric and in aggregate it is a better fund . Why dont we see IWLD being promoted more for those whose brokers allow play in international markets"

First trade was PAA calls, got bored on Monday and sold them for a small gain. Trade 2 was a ticker that cannot be named here. Saw volume increasing and though it could pop and decided to YOLO some short date options (broke my rule that options have to be at least a month or two out, but rules are meant to be broken). Got impatient today and sold them for a $10k loss. THEN things got interesting. Was mad so I bought some 0DTE INTC and ORCL calls today and spun about $40k into $75k (that was dumb, never again). Which brings me to LULU. They got hammered today because the Supreme Court tariff decision is delayed (we knew that would happen). LULU is already navigating a tariff world and doing just fine (see last earnings report). It’s in a clear uptrend since November and this thing will bounce. Feeling frisky so bought some calls that expire next week but majority in April 2026 calls with an earnings report before then. All $200 strike (no regarded OTMs). Got lucky with some dumb trades but going to be better. Too much trading in too short of time. Next stop $100k with goal of $500k by year end.",

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets. DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what’s broken so it can get fixed fast. AI is fueling their growth big time. Not just by automating internal stuff, but by driving revenue. They have 500 AI-native clients already, and over 5,000 out of their 32,000 customers are using DataDog’s AI tools to track generative AI applications. That’s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users. As more companies jump on AI, DataDog becomes even more critical. Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly. All my engineer friends at work swear by it. No contest, leader in observability. Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up, almost no marketing spend, and retention is insane. I’m holding $DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term. Holding 6455 shares at $129.99 this is not financial advice just my opinion",

Think about every time you buy clothes online or grab concert tickets . DataDog is the one flagging slow pages and showing exactly what ’ s broken so it can get fixed fast . AI is fueling their growth big time . Not_just by automating internal stuff but by driving revenue . They have 500 AInative clients already and over 5000 out of their 32000 customers are using DataDog ’ s AI tools to track generative AI applications . That ’ s a huge opportunity to sell more AI solutions to their existing users . As more companies jump on AI DataDog becomes even more critical . Everyone needs their integrations to keep apps running smoothly . All my engineer friends at work swear by it . No_contest leader in observability . Their revenue keeps climbing like a straight line up almost no_marketing spend and retention is insane . I ’ m holding $ DDOG and I honestly think this thing could make a lot of people rich long term . Holding 6455 shares at $ 129.99 this is not_financial advice just my opinion"

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

      "selftext_processed": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation . The company is executing a rollup strategy in building products distribution an extremely large fragmented and underdigitized industry . The investment case is less about shortterm housing cycles and more about disciplined MA operational improvement and longterm compounding . QXO operates in building materials distribution with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products . It supplies contractors with products such as shingles insulation siding waterproofing and related materials . Key characteristics of the industry $ 800B total addressable market Highly fragmented dominated by regional operators Low digital penetration Logisticsintensive and relationshipdriven Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital systems and operational discipline . The core of the thesis is management . Brad Jacobs has built multiple largescale industrial platforms United Waste sold for $ 2.5B United Rentals URI became the largest equipment rental company globally XPO Logistics 30x return later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses Jacobs followed a consistent playbook 1 . Enter fragmented industries 2 . Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3 . Standardize operations 4 . Invest heavily in technology 5 . Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."
