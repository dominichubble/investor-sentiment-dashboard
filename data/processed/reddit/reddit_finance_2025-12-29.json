      "selftext": "So ever since \"Liberation Day\" there have been countless deals that have been made with President Trump to heavily invest in the US. Dozens of countries have promised to throw hundreds of billions of dollars into the US. Almost every single tech company has promised some kid of major investment. Many of these deals were made several months ago so I would think now would be an appropriate time to check for any significant updates. However, after doing some digging, all I can find are data centers being built around the US for AI. Stargate, for example, a $500B deal announced in January 2025 has just gotten approval from Michigan to build a data center. From my limited understanding, while AI is huge, in terms of manufacturing it is quite minimal as it is basically just allowing models to train on stored data, and once built, these centers basically just become massive servers that aren't continuously producing goods. I can find nothing on all the promised investments from the EU, Canada, Mexico, and several Asian countries in US manufacturing. Curious if other people have better info on what this \"manufacturing boom\" that Trump has promised will look like in 2026. I know this is quite a naive, and somewhat overly optimistic question to ask, but we did see an uptick in GDP due to increased exports and so while 80 to even 90% of all these \"deals might be BS, even 5% of it being legit would be quite a significant amount being invested if we are taking the numbers thrown around at face value.",

      "selftext": "Some more stock ideas from the latest issue of Barron’s Magazine. **CRM** Salesforce is highlighted as this week’s stock pick. Salesforce had a bad 2025 and is down more than 20%, but Barron’s thinks this is a bad reaction to the impact of AI on Salesforce’s business. Salesforce may prove to be one of the winners in the AI game with its AgentForce services that are gaining traction with customers. And in the meantime Salesforce’s current services are going gangbusters and both revenue and margins are growing. Profit margins have more than doubled over the last few years. **RDDT** Reddit is growing faster than most social media and customer engagement is double that of its peers. AI is also a tailwind for Reddit’s licensing and ad revenue. Earnings per share are growing by 60-100% this year so analysts from Needham, Truist and Citi are choosing RDDT as a top pick for 2026. **NKE** Nike got two mentions in this week’s magazine. First Barron’s noted Tim Cook’s big $3M open market insider buy of NKE stock as a sign of confidence in a turnaround. And second Nike was also noted as a possible beneficiary of a potential $2000 check being paid out of the OBBBA as a tariff rebate to taxpayers this year. Barron’s posits that retail stocks like Nike stand to benefit the most from this kind of stimulus.",

      "title": "moomoo Review: Is it actually better than the alternatives? (Honest thoughts after 5 months)",
      "selftext": "I opened and funded my moomoo account about three months ago because I was finally done with my previous broker. To be blunt, I came from Robinhood. I’ve wanted to leave ever since the GME fiasco where they turned off the buy button, but I honestly just got lazy and dragged my feet for years. Recently, I decided to finally pull the trigger and move to a platform that prioritizes stability over gamification. Here is my honest breakdown after using moomoo daily: Pros: * Market Data: The free Level 2 data is a game-changer. Unlike my old app where I had to pay extra or just guess, seeing the order book depth here helps a lot. * Trading Hours: The access to full pre-market (4 AM ET) is excellent. I like being able to react to news before the standard market opens. * charts: The charting is intense. I honestly only use VWAP and RSI, but it’s nice to have a million other indicators available if I ever get smart enough to use them. Cons: * The UI is... A Lot: It’s super cluttered. Information overload is real. Has anyone else finally made the switch to moomoo recently? For those of you who have been using moomoo for a while, what are your thoughts on the platform? Did you find the transition difficult, or did the better tools make it worth the effort?",

I ’ ve wanted to leave ever since the GME fiasco where they turned off the buy button but I honestly just got lazy and dragged my feet for years . Recently I decided to finally pull the trigger and move to a platform that prioritizes stability over gamification . Here is my honest breakdown after using moomoo daily Pros Market Data The free Level 2 data is a gamechanger . Unlike my old app where I had to pay extra or just guess seeing the order book depth here helps a lot . Trading Hours The access to full premarket 4 AM ET is excellent . I like being able to react to news before the standard market opens . charts The charting is intense . I honestly only use VWAP and RSI but it ’ s nice to have a million other indicators available if I ever get smart enough to use them . Cons The UI is ... A Lot It ’ s super cluttered . Information overload is real . Has anyone else finally made the switch to moomoo recently For those of you who have been using moomoo for a while what are your thoughts on the platform Did you find the transition difficult or did the better tools make it worth the effort"

If you buy the stock today at $8.44 and thereafter immediately sell a covered call for $15 strike expiring in Jan 2028, you get a credit of $4.35 per stock. This gives you downside protection upto 50% in terms of stock decline while limiting your upside to 77%. Best case is you make a return of 77.77% plus $4.35 per stock due to the covered call and worst case is you buy back the covered call (which would be significantly reduced in value) when the stock drops by 40% and write another covered call for a lower strike price to cover more downside. This all can be done due to the high IV of the stock. This literally can’t go t*ts up. PS: This isn’t financial advice but just musings of a guy in a 7/11 parking lot.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I turned 18 in April. I have a long time horizon (40+ years), and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction. I’m trying to be intentional about account placement, taxes, and risk. Before anyone says anything, I’ve maxed my Roth IRA already, and plan to keep on doing so. I also had roughly 2k in my taxable. **Roth IRA (growth focused):** **• 65% VOO** **• 35% QQQM** My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I’m young. **Taxable account:** **• 60% equal weighted sector growth stocks** **• 30% AVUV (US small cap value)** **• 10% SPYI** The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated. It is approximately 55% technology, 20% healthcare, 10% financials, 5% consumer discretionary, 5% consumer staples, and 5% crypto via a thematic ETF. The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term. This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions, especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds. AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods. SPYI is intentionally kept small. The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow, while reinvesting all distributions for now. I am not trying to market time or trade frequently. This is meant to be a long term, mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing. **Curious to hear thoughts on:** **• Asset location choices** **• The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure** **• Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient** Thanks in advance for any feedback.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I turned 18 in April . I have a long time horizon 40 years and would appreciate some feedback on my portfolio construction . I ’ m trying to be intentional about account placement taxes and risk . Before anyone says anything I ’ ve maxed my Roth IRA already and plan to keep on doing so . I also had roughly 2k in my taxable . Roth IRA growth focused • 65 % VOO • 35 % QQQM My thinking here is to maximize long term tax free growth and lean into equities while I ’ m young . Taxable account • 60 % equal weighted sector growth stocks • 30 % AVUV US small cap value • 10 % SPYI The sector growth basket is equal weighted across 20 holdings and is intentionally concentrated . It is approximately 55 % technology 20 % healthcare 10 % financials 5 % consumer discretionary 5 % consumer staples and 5 % crypto via a thematic ETF . The goal is to seek some alpha in taxable while keeping positions tax efficient and long term . This is also the part of the portfolio where I expect most people to have opinions especially around the tech concentration and the decision to hold individual stocks instead of only broad index funds . AVUV is included to diversify away from mega cap growth and to capture the small cap value premium over long periods . SPYI is intentionally kept small . The idea is to slowly build an income producing position in taxable over decades so that later in life it can provide meaningful cash flow while reinvesting all distributions for now . I am not_trying to market time or trade frequently . This is meant to be a long term mostly hands off strategy with occasional rebalancing . Curious to hear thoughts on • Asset location choices • The role of AVUV alongside growth heavy exposure • Whether starting a small income position this early makes sense or is inefficient Thanks in advance for any feedback ."

      "selftext": "I’ve seen a lot of information and talking points supporting either side. It’s a complicated question that has to consider a lot variables. Market returns, interests rates, tax implications, housing markets, stock trends, the economy etc. should all be considered. I have a 6.8% interest rate and owe $238k left on my home. I did the math and if I pay an additional $5000 a month, I will have my home paid off by February 2030 or in 4 years. 25 years early and would save $235k+ in interest. Very enticing. I usually invest roughly $5000 into the market a month so this is all possible with my income. I already have a $200k diversified portfolio (well over 1000 shares of ASTS included) So I’m considering letting that sit for least 3 years and either throwing $5000 at VOO or a similar etf and waiting till it hits $238k and sell to payoff the mortgage or just paying the additional $5000 right into my mortgage and handling that separately. There’s no growth but it’s a guaranteed return. any thoughts or considerations are appreciated. I just want to be debt free and happy by 2030… just not quite sure the best route to get there. 35 years old $180k year salary in a recession resistant career Own a rental property on the side (owe $180k at 3%, fully supported by long time tenants with a modest monthly profit)",

I ’ m just gon na pick some stocks crypto that I think have potential and just hold . This is all without using options as well lmao"

One thing to note about the timing of the event is that it comes just two months after Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada Jan 5-9 2026. Whatever consumer-facing products NVIDIA has in store (could we finally get a GeForce RTX 50 Super series announcement?) are likely to be detailed on around CES. At GTC in March, the focus will be on the \"next wave of AI innovation.\" \"NVIDIA GTC is the premier global AI conference, where developers, researchers, and business leaders come together to explore the next wave of AI innovation. From physical AI and AI factories to agentic AI and inference, GTC 2026 will showcase the breakthroughs shaping every industry,\" NVIDIA states on its GTC page. For context, NVIDIA laid out its two-year AI roadmap at its GTC event in March of this year with Vera Rubin NVL144 planned for the second half of 2026 and Rubin Ultra NVL576 on track to launch in 2027. NVIDIA also unveiled its its Blackwell RTX Pro to turbocharge AI workstations, servers, and laptops, and trotted out its Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPU with 288GB of HBM3e memory on a single package. The latter solution paves the way for 20TB of HBM3e on a rack of Blackwell Ultra GB300 aa (such as NVIDIA's GB300 NVL72) and a monstrous 1.1 exaFLOPS of FP4 compute. Do you think there will be any big announcements made at GTC 2026?",

Each sale I've made was for a reason and not always the right one. I sold KTOS because the stock was sliding to my purchase price before earnings and I had a small position. It popped afterwards. I recently bought back in after another dip so it worked out. I just checked on Carpenter Technologies, one of my first stocks, and it's at $324.25 shit ! I sold because tariffs were dragging it down and I figured growth would flatten out. Big mistake. I'm seeing an entry point for ATI to get back into manufactured metals for turbines, rockets, satellites, medical devices and defense. Point being it was one of my first stocks and I had total confidence in the company and I let emotions and some volitiliy make the decision to sell for me.",

Each sale Ive made was for a reason and not_always the right one . I sold KTOS because the stock was sliding to my purchase price before earnings and I had a small position . It popped afterwards . I recently bought back in after another dip so it worked out . I just checked on Carpenter Technologies one of my first stocks and its at $ 324.25 shit I sold because tariffs were dragging it down and I figured growth would flatten out . Big mistake . Im seeing an entry point for ATI to get back into manufactured metals for turbines rockets satellites medical devices and defense . Point being it was one of my first stocks and I had total confidence in the company and I let emotions and some volitiliy make the decision to sell for me ."

Long-term horizon (5–10 years), not trading.

      "selftext": "Silver has surged so much that one ounce of silver now costs more than a barrel of crude oil, which is historically unusual. This isn’t happening just because oil is cheap; it’s mainly because silver demand has exploded. Global silver production has failed to keep pace with demand, creating severe supply tightness. Most silver is mined as a by-product of other metals, so even at higher prices, supply cannot be increased quickly or easily. At the same time, industrial demand for silver is extremely strong. The metal is heavily used in solar panels, electric vehicles, electronics, batteries, and AI-related technology. Industrial users are now competing directly with investors for physical silver, further tightening the market. Investment demand has also surged. Many investors are moving into silver as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement, while others see it as a leveraged play on gold. Increased buying through ETFs and futures markets has reduced the amount of available silver even further.",

      "selftext": "I want some honest advice on holding this portfolio for 20+ years. My thesis is basically that these larger tech companies will consume their unfair share of value creation over the next decade, especially as AI, Robotics and Space become more established industries. I also think they are safe long term individual holds as I cant see these companies going out of business (even just considering their balance sheets). I can’t convince myself that international or small/mid caps will outperform the top 500 companies in the US long term with what I think is coming from a technology perspective. I know there is risk to this portfolio and I am not that concerned about drawdowns as I should have the income to sustain my lifestyle. My hope is that long term holding of this portfolio will set me up very well into retirement and give me incredible assets to pass down to my future generations. I don’t really have anyone to stress test this thesis with in an educated way so I wanted to post here and see what others think about this. It's worth mentioning that a lot of these holdings are very much \"in the green\" from a cost basis perspective. My plan over the foreseeable future is to continue putting money into retirement accounts up to the max, allocate \\~100K or so towards S&P500 exposure in my investment account per year for as long as I can, and then allocate another 20K investment towards SpaceX when they IPO. I want to let the individual holdings sit for a long time before considering rebalancing or trimming. What am I missing or what do I have wrong? Do I have too much recency bias in my holdings if I intend for them to be long term assets? When I am 50 will this turn me into a multi millionaire or leave me wishing I had more diversity? |Account|**Balance**|**Portfolio** **Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |Robinhood (Tech Stocks + S&P 500)|$328,149|50.13%| |Crypto (Bitcoin)|$133,507|20.40%| |401K (S&P 500)|$120,031|18.34%| |IRA (S&P 500)|$36,496|5.58%| |Roth IRA (S&P 500)|$27,935|4.27%| |HSA (S&P 500)|$7,299|1.12%| |Roth 401K (S&P 500)|$1,161|0.18%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**| |Holding|**Total Balance**|**Portfolio Weight**| |:-|:-|:-| |S&P 500|$257,091|39.28%| |Bitcoin|$133,507|20.40%| |Tesla|$44,763|6.84%| |Alphabet|$37,954|5.80%| |Cash|$37,007|5.65%| |NVIDIA|$35,868|5.48%| |Amazon|$24,445|3.73%| |Apple|$23,136|3.53%| |Microsoft|$22,974|3.51%| |Meta|$19,023|2.91%| |TSMC|$18,811|2.87%| |**Total**|**$654,579**|**100.00%**|",

      "selftext_processed": "I want some honest advice on holding this portfolio for 20 years . My thesis is basically that these larger tech companies will consume their unfair share of value creation over the next decade especially as AI Robotics and Space become more established industries . I also think they are safe long term individual holds as I cant see these companies going out of business even just considering their balance sheets . I can ’ t convince myself that international or smallmid caps will outperform the top 500 companies in the US long term with what I think is coming from a technology perspective . I know there is risk to this portfolio and I am not_that concerned about drawdowns as I should have the income to sustain my lifestyle . My hope is that long term holding of this portfolio will set me up very well into retirement and give me incredible assets to pass down to my future generations . I don ’ t really have anyone to stress test this thesis with in an educated way so I wanted to post here and see what others think about this . Its worth mentioning that a lot of these holdings are very much in the green from a cost basis perspective . My plan over the foreseeable future is to continue putting money into retirement accounts up to the max allocate 100K or so towards SP500 exposure in my investment account per year for as long as I can and then allocate another 20K investment towards SpaceX when they IPO . I want to let the individual holdings sit for a long time before considering rebalancing or trimming . What am I missing or what do I have wrong Do I have too much recency bias in my holdings if I intend for them to be long term assets When I am 50 will this turn me into a multi millionaire or leave me wishing I had more diversity AccountBalancePortfolio Weight Robinhood Tech Stocks SP 500 $ 32814950.13 % Crypto Bitcoin $ 13350720.40 % 401K SP 500 $ 12003118.34 % IRA SP 500 $ 364965.58 % Roth IRA SP 500 $ 279354.27 % HSA SP 500 $ 72991.12 % Roth 401K SP 500 $ 11610.18 % Total $ 654579100.00 % HoldingTotal BalancePortfolio Weight SP 500 $ 25709139.28 % Bitcoin $ 13350720.40 % Tesla $ 447636.84 % Alphabet $ 379545.80 % Cash $ 370075.65 % NVIDIA $ 358685.48 % Amazon $ 244453.73 % Apple $ 231363.53 % Microsoft $ 229743.51 % Meta $ 190232.91 % TSMC $ 188112.87 % Total $ 654579100.00 %"

I have been pretty disciplined so far, saving a lot and mainly investing in VOO with a little bit in other tech but was wondering after passing the 500k milestone given my age if it makes sense to be more risky. Currently my portfolio is as such \\* GOOGL: \\~$120k \\* Other Big Tech (AAPL, AMZN, META): \\~$15k \\* VOO / VFFSX (401k): \\~$400k \\* Cash: \\~$15k Instead of continuing to strictly only invest in S&P 500, I’m considering shifting some of the VOO weight into QQQM for more tech exposure and also investing into more individual plays I actually believe in such as ASTS, RDDT, ONDS, and TE. Is it crazy for to move from this strictly VOO/chill strategy when I’m already on a good trajectory? If I start buying these higher-risk/growth stocks, should I keep that in my taxable brokerage or try to keep it in my Roth/IRA? (Thinking about the tax implications if one of these actually moons). Thanks for any advice!",

      "selftext": "I'm long GSIT with a decent amount of jan call contracts as well. Stock ripped again closing Friday at $7.65 (+26%) on massive volume after Nvidia's Christmas Eve bombshell: a $20B non-exclusive licensing deal with Groq, scooping up their inference tech + CEO/founder Jonathan Ross and key talent. Basically Nvidia neutralizing a big inference rival, which lit a fire under alternative AI chip plays like GSI's power-efficient Gemini APU for edge apps (drones, defense). GSIT's story: Small-cap semiconductor vet pivoting hard into AI with compute-in-memory tech. Q2 FY26 revenue $6.4M (+39% YoY), 55% margins, but still loss-making (R&D burn). $50M raise in October gives runway and no need for dilution . Management hyped ongoing defense POCs + multi-modal LLM optimizations on Gemini-II. Biggest near-term catalyst: Initial benchmarks for multi-modal LLMs (vision + text for edge) expected Any Day Now by Dec 31, 2025 per earnings call. Prior PR showed 98% less energy vs Nvidia, and strong results could validate their edge over power-hungry GPUs amid the inference shift. Next up: Needham Growth Conf presentation Jan 15, Q3 earnings late Jan/early Feb, Gemini-II pilot shipments H1 '26. Volatile speculative play, but Nvidia/Groq news gave it serious tailwinds. Watching closely into year-end. if those benchmarks drop hot, will fly more. Stock hit 18 on this PR back in Oct and pulled back and I expect fireworks this week. Key points: GPU-class performance – The Gemini-I APU delivered comparable throughput to NVIDIA’s A6000 GPU on RAG workloads. Massive energy advantage – The APU delivers over 98% lower energy consumption than a GPU over various large corpora datasets, underscoring its efficiency and sustainability. Faster and more efficient than CPUs – The APU’s unique design allows it to perform retrieval tasks several times faster than standard CPUs, shortening total processing time by up to 80%.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone. My portfolio has been very aggressive with 70% QQQM and 30% BTC for the last six years, and it has performed very well. However, now that I’ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about long-term risk, I’m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC. I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing. I’m planning to hold this portfolio long term (30 years). Here’s what I came up with: US (50%) \\- VOO: 20% (Blend) — 99 / 1 / 0 \\- SPMO: 10% (Momentum) — 100 / 0 / 0 \\- XMMO: 10% (Momentum + Size) — 55 / 44 / 0 \\- AVUV: 10% (Value + Size) — 0 / 58 / 42 International Developed (20%) \\- IDMO: 10% (Momentum) — 92 / 5 / 0 \\- AVDV: 10% (Value + Size) — 1 / 44 / 54 International Emerging (20%) \\- AVEM: 10% (Blend) — 62 / 25 / 13 \\- AVES: 10% (Value) — 46 / 32 / 21 Speculative (10%) \\- FBTC: 5% \\- Pre IPO companies: 5% \\* After the dash, I listed size exposure (Large / Mid / Small caps) in percentages. Things I’m unsure about: \\- Should I keep VOO, or move fully into Momentum and Value? \\- Does it make sense to keep XMMO, given that it has the highest expense ratio (0.35%) of all the ETFs listed? \\- Should I replace SPMO and XMMO with a single momentum fund like VFMO with ER 0.13%, which has Large / Mid / Small exposure of 56 / 21 / 22? It defiantly painful to watch how VFMO (combined momentum in small, mid, large) underperform VOO but I guess it is part of factor investment. \\- Should I add AVDE (cap ratio 67 / 24 / 9) to International Developed and split equally between it and IDMO? \\- I feel like AVEM overlaps too much with AVES, but I’m not sure what a better alternative would be. Momentum strategies don’t seem to work well in emerging markets (e.g., EEMO). Another option could be AVEE (size tilt, 0 / 23 / 77). \\- I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value (30%). In theory, Value should be one of the best-performing assets over the long run (30 years). Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value (AVUV)? I still want to have some top companies that not always be in SPMO but presented in VOO. Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not have. \\- I also found multi-factor rotational funds (DYNF, PALC, OMFL) but not sure what to think about them Overall, I feel that while momentum is nice to have, I still want consistent exposure to big tech, so I need to have VOO as well. Any other advice is really appreciated. Thanks!",

However now that I ’ ve reached pretty large sum and started thinking more seriously about longterm risk I ’ m seeing less and less sense in staying fully concentrated in QQQM and BTC . I decided to build a new portfolio and after reading many articles I became interested in factor investing . I ’ m planning to hold this portfolio long term 30 years . Here ’ s what I came up with US 50 % VOO 20 % Blend — 99 1 0 SPMO 10 % Momentum — 100 0 0 XMMO 10 % Momentum Size — 55 44 0 AVUV 10 % Value Size — 0 58 42 International Developed 20 % IDMO 10 % Momentum — 92 5 0 AVDV 10 % Value Size — 1 44 54 International Emerging 20 % AVEM 10 % Blend — 62 25 13 AVES 10 % Value — 46 32 21 Speculative 10 % FBTC 5 % Pre IPO companies 5 % After the dash I listed size exposure Large Mid Small caps in percentages .

Momentum strategies don ’ t seem to work well in emerging markets e.g . EEMO . Another option could be AVEE size tilt 0 23 77 . I feel the portfolio has too little exposure to Value 30 % . In theory Value should be one of the bestperforming assets over the long run 30 years . Should I increase my allocation at least for US Value AVUV I still want to have some top companies that not_always be in SPMO but presented in VOO . Same with AVEM it has companies I want to own that AVES and AVEE do not_have . I also found multifactor rotational funds DYNF PALC OMFL but not_sure what to think about them Overall I feel that while momentum is nice to have I still want consistent exposure to big tech so I need to have VOO as well . Any other advice is really appreciated . Thanks"

Most ETFs as you can see but am just looking for your honest opinion",

      "selftext": "Been thinking about this variation on buy-low-sell-high for a while, and wondering if someone here can help. I give as much as I can to various charities and causes. Not rich enough to be in a high tax bracket, but enough that giving tax-efficiently helps. Since I don't have the nerve for stock trading, I'm mostly in boring sector funds and such. So it's rare that I have significantly appreciated assets to give away. I'm wondering if there could be (or already is) a fund with a portfolio whose components swing widely, but on net do no worse than the market. Then the investor can store money there, giving away whatever's made the best gains in any given year, and wait for the rest to go through ups and downs. Does this make sense at all? Is anyone already doing it? . . . OK, either this is a silly, impractical or redundant idea, or I'm expressing it poorly. The motivation: one might be fortunate to be able to donate to a 501(c)(30 or other qualified charity more than the current $108k tax-free limit from savings, payouts, a home sale, whatever. Or one might like to make smaller donations in any given year, but have no highly appreciated assets that could be donated directly, avoiding capital gains. And there are circumstances where one large gift might have much more impact than multiple smaller ones spread over several years. So I'm asking if there is some kind of managed investment portfolio designed for large swings but net general asset preservation with modest growth. Then there would often be some asset with high short-term gains that could be \"harvested\" for tax-efficient donation, while other components are bouncing up and down. No, I'm not any kind of finance expert, or even very interested in money management and investing. But I am committed to giving away most of what I have, to the benefit of a variety of worthy causes, and am seeking ways to do that when it's needed rather than when convenient for me, and as tax-efficiently as possible. Apologies if this is an unworthy question; if so, I'll delete it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been thinking about this variation on buylowsellhigh for a while and wondering if someone here can help . I give as much as I can to various charities and causes . Not_rich enough to be in a high tax bracket but enough that giving taxefficiently helps . Since I dont have the nerve for stock trading Im mostly in boring sector funds and such . So its rare that I have significantly appreciated assets to give away . Im wondering if there could be or already is a fund with a portfolio whose components swing widely but on net do no_worse than the market . Then the investor can store money there giving away whatevers made the best gains in any given year and wait for the rest to go through ups and downs . Does this make sense at all Is anyone already doing it . . . OK either this is a silly impractical or redundant idea or Im expressing it poorly . The motivation one might be fortunate to be able to donate to a 501c30 or other qualified charity more than the current $ 108k taxfree limit from savings payouts a home sale whatever . Or one might like to make smaller donations in any given year but have no_highly appreciated assets that could be donated directly avoiding capital gains . And there are circumstances where one large gift might have much more impact than multiple smaller ones spread over several years . So Im asking if there is some kind of managed investment portfolio designed for large swings but net general asset preservation with modest growth . Then there would often be some asset with high shortterm gains that could be harvested for taxefficient donation while other components are bouncing up and down . No_Im not_any kind of finance expert or even very interested in money management and investing . But I am committed to giving away most of what I have to the benefit of a variety of worthy causes and am seeking ways to do that when its needed rather than when convenient for me and as taxefficiently as possible . Apologies if this is an unworthy question if so Ill delete it ."

      "selftext": "Hey everyone. Been doing some huge discovery of what I want a 10 year strategy to be. Here is my idea, let me know what You guys think. So say I have 55k. I buy 1000 shares of QQQI at 54.60 Currently a Jan 16 55 call is going for $0.35 or Feb 20 55 call for 0.60 cents. So, I buy the 1000 shares, and I sell covered calls. The covered calls could add about 0.5-0.7% every month. I will not let these calls assign, this is because I want to collect the monthly payout (13.5% yearly paid monthly) every month without a skip. So, if QQQI drifts up, I roll the covered calls forward and up for break even or a small credit. If QQQI goes down I let call expire and sell another one. Reinvesting the monthly payout and the premium from the covered calls back into QQQI will really help this position compound. At the same time, I can sell puts secured by my portfolio, on stocks I want to own. Small Amounts though. I’d be looking for another 0.7-1%/month yield on the portfolio from cash secured puts. I’d then use the put premiums to make positions in equity stocks. The QQQI would be held in tax free accounts the cash secured puts would be sold in my taxable account (Canada) If you are picking up what I am putting down, what is the drawback to this? I am estimating I could get a 25%+ yield as long as I properly manage the secured puts and follow very strict rules on them.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone . Been doing some huge discovery of what I want a 10 year strategy to be . Here is my idea let me know what You guys think . So say I have 55k . I buy 1000 shares of QQQI at 54.60 Currently a Jan 16 55 call is going for $ 0.35 or Feb 20 55 call for 0.60 cents . So I buy the 1000 shares and I sell covered calls . The covered calls could add about 0.50.7 % every month . I will not_let these calls assign this is because I want to collect the monthly payout 13.5 % yearly paid monthly every month without a skip . So if QQQI drifts up I roll the covered calls forward and up for break even or a small credit . If QQQI goes down I let call expire and sell another one . Reinvesting the monthly payout and the premium from the covered calls back into QQQI will really help this position compound . At the same time I can sell puts secured by my portfolio on stocks I want to own . Small Amounts though . I ’ d be looking for another 0.71 % month yield on the portfolio from cash secured puts . I ’ d then use the put premiums to make positions in equity stocks . The QQQI would be held in tax free accounts the cash secured puts would be sold in my taxable account Canada If you are picking up what I am putting down what is the drawback to this I am estimating I could get a 25 % yield as long as I properly manage the secured puts and follow very strict rules on them ."

      "title": "A lot of the takes on silver miners and silver itself on here are crap. Here’s what’s happening: Silver’s Christmas Miracle",
      "selftext": "What is happening? I want to address the nature of the sharp rise in silver. Some of it is SLV shorts getting liquidated. That is only a smaller part. the main difference between now and what happened with the Hunt brothers is the Shanghai exchange, which isa primarily physical market, compared to the comex or LMBA, which are more paper markets. Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange, whereas comex or LMBA, despite whatever they say, have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real, physical silver bars. There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults. The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper. One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements. That is what killed the Hunt brothers. For a more recent game played, remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME? However, the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up, and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not on margin or for speculation. They need it to make money. Ideally, the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage (for comparison, look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple, even if execution was a challenge). However, if the demand in Shanghai cannot be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York, the spread will persist, as we have seen for the past few days. And it cannot be fixed by lowering the price in the west. That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges, which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle. What happens here? Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price. In a precious metals bull market, silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode. If you are a fool who doesn’t believe in technical analysis, sorry, but you are SOL. The spread between the western and eastern price can widen. In many ways, a $2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $10 spread. AndI don’t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise. It’s a 45 year cup and handle. It’s not going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive, massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels. Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos. But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not following silver: 1. ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed. How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it’s home exchange? Coeur mining maybe? Can’t even think of a second. US just doesn’t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining. 2. ⁠Stocks are different from commodities. Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply. They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios. Sometimes, stocks need to consolidate at resistance. 3. ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $30 strike. 4. ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail, and lots of people don’t understand what is really happening. This is not a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers. This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA cannot make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements. In fact, lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China. Since the average retail investor has no clue what is happening, they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price. Miners don’t make money from spikes. They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time. However, once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China, we will see what they do. I’d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter: If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not being reliable sources of physical silver, and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver (disclaimer: that’s a speculation. I and others believe it to be true but can’t prove it), then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE. What happens then? A side note: silver follows gold. Know what else tends to follow gold? a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL. We (the US) are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $60/barrel. That’s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming, and current prices are not a crisis. Dunno how to spell that out more clearly.",

      "selftext_processed": "What is happening I want to address the nature of the sharp rise in silver . Some of it is SLV shorts getting liquidated . That is only a smaller part . the main difference between now and what happened with the Hunt brothers is the Shanghai exchange which isa primarily physical market compared to the comex or LMBA which are more paper markets . Industrial buyers in China are the main buyers on the Shanghai exchange whereas comex or LMBA despite whatever they say have functioned for a long time as a way for traders to speculate on price without actually getting delivery of real physical silver bars . There are hundreds of times more paper ounces of silver than real silver in their vaults . The exchanges make a lot of money being the exchange for that paper . One way that LMBA and comex have prevented the price of silver from getting out of control or prevented a stampede for everyone asking for delivery is hiking up margin requirements . That is what killed the Hunt brothers . For a more recent game played remember when market clearinghouses basically made all the brokers turn off the buy button for GME However the existence of the Shanghai exchange allows for price arbitrage if the price goes up and they buyers in Shanghai are buying not_on margin or for speculation . They need it to make money . Ideally the price in the west should go up to meet the price in the east because of trading arbitrage for comparison look up SBF and the kimchi premium and how much money he made from a concept so simple even if execution was a challenge . However if the demand in Shanghai can not be easily met by draining the vaults in London and New York the spread will persist as we have seen for the past few days . And it can not be fixed by lowering the price in the west . That will only cause the silver drain to happen faster and eventually severely hurt the credibility of western exchanges which already looked bad with the LME nickel debacle . What happens here Pull out your crayons and start learning about fib extensions for rough price targets OR follow the gold to silver ratio IN ADDITION to watching gold momentum and price . In a precious metals bull market silver over the long term should keep moving as long as gold is in bull mode . If you are a fool who doesn ’ t believe in technical analysis sorry but you are SOL . The spread between the western and eastern price can widen . In many ways a $ 2 spread is just as irrational and disconnected as a $ 10 spread . AndI don ’ t recommend jumping in front of a moving train just because us silver investors or speculators are making noise . It ’ s a 45 year cup and handle . It ’ s not_going to play out in the just one year unless that one year precludes or includes massive massive hyperinflation on Argentina levels . Show anybody from Argentina the chart of silver in USD and ask them what they think of it and you will probably see it looks a lot like it did in the beginning of hyperinflation in Argentinian pesos . But old timer silver and goldbugs will also tell you we are due for that so 🤷‍♂️ . Regarding silver miners not_following silver 1 . ⁠the tsx and asx have been closed . How many US major primary silver miners or significant silver producers have the NYSE on as it ’ s home exchange Coeur mining maybe Can ’ t even think of a second . US just doesn ’ t have a good exchange for small to mid cap mining . 2 . ⁠Stocks are different from commodities . Commodities will trade a lot more in line with physical demand and supply . They can get more easily unanchored from the technicals in a lot of scenarios . Sometimes stocks need to consolidate at resistance . 3 . ⁠Call wall for SILJ at $ 30 strike . 4 . ⁠Christmas week is mostly retail and lots of people don ’ t understand what is really happening . This is not_a margin fueled frenzy like with the Hunt brothers . This is primary demand from China for industrial purposes and the comex and LMBA can not make prices go down by shutting off the buy button or hiking margin requirements . In fact lowering the price just makes the problem of physical shortages worse because traders can get physical silver from the west at a discount and sell it at a premium in China . Since the average retail investor has no_clue what is happening they are going to expect a spike up and a spike down in the silver price . Miners don ’ t make money from spikes . They need higher for longer because they have their volumes of output over time . However once better connected institutions come back from holiday get wind of what is happening in China we will see what they do . I ’ d like to pose to everyone reading this a question posed by Eric Yeung on twitter If the comex and LMBA are sucked dry of silver and exposed for not_being reliable sources of physical silver and SLV is caught having paper instead of physical silver disclaimer that ’ s a speculation . I and others believe it to be true but can ’ t prove it then the miners and PSLV are the only way for investors to get real exposure to silver on the NYSE . What happens then A side note silver follows gold . Know what else tends to follow gold a three letter word beginning with OIL and ending with OIL . We the US are at risk of invading Venezuela for oil at a time when oil is $ 60barrel . That ’ s only a smart move if you are fixing a crisis now or if you see a crisis coming and current prices are not_a crisis . Dunno how to spell that out more clearly ."

      "selftext": "“We envision future NVDA platforms where GPU and LPU co-exist in a rack, connected seamlessly with NVDA’s NVLInk networking fabric. Groq’s LPU employ a large amount (hundreds of MB) of fast on-chip SRAM memory as primary storage for AI model weights and working data,” wrote Bank of America analyst Vivek Arya to clients in a research note shared with me. “Longer-term, we think the potential Groq deal could be strategic, similar to NVDA’s Apr’20 Mellanox acquisition that is now the foundation of NVDA’s networking/AI scaling moat.” The deal may help Nvidia technology work even better at AI inference. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks inference will be a much bigger market than training AI models, driving substantially more demand for infrastructure, including its chips, software, and networking gear. “The amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do,” Huang told CNBC earlier this year. “On Dec. 9, Guilfoyle said Nvidia had “survived a short-term sell-off,” prompting him to put a $225 stock price target on its shares. Nvidia’s shares have strengthened since then, leading him to update his thinking. “The shares are engaged in an attempt to take and hold the $188​ pivot created by the newly formed bullish double bottom pattern,” wrote Guilfoyle. “The stock’s reading for relative strength and its daily Moving Average Convergence Divergence are both also in a better place at this time.” Guilfoyle’s new Nvidia stock target: $235.” Tbh I think Nvda can go higher than 235 before eoy 2026. Thoughts? Why or why not?",

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks inference will be a much bigger market than training AI models driving substantially more demand for infrastructure including its chips software and networking gear . “ The amount of computation necessary to do that reasoning process is 100 times more than what we used to do ” Huang told CNBC earlier this year . “ On Dec. 9 Guilfoyle said Nvidia had “ survived a shortterm selloff ” prompting him to put a $ 225 stock price target on its shares .

      "selftext": "Okay listen up here bros. First of all, no I am not trying to pump my “bags”. Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open, it wouldn’t move it a needle. With that being said, I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026, I believe that energy equities could outperform. Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $55 (crude). Yes, an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver. Read that again. Can it go lower? Sure. Is it sustainable? No. I think in hindsight, this will have been obvious. Sometimes, things are cheap enough. Why am I bullish on oil? Well, I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it. I will try to keep this short and concise. In no particular order : 1. The massive \"supply glut\" is overstated and demand is not as weak as forecasted either. Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 (not that IEA has any real credibility. They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row). 2. Most of the world's oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale. There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked (or is close). Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices, contrary to what the Mango man wants, their production will not be growing. 3. XLE makes up less than 3% of SPY. Just going back to the historical average of 6\\~8% would imply massive gains for the equities. The bullish case is not necessairly dependent on crude hitting $100. 4. Seasonality. Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1. 5. Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point. One of my favorite boomers to listen to, Rick Rule, says that you don't need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities. He thinks XOM is selling at 60% of NPV, meaning at 40% discount. I'm personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant. The Canadian O&G stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and I'm betting that he will enable them. He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US O&G names. I'm also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks. Here’s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats. XOM / CVX / COP / CNQ / SU / OXY / DVN Anyways, that's it for now. I'm off to play some poker. See you degens on Monday.",

Even if all of you brokies liquidated everything and went into CNQ on Monday at open it wouldn ’ t move it a needle . With that being said I know you are all busy chasing shiny metals right now but going into 2026 I believe that energy equities could outperform . Oil has pretty much been eating shit all year and is currently sitting at around $ 55 crude . Yes an entire barrel of oil is now cheaper than an ounce of silver . Read that again . Can it go lower Sure . Is it sustainable No_I think in hindsight this will have been obvious . Sometimes things are cheap enough . Why am I bullish on oil Well I listen to and read a lot of what old and rich boomers have to say when I am bored and a lot of them seem to be bullish on it . I will try to keep this short and concise . In no_particular order 1 . The massive supply glut is overstated and demand is not_as weak as forecasted either . Even the IEA which have been historically bearish recently moved their goalpost on peak oil demand from 2030 to 2050 not that IEA has any real credibility . They have been wrong on their oil demand forecasts for like 17 years in a row . 2 . Most of the worlds oil supply growth since the shale revolution came from US shale . There is real evidence that suggest that shale production has peaked or is close . Their best assets are facing major depletion and at current oil prices contrary to what the Mango man wants their production will not_be growing . 3 . XLE makes up less than 3 % of SPY . Just going back to the historical average of 68 % would imply massive gains for the equities . The bullish case is not_necessairly dependent on crude hitting $ 100 . 4 . Seasonality . Crude typically has strong seasonality in Q1 . 5 . Any geopolitical risks are just a bonus at this point . One of my favorite boomers to listen to Rick Rule says that you dont need to go far down the quality trail when it comes to oil equities . He thinks XOM is selling at 60 % of NPV meaning at 40 % discount . Im personally all in on CNQ which is a Canadian oil sands giant . The Canadian OG stocks trade at an even further discount to the US peers because of our political incompetence but Carney is a smart man and understands how important our oil and gas sector is to our economy and Im betting that he will enable them . He has already reversed some of the Trudeau era policies and I think this is why they have been outperforming the US OG names . Im also Canadian myself and there are tax advantages for holding TSX stocks . Here ’ s some random tickers to consider since a rising tide lifts all boats . XOM CVX COP CNQ SU OXY DVN Anyways thats it for now . Im off to play some poker . See you degens on Monday ."

They had a decent quarter, ARR, Revenue and earnings growth but missed hard on the guidance cutting the stock price. I work in tech nationally. Every company that I talk to (from regional banks and trucking companies to global casinos and the largest retailer on the planet) are switching from VMWare to Nutanix. Broadcom has destroyed VMware and raised the prices killing off the lifetime license model and forcing upgrades - they’re bleeding customers now. The only truly viable competition is to go hypervisor and that’s really only for MS customers who are only MS. This feels like a long-term win, but I wanted to go check it here. What are you seeing beyond the headlines how do you think the stock will do?",

      "selftext": "I reckon the market is richly valued, concentrated in U.S. growth, and probably on the brink of a substantial correction. But I'm also worried about bonds. Treasuries are becoming an alarming credit risk, TIPS are based on dubious inflation calculations, corporates pay a low premium, and other reliable nations have debt problems just as bad. I'm neutral on real estate and emerging markets, but regard them as distinct supporting players for the allocation, so it's hard to lean on them more. I don't mind keeping some cash to exploit a near-term correction, but mindful of upside risk in the meantime. Gold and crypto are not for me. Port consists of mainly static IRAs with my life's savings. There's a modest RMD, and my earning potential has tanked in my mid 50s. Strategy mix is more active than passive. I've conceded some gains to mitigate risk, but still see risk compounding everywhere I look, and my tolerance isn't getting any higher. Here's where I'm at: * Emerging 6% * Foreign 25% * Domestic (value) 17% * REITs 12% * Bonds 10% * TIPS 9% * Treasuries 11% * Cash 10% Basically a moderate 65/35 port with a bias toward foreign, value, and cash. Is this the best I can do?",

      "selftext_processed": "I reckon the market is richly valued concentrated in U.S. growth and probably on the brink of a substantial correction . But Im also worried about bonds . Treasuries are becoming an alarming credit risk TIPS are based on dubious inflation calculations corporates pay a low premium and other reliable nations have debt problems just as bad . Im neutral on real estate and emerging markets but regard them as distinct supporting players for the allocation so its hard to lean on them more . I dont mind keeping some cash to exploit a nearterm correction but mindful of upside risk in the meantime . Gold and crypto are not_for me . Port consists of mainly static IRAs with my lifes savings . Theres a modest RMD and my earning potential has tanked in my mid 50s . Strategy mix is more active than passive . Ive conceded some gains to mitigate risk but still see risk compounding everywhere I look and my tolerance isnt getting any higher . Heres where Im at Emerging 6 % Foreign 25 % Domestic value 17 % REITs 12 % Bonds 10 % TIPS 9 % Treasuries 11 % Cash 10 % Basically a moderate 6535 port with a bias toward foreign value and cash . Is this the best I can do"

The data is [here]( In essence for 2025, the top 10 recommendations based on mentions returned 68.3% versus 18% for the SPY. For 24(and based on returns since 24), the top 10 recommendations based on mentions returned 58.6% versus 46% for the SPY. The top 20 actually hit 116% and if you went by upvotes, the top 10 hit 195%. Yes a lot of that is mostly due to the inclusion of certain stocks like RKLB, NVDA, ASTS and PLTR which carried the but still pretty interesting data to look at. I do also have the data for 22 and while those recommendations did terrible the year of(down 47.1% for the top 10 versus SPY being down 19.9%), they recovered quite well and the top picks are up 92.3% since 2022 versus 44.5% for the SPY.",

      "selftext": "The EIA predicts WTI to be in the low 50s in 2026 because of a predicted oil glut and economic slowdown. However historically they have been more wrong than right. The 2010–2014: The EIA chronically underestimated US production growth for years, leading to perpetually \"too high\" price forecasts until the 2014 crash reset reality. ​2019-2022: The EIA has a bias toward underestimating demand rebound resilience. Historically the EIA has missed demand growth to the downside in 11 of the last 13 years. ​The 2022-2024: Now the EIA claims \"remarkable accuracy\" for the last 2 years. However it was a range-bound market ($70–$90). Predicting stability during a stable period is not skill; it's luck. The EIA does not forecast. They are basically undergrad level linear regressions lover. The current EIA forecast for 2026 contains a massive logic error that history suggests will fail. EIA Prediction: WTI Prices crash to $51/bbl. US Production hits ~13.6 million bpd (record highs). That is not supported by reality. 2015/2016 when WTI hit $50, US rig counts collapsed, and production rolled over. The EIA assumes Volume is independent of Price. In reality, low prices cure high supplies. What the EIA's supply glut prediction basically has priced in maximum pessimism and an irrational producer that keeps the tap on at a loss and the market believes it. This in my opinion creates the perfect arb opportunity to buy cheap crude now and flip for a profit in the future.",

The 2010–2014 The EIA chronically underestimated US production growth for years leading to perpetually too high price forecasts until the 2014 crash reset reality . ​20192022 The EIA has a bias toward underestimating demand rebound resilience . Historically the EIA has missed demand growth to the downside in 11 of the last 13 years . ​The 20222024 Now the EIA claims remarkable accuracy for the last 2 years . However it was a rangebound market $ 70– $ 90 . Predicting stability during a stable period is not_skill its luck . The EIA does not_forecast . They are basically undergrad level linear regressions lover . The current EIA forecast for 2026 contains a massive logic error that history suggests will fail . EIA Prediction WTI Prices crash to $ 51bbl . US Production hits 13.6 million bpd record highs . That is not_supported by reality . 20152016 when WTI hit $ 50 US rig counts collapsed and production rolled over . The EIA assumes Volume is independent of Price . In reality low prices cure high supplies . What the EIAs supply glut prediction basically has priced in maximum pessimism and an irrational producer that keeps the tap on at a loss and the market believes it . This in my opinion creates the perfect arb opportunity to buy cheap crude now and flip for a profit in the future ."

      "selftext": "Everyone is investing more and more money in solar panels, electric cars, electronics and other such things, but everyone forgets that the increase in the price of silver has a negative impact on the industry. Higher prices, less profit. Key Industries Affected Renewable Energy: Silver is a crucial component in solar panels, and accelerating global clean energy adoption means demand in this sector is high. Electronics & Technology: Its unmatched electrical and thermal conductivity makes it indispensable in semiconductors, 5G networks, and general electronics infrastructure. Automotive: Electric vehicles require a significantly higher amount of silver per unit compared to traditional vehicles, primarily for their power systems and sensors. Not yet, but we will probably see a negative impact after the first or second quarter results. So, is anyone thinking in a long term and will do some stocks rotation?",

      "title": "Energy Plays - Tech, Space, Industrials, and even your mother's basement need it.",
      "selftext": "As of late 2025, the transition from AI hype to infrastructure utility has made power availability a primary constraint for the Mag7, which has been highlighted repeatedly in numerous mag7 investor calls and more importantly evidenced in their drive to supply some of their own energy (i.e. solar panel initiatives & expenditure, Amazon hydrogen electrolysers). Big Tech is showing clear focus to source backup power, and critically stable baseload \"clean firm\" power to sustain massive data centre clusters. In my previous DD I outlined how in particular amongst the energy sector players (CEG, NRG, D, DUK) Viagra stood out for me. Vistra Corp (VST) is solidifying its role in this transition, highlighted by a 20-year PPA for 1,200 MW at its Comanche Peak nuclear plant. This deal, coupled with a December 12 upgrade to Investment Grade (BBB-) by S&P Global, provides the locked-in cash flow required for large-scale expansion. Example in point, September 2025, Vistra approved a $1 billion internal development project to triple the size of its existing Permian Basin Power Plant in Texas to erect 860 MW of new advanced gas units. Falling interest rates act as a refinancing benefit and encourage further USA widespread tech and industrial Capex and expenditure, leading to future elevated energy demand. Vistra holds a unique advantage by dominating the PJM and ERCOT markets. Texas (ERCOT) remains the top destination for manufacturing reshoring and the second-largest data center pipeline, allowing Vistra to capture high \"scarcity rents\" via its gas and solar fleet. In the PJM \"Data Center Alley,\" Vistra’s Energy Harbor assets provide critical nuclear baseload. A landmark FERC order on December 18, 2025, cleared the path for data center co-location, allowing hyperscalers to bypass five-year grid connection queues by connecting \"behind the meter\" directly to Vistra’s plants. Vistra is set to benefit from increasing tailwinds in AI demand, reshoring, and general increase in electrification. Regulated utilities like Dominion or Duke are capped by rate-base expansion, but Vistra operates in wholesale markets where structural scarcity translates immediately into higher realized prices. Constellation (CEG) wins on nuclear purity, yet Vistra offers superior earnings torque and margination. When grid conditions tighten in PJM or ERCOT, Vistra’s generation supply range of nuclear and gas allows higher spark spreads to flow directly to the bottom line, providing faster growth than traditional peers by using most efficient margin selection. **Fundamental Metrics** The current fundamental landscape for the three leaders is defined by the following live metrics (as of Dec 26, 2025): * Vistra (VST): Price ~$161.70. Forward P/E ~12-14x, EV/EBITDA ~14.3x, ROE ~22.6%. 2026 EBITDA guidance initiated at $6.8B–$7.6B. High asymmetry as the market begins pricing ERCOT scarcity as a structural constant rather than a seasonal cycle. Zack's stock analysis firm quotes \"VST’s trailing 12-month return on equity (“ROE”) is 64.04%, way ahead of its industry average of 9.84%. VST’s better ROE than its industry indicates that the company is utilizing its funds more efficiently than its industry peers to generate returns.\" * Constellation (CEG): Price ~$360.46. Forward P/E ~41.6x, EV/EBITDA ~21.5x, ROE ~20.3%. Nuclear scarcity commands a premium, with the market pricing in long-term \"clean firm\" contracts like the Microsoft/TMI restart. * NRG Energy (NRG): Price ~$160.81. Forward P/E ~22.8x, P/S ~1.09x, ROE ~60.6% (driven by aggressive buybacks). Reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA of $3.9B–$4.0B. Operates as a flexible \"reliability provider\" with high sensitivity to gas-spark spreads. **Technical movement** Financially, Vistra appears to be attempting a bottoming and consolidating from recent highs near $220, with reduced volume on red days, and choppy sideways range trading and higher lows. A December pull-back to the $160 range cleared out significant short-term speculators, leaving a shareholder base that is now 91% institutional. Put to Call volume shows significant hedging and Put bias, with Max pain in December and January floating between $160-$180 depending on expiry. Movements above $165 are likely to trigger a squeeze to $180 levels. **Institutional signals** Institutional investment is increasing AND recent, notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to ~10,935,188 shares (buying an additional ~2,074,364 shares, increasing portfolio holding by 23% at an approximated cost basis of $170-180 per share) in Q3 2025. Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14, 2025, with underlying cost basis approximately $166. There is no disclosure of those positions being sold (which require disclosure) = technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $166. Breakeven would sit around a throbbing $180. Analysts firmly maintain a majority \"Strong Buy\" and \"Outperform\" consensus, citing Vistra’s strong 2026 trajectory. With average price targets at $243 and high-end estimates reaching $295, the current technicals are giving hints of a potential valuation re-rating as Vistra continues to aggressively expand as a core AI/infra/industry Energy infrastructure play. **Recent downturn** Two EPS misses, have sent VST into a correction. GAAP revenue misses have been largely an accounting Mark-to-Market derivative accounting write-off, rather than a fundamental business downturn, with YoY revenue, profit margins, EBITDA all increasing. Q3 showed slight softening due to unplanned outages which do not appear to feature in latest investor calls and A&A. Looking forward at Q4 and EPS Beat/Meet/Miss probabilities: Vistra’s (VST) Q4 2025 earnings outlook projects 114% YoY EPS surge to $2.45 and $5.5B–$6.0B in revenue, supported by a 6% generation increase to ~51,000 GWh following the 2,600 MW Lotus acquisition. The 7% colder-than-normal winter and record PJM capacity pricing act as tailwinds, although 2% reduced commercial availability (down from 95%) and weak retail remain risks. A high probability of an EBITDA and FCF beat ($3.3B–$3.5B guidance) is bolstered by Nuclear Production Tax Credits and a 30% share reduction since 2021, though GAAP revenue may be subject to mark-to-market derivative accounting again. $3.7B in liquidity and 100% of 2025 volumes hedged, mass growth is going to be largely driven by new contracts both finalised and future. Probabilities sit at: Beat: 65% Meat: 25% Miss: 10% *Disclaimer;* Not financial advice. I hold a position and am likely to add more on technical signals. This info is majority composed by myself ~70% with AI used to gross-format, and 3 AI models and personal research have been used to check veracity and cross-check information.

      "selftext_processed": "As of late 2025 the transition from AI hype to infrastructure utility has made power availability a primary constraint for the Mag7 which has been highlighted repeatedly in numerous mag7 investor calls and more importantly evidenced in their drive to supply some of their own energy i.e . solar panel initiatives expenditure Amazon hydrogen electrolysers . Big Tech is showing clear focus to source backup power and critically stable baseload clean firm power to sustain massive data centre clusters . In my previous DD I outlined how in particular amongst the energy sector players CEG NRG D DUK Viagra stood out for me . Vistra Corp VST is solidifying its role in this transition highlighted by a 20year PPA for 1200 MW at its Comanche Peak nuclear plant . This deal coupled with a December 12 upgrade to Investment Grade BBB by SP Global provides the lockedin cash flow required for largescale expansion . Example in point September 2025 Vistra approved a $ 1 billion internal development project to triple the size of its existing Permian Basin Power Plant in Texas to erect 860 MW of new advanced gas units . Falling interest rates act as a refinancing benefit and encourage further USA widespread tech and industrial Capex and expenditure leading to future elevated energy demand . Vistra holds a unique advantage by dominating the PJM and ERCOT markets . Texas ERCOT remains the top destination for manufacturing reshoring and the secondlargest data center pipeline allowing Vistra to capture high scarcity rents via its gas and solar fleet . In the PJM Data Center Alley Vistra ’ s Energy Harbor assets provide critical nuclear baseload . A landmark FERC order on December 18 2025 cleared the path for data center colocation allowing hyperscalers to bypass fiveyear grid connection queues by connecting behind the meter directly to Vistra ’ s plants . Vistra is set to benefit from increasing tailwinds in AI demand reshoring and general increase in electrification . Regulated utilities like Dominion or Duke are capped by ratebase expansion but Vistra operates in wholesale markets where structural scarcity translates immediately into higher realized prices . Constellation CEG wins on nuclear purity yet Vistra offers superior earnings torque and margination . When grid conditions tighten in PJM or ERCOT Vistra ’ s generation supply range of nuclear and gas allows higher spark spreads to flow directly to the bottom line providing faster growth than traditional peers by using most efficient margin selection . Fundamental Metrics The current fundamental landscape for the three leaders is defined by the following live metrics as of Dec 26 2025 Vistra VST Price $ 161.70 . Forward PE 1214x EVEBITDA 14.3x ROE 22.6 % . 2026 EBITDA guidance initiated at $ 6.8B– $ 7.6B . High asymmetry as the market begins pricing ERCOT scarcity as a structural constant rather than a seasonal cycle . Zacks stock analysis firm quotes VST ’ s trailing 12month return on equity “ ROE ” is 64.04 % way ahead of its industry average of 9.84 % . VST ’ s better ROE than its industry indicates that the company is utilizing its funds more efficiently than its industry peers to generate returns . Constellation CEG Price $ 360.46 . Forward PE 41.6x EVEBITDA 21.5x ROE 20.3 % . Nuclear scarcity commands a premium with the market pricing in longterm clean firm contracts like the MicrosoftTMI restart . NRG Energy NRG Price $ 160.81 . Forward PE 22.8x PS 1.09x ROE 60.6 % driven by aggressive buybacks . Reaffirmed 2025 EBITDA of $ 3.9B– $ 4.0B . Operates as a flexible reliability provider with high sensitivity to gasspark spreads . Technical movement Financially Vistra appears to be attempting a bottoming and consolidating from recent highs near $ 220 with reduced volume on red days and choppy sideways range trading and higher lows . A December pullback to the $ 160 range cleared out significant shortterm speculators leaving a shareholder base that is now 91 % institutional . Put to Call volume shows significant hedging and Put bias with Max pain in December and January floating between $ 160 $ 180 depending on expiry . Movements above $ 165 are likely to trigger a squeeze to $ 180 levels . Institutional signals Institutional investment is increasing AND recent notably JP Morgan increased their VST position to 10935188 shares buying an additional 2074364 shares increasing portfolio holding by 23 % at an approximated cost basis of $ 170180 per share in Q3 2025 . Congressional Records show Nancy Pelosi bought $ 50 calls with 367 DTE on January 14 2025 with underlying cost basis approximately $ 166 . There is no_disclosure of those positions being sold which require disclosure technically she is still holding open call positions expiring January 2026 at an underlying basis of $ 166 . Breakeven would sit around a throbbing $ 180 . Analysts firmly maintain a majority Strong Buy and Outperform consensus citing Vistra ’ s strong 2026 trajectory . With average price targets at $ 243 and highend estimates reaching $ 295 the current technicals are giving hints of a potential valuation rerating as Vistra continues to aggressively expand as a core AIinfraindustry Energy infrastructure play . Recent downturn Two EPS misses have sent VST into a correction . GAAP revenue misses have been largely an accounting MarktoMarket derivative accounting writeoff rather than a fundamental business downturn with YoY revenue profit margins EBITDA all increasing . Q3 showed slight softening due to unplanned outages which do not_appear to feature in latest investor calls and AA . Looking forward at Q4 and EPS BeatMeetMiss probabilities Vistra ’ s VST Q4 2025 earnings outlook projects 114 % YoY EPS surge to $ 2.45 and $ 5.5B– $ 6.0B in revenue supported by a 6 % generation increase to 51000 GWh following the 2600 MW Lotus acquisition . The 7 % colderthannormal winter and record PJM capacity pricing act as tailwinds although 2 % reduced commercial availability down from 95 % and weak retail remain risks . A high probability of an EBITDA and FCF beat $ 3.3B– $ 3.5B guidance is bolstered by Nuclear Production Tax Credits and a 30 % share reduction since 2021 though GAAP revenue may be subject to marktomarket derivative accounting again . $ 3.7B in liquidity and 100 % of 2025 volumes hedged mass growth is going to be largely driven by new contracts both finalised and future .

Now I don't know all the details but from what I was told is that Netflix can't raise their hypothetical counterbid to $35 because shareholders are not enthusiastic about getting WB. Is there any truth to this? I've been told but at the same time I don't think it's not really super clear ro me especially with all that's going on or waiting me into asking this question on why did Netflix even want to pursue Warner Bros if there was going to be problems with acquiring Warner Bros, either from regulators or Paramount being stingy about Warner Bros so much that they are launching a hostile takeover and to get Warner Bros to accept their \"SUPERIOR\" offer? This entire thing is driving me up the wall to where I guess I want to know if Netflix shareholders don't really approve acquisition of Warner Bros meaning Netflix isn't going to raise their bid to $35 Paramount does it. Some people treat this like it's a fact but others kind of come off like it's a no or a unsure thing.",

      "selftext": "I recently took some profits on my TVTX holdings. As I’m considering my next move, I read a 2026 market outlook that really resonated with me, especially the part about the “tug of war between earnings and valuations” While corporate earnings are expected to grow 15% by 2026, the high P/E ratio of 28 could be at risk of contracting. If valuations revert, the overall market gain for the year might end up being only around 5%. Given that tech stocks now make up almost 50% of the index, VOO itself is basically half an “AI fund. With this expectation of “slower growth,” I’m thinking of adjusting my approach a bit. I don’t want to sell all my individual stocks, but I am planning to move some of my profits into VOO. I’ve noticed a lot of people talking about “rotating into VOO” lately. What are your real reasons for doing so? Is it mainly fear of volatility in individual stocks at these highs, or are you also less optimistic about getting outsized returns going forward?",

As I ’ m considering my next move I read a 2026 market outlook that really resonated with me especially the part about the “ tug of war between earnings and valuations ” While corporate earnings are expected to grow 15 % by 2026 the high PE ratio of 28 could be at risk of contracting . If valuations revert the overall market gain for the year might end up being only around 5 % . Given that tech stocks now make up almost 50 % of the index VOO itself is basically half an “ AI fund . With this expectation of “ slower growth ” I ’ m thinking of adjusting my approach a bit . I don ’ t want to sell all my individual stocks but I am planning to move some of my profits into VOO . I ’ ve noticed a lot of people talking about “ rotating into VOO ” lately . What are your real reasons for doing so Is it mainly fear of volatility in individual stocks at these highs or are you also less optimistic about getting outsized returns going forward"

By Q4 2026: BEARISH: * Carvana (CVNA) goes from $440 → $150 BULLISH: * Celsius (CELH) goes from $45 → $80 Two very different directions. **CVNA:** This thing has been resurrected from the dead already. Massive short squeeze, insane multiple expansion, hype + momentum carrying it way past fundamentals. But at some point, margins, debt, used car demand normalization, competition growing will show. On top of that, Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations!!!!!! a lot of people seem to ignore. Their report claims Carvana’s turnaround optics may be overstated, pointing to aggressive accounting, related-party transactions, and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering. Again, these are *allegations*, not proven facts, but they raise real questions about how “clean” the recovery actually is. If growth slows even a little, or if scrutiny increases, CVNA will not get a soft landing. CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS. It was about to go for BK in 2023. not financial advice **CELH:** On the flip side, CELH feels like a long-term consumer brand compounding story. Distribution keeps expanding, international runway is huge, margins improving, and it’s actually profitable. Expect some volatility. $80 by 2026 isn’t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda. They are also marketing towards healthy energy, as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu. There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper. Just buy, compound, and watch it grow. This should overtake Monster in the future.",

By Q4 2026 BEARISH Carvana CVNA goes from $ 440 → $ 150 BULLISH Celsius CELH goes from $ 45 → $ 80 Two very different directions . CVNA This thing has been resurrected from the dead already . Massive short squeeze insane multiple expansion hype momentum carrying it way past fundamentals . But at some point margins debt used car demand normalization competition growing will show . On top of that Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations a lot of people seem to ignore . Their report claims Carvana ’ s turnaround optics may be overstated pointing to aggressive accounting relatedparty transactions and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering . Again these are allegations not_proven facts but they raise real questions about how “ clean ” the recovery actually is . If growth slows even a little or if scrutiny increases CVNA will not_get a soft landing . CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS . It was about to go for BK in 2023. not_financial advice CELH On the flip side CELH feels like a longterm consumer brand compounding story . Distribution keeps expanding international runway is huge margins improving and it ’ s actually profitable . Expect some volatility . $ 80 by 2026 isn ’ t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda . They are also marketing towards healthy energy as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu . There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper . Just buy compound and watch it grow . This should overtake Monster in the future ."

      "title": "Why I Think HIMS Is Undervalued ?",
      "selftext": "I valued Hims [6 months ago at \\~$34/share.]( Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a low-margin business, subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend, that their fastest growing vertical (GLP-1 meds) faced regulatory hurdles, and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space. I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results, and I actually think it's undervalued by about 20%. Here's why my view has changed. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Hims was operating on razor-thin margins (6.5%) at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse. Based on their latest 10-Q it now sits at 2%. They've invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility ($39M), purchased a lab ($5M), expanded their compounding facility, and signed leases for new warehouse facilities - all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line. In addition, subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP-1 customers has intensified. So what's the justification for the upward revaluation: * Subscriber Growth: 2025 was tough for Hims - the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list, their partnership with Lilly ran afoul, and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums. For context, they added \\~700K new subscribers in 2024, and this year they're on track to add \\~480K new subscribers. In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs, Hims will end 2025 with \\~2.7M paying subscribers. * CAC Paybacks: While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space, Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs. For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longer-term plans (6+ months) with tiered pricing. With a payback period of less than a year, those higher acquisition costs are actually justified. * Master Marketers: Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with near-perfect execution on the marketing front - this was true from the early days of the company and they've maintained that edge ever since. They've established a strong brand presence, are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing. In addition they've been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy. Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb, the site attracts \\~100M visits annually. * Diversified Offering: Hims' stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical - GLP-1 meds. But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering. In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health, mental health, derm conditions, and of late have expanded into lab testing. And on the weight management front, they've restarted their compounded semaglutide offering (the Novo drug) through 503A pharmacies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide (the Lilly med) using the same strategy. Here's how I think things will shake out: * They'll cross $2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to \\~$18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of \\~23%. * They'll pare back their marketing expenses over time (currently at \\~40% of overall revenue) as the company matures and brand awareness builds. And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run, in the long run their margins will improve to \\~12% as operating leverage kicks in. * They have \\~248M shares outstanding (including options and RSUs). One thing to note: they've convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $70 by 2030. I haven't included these in my overall share count since I'm treating the $1B as debt. * Removing debt, adding back cash, their equity is worth \\~$10.7B. Wrapping it all up: Based on my estimates the stock is worth \\~$42/share and is currently undervalued by \\~20% at $34. Let me know what all of you think - would love to hear your thoughts!

      "selftext_processed": "I valued Hims 6 months ago at $ 34share . Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a lowmargin business subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend that their fastest growing vertical GLP1 meds faced regulatory hurdles and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space . I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results and I actually think its undervalued by about 20 % . Heres why my view has changed . Lets get the bad news out of the way first . Hims was operating on razorthin margins 6.5 % at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse . Based on their latest 10Q it now sits at 2 % . Theyve invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility $ 39M purchased a lab $ 5M expanded their compounding facility and signed leases for new warehouse facilities all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line . In addition subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP1 customers has intensified . So whats the justification for the upward revaluation Subscriber Growth 2025 was tough for Hims the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list their partnership with Lilly ran afoul and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums . For context they added 700K new subscribers in 2024 and this year theyre on track to add 480K new subscribers . In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs Hims will end 2025 with 2.7M paying subscribers . CAC Paybacks While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs . For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longerterm plans 6 months with tiered pricing . With a payback period of less than a year those higher acquisition costs are actually justified . Master Marketers Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with nearperfect execution on the marketing front this was true from the early days of the company and theyve maintained that edge ever since . Theyve established a strong brand presence are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing . In addition theyve been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy . Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb the site attracts 100M visits annually . Diversified Offering Hims stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical GLP1 meds . But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering . In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health mental health derm conditions and of late have expanded into lab testing . And on the weight management front theyve restarted their compounded semaglutide offering the Novo drug through 503A pharmacies and I wouldnt be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide the Lilly med using the same strategy . Heres how I think things will shake out Theyll cross $ 2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to $ 18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of 23 % . Theyll pare back their marketing expenses over time currently at 40 % of overall revenue as the company matures and brand awareness builds . And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run in the long run their margins will improve to 12 % as operating leverage kicks in . They have 248M shares outstanding including options and RSUs . One thing to note theyve convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $ 70 by 2030 . I havent included these in my overall share count since Im treating the $ 1B as debt . Removing debt adding back cash their equity is worth $ 10.7B . Wrapping it all up Based on my estimates the stock is worth $ 42share and is currently undervalued by 20 % at $ 34 . Let me know what all of you think would love to hear your thoughts submitsource_idt3_1pvm12n"

      "selftext": "South Korean memory manufacturers Samsung (SSNLF) and SK Hynix have reportedly raised prices for their fifth generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) chips by 20%, with deliveries expected in 2026. The HBM3E price hike comes amid surging demand for advanced memory chips driven by the rise of AI applications. This surge occurs as memory manufacturers prepare to shift resources toward HBM4 chips typically when prices for the previous generation begin to weaken. NVIDIA (NVDA), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have all increased memory requirements for new AI chips. I plan to use $500,000 to steadily increase holdings in Samsung and Nvidia, aiming to complete this plan by January 2026. Do you think holding these positions for 2-3 years could double my investment?",

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future . I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future . For example VEQT XEQT ZEQT have a Canada bias . While FLIN is well established with $ 2.85B in AUM IND is brand new only started in Nov 2025 with AUM of only $ 4.97M . Both have same MER 0.19 % . I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 diversity of underlying stocks . However the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high . It is also from a company I have never_heard of . The MER on INDA is much higher at 0.62 % . And the Canadian XID MER is insane at 0.99 % . FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND . However is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment"

      "selftext": "Back in early June, I came across MU through a stock screener and started keeping an eye on the company. By mid-June, I noticed the stock was on a consistent upward trend, so I dove deeper into my research. Based on my findings, I made the decision to start building a position around $113. Fast forward to today, and my MU holdings now account for 40% of my portfolio. After Christmas, the stock rose another 10 points, reaching an impressive $287. This is the most money I’ve made in a stock, and honestly, it’s the best Christmas gift I could’ve asked for. Now, I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep adding to my position and maintain the high-risk, high-reward strategy, or do I start taking some profits off the table and reduce my exposure to lock in these gains? Do you think Micron’s future potential can keep this momentum going, or is the stock price approaching a temporary peak?",

      "selftext": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS, but are they really a great investment when they're priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader? Why space stocks will struggle in 2026: 1. Space business requires a ton of capital, that means constant dilution. Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS, just to start generating revenue. 2. Space will always have very high \"cost of revenue\" associated with it, will always have high R&D, and G&A, yet they're priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low R&Ds and G&As. 3. Space is dangerous, one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight. For instance, ASTS has to launch 100+ satellites (they launched 1 in all of 2025) and one setback and they're immediately months behind schedule. There's a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks. 4. Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepest-pocketed billionaire in the world. SpaceX just spent $20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS. SpaceX is also about 3-5 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets. 5. Both companies are still playing catch-up to SpaceX. In the case of ASTS, they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future. 6. SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest, why own a second-fiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader? Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA? I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd. RKLB trading at 70 Price-to-Sales ratio. ASTS is still a per-revenue company yet it's valued at close to $30 billion!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS but are they really a great investment when theyre priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader Why space stocks will struggle in 2026 1 . Space business requires a ton of capital that means constant dilution . Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS just to start generating revenue . 2 . Space will always have very high cost of revenue associated with it will always have high RD and GA yet theyre priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low RDs and GAs . 3 . Space is dangerous one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight . For instance ASTS has to launch 100 satellites they launched 1 in all of 2025 and one setback and theyre immediately months behind schedule . Theres a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks . 4 . Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepestpocketed billionaire in the world . SpaceX just spent $ 20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS . SpaceX is also about 35 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets . 5 . Both companies are still playing catchup to SpaceX . In the case of ASTS they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future . 6 . SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest why own a secondfiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd . RKLB trading at 70 PricetoSales ratio . ASTS is still a perrevenue company yet its valued at close to $ 30 billion"

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

It’s the first publicly listed LiDAR company to turn a profit, which is why I like its fundamentals and position in the industry. At the time, the stock was trending down and even dipped to around $15 before bouncing. I decided to start a position in early December at about $19, mainly based on my long-term view of the business, not short-term price action. Curious how you guys see Hesai at this stage what do you think are the main opportunities and risks here? And does the current price still make sense for a medium- to long-term hold?",

It ’ s the first publicly listed LiDAR company to turn a profit which is why I like its fundamentals and position in the industry . At the time the stock was trending down and even dipped to around $ 15 before bouncing . I decided to start a position in early December at about $ 19 mainly based on my longterm view of the business not_shortterm price action . Curious how you guys see Hesai at this stage what do you think are the main opportunities and risks here And does the current price still make sense for a medium to longterm hold"

      "title": "Risks for Venture Global stock",
      "selftext": "Based on 3Q earnings, Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030. Additionally, they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already. These agreements are mostly long-term supply and purchase agreements (SPAs) lasting a duration of 20 years. LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades, primarily in Asia, due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies, coal-to-gas switching and decarbonization, and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption. My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs, priced at around US$5-7/mmbtu. Hence, this serves as a source of long-term stable revenues. Of course, the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals. Additionally, it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP, who are some of the off-takers of its LNG cargoes. They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP. Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war. I am unsure of what is the long-term impact of these legal battles, but I think it should not affect the long-term business case. I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity. The LNG market seems to be growing healthily. As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects, I would think that the stock price can easily hit 15-18 dollars within the next 1-2 years. I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis?",

      "selftext_processed": "Based on 3Q earnings Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030 . Additionally they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already . These agreements are mostly longterm supply and purchase agreements SPAs lasting a duration of 20 years . LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades primarily in Asia due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies coaltogas switching and decarbonization and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption . My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs priced at around US $ 57mmbtu . Hence this serves as a source of longterm stable revenues . Of course the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals . Additionally it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP who are some of the offtakers of its LNG cargoes . They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP . Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not_abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the RussiaUkraine war . I am unsure of what is the longterm impact of these legal battles but I think it should not_affect the longterm business case . I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $ VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity . The LNG market seems to be growing healthily . As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects I would think that the stock price can easily hit 1518 dollars within the next 12 years . I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis"

      "selftext": "As we all know, MU has been doing exceptionally well this last year and the outlook so far is only up. I've kept almost all of my RSU's and ESPP that I've gotten from MU for the last year or two and needless to say it's grown significantly in size and now I'm not sure what to do with them. Option 1 is just keep them all and ride the wave for as long as I can, but historically MU is very cyclical and when it goes down, it goes down hard. The AI revolution helps with this, but it isn't a cure. Option 2 is sell and diversify into other stuff. Outside of this I follow a typical boglehead strategy and it's worked well for me. I would only sell RSUs first and wait until ESPPs become long term for tax advantages (\\~6 months for 1 group, 1 year for another). My holdup is since MU has done so well over the last year, keeping until the new fab(s) come online could have some insane gains that I don't want to miss out on. On the other hand, selling and diversifying gets me all the compounded gains up until the same point, it's a question of which one is likely to make more. I suppose option 3 could be to sell half and keep half to get a piece of both cakes? Not sure, looking for some advice. Thanks.",

So I was wondering do you have a plan written down or what would you suggest relatively new investors to do . Have you found any useful resources that helped"

      "title": "POET - An engineer's perspective",
      "selftext": "I kept seeing $POET floated around as a potential big play. Having not known anything about the company, I decided to do some personal due diligence. A little about my background. I am a mechanical engineering PhD with a specialization in robotics and artificial intelligence. I am the co-founder of a company launching it's first product in 2026 as well as an adjunct professor at a university occasionally. TL;DR - $POET could pull off a huge win and dominate the market, but I think the headwinds are too strong and it's more likely they run out of confidence and money before they get there. I am staying away. The risk does not warrant the payoff. First, let's break down their technology. Copper is frequently used for data transmission. It's cheap, it's easy to work with, and it's rugged. However, it's slow. To get around this, technologies like fiberoptics have emerged which send data at the theoretical maximum - the speed of light. Fiberoptics are great for long distances (like across an ocean) because the bulky equipment can be hosed on the ends of the run. However, the LASERs and lenses can't really fit on a chip for shark scale fast data transport. $POET wants to shrink this down by essentially making a shoe for the interconnect to get fast data transfer at small scale. This technology isn't particularly new, but it's been held back by manufacturing and this is where my personal expertise is putting up massive red flags. This is where I'll get into the critical details. My company I co-founded is in the high technology ceramics field which has a lot of similarities to what $POET is trying to pull off. $POET's big problem isn't the usefulness of its technology (it works and it would be a game changer), the problem is manufacturing yields and this is the same problem ceramics face. Both the core part I make and $POET's part relies heavily on manufacturing yields. Unlike traditional manufacturing which have ductile materials which can be shaped and manipulated after manufacturing to pass QA, ceramics and microelectronics have to be made in one shot and the result is binary - either it passes QA or it fails. Anyone who has made a pot in high school or something has probably experienced this. The clay pot goes into the kiln and it can come out cracked or broken. You're essentially gambling each time you make a part and your goal is to make the odds in your favor. You want the probability of success as high as possible (95+% success rate) out the failed parts cost so much that you can't make money on the good parts. To make matters worse, $POET cannot directly test each part to ensure it's passed QA. At my company we can't either and it's a real challenge. The way to handle this challenge is to use statistical process control (SPC) to get your yields high and stable. You make thousands of parts and test enough of them that you can be confident your yield numbers are what you think they are. As an example, say your manufacturing process has a yield rate of 70% (a number so low you can't be profitable) and you process 10 parts. It's very possible you get lucky and 9 out of 10 parts come out good. Now it feels like you have a yield of 90%, but the reality is you got lucky and you wouldn't see the 70% until you made 1,000 parts. Now you have false confidence and you push forward only for it to blow up in your face. The only way to make sure your yields are where you think your are is to make thousands of parts and that can burn cash very, very quickly. So that's a huge barrier for $POET, but expected in this industry. However, this isn't the biggest red flag to me. The biggest red flag is the fact $POET is not doing the manufacturing themselves! They have taken the most critical challenge they faced and pushed it onto other fab companies in hopes they can figure it out. They don't control their process! And if one of their partners do manage to figure it out (very difficult, but let's take the optimistic case) then this supplier has HUGE leverage over $POET because they are the only supplier. The partner could start jacking up the price on $POET because they're the only option they have. At my company, we've done manufacturing in house. We believe in our technology and our ability to execute. We control our destiny. $POET does not control their destiny and the fact they are not trying to do this in house tells me they do not have the expertise or confidence in themselves to solve the critical problems. They're hoping they can hype people up with some demonstrations of working parts before the bottom falls out and everyone learns they can make the parts cheap enough. I have considered puts here, but they could hype people up enough in the short term to send the stock sky high before crashing down to reality. I think the best play here is to stay away. You have better odds in Vegas.",

      "selftext_processed": "I kept seeing $ POET floated around as a potential big play . Having not_known anything about the company I decided to do some personal due diligence . A little about my background . I am a mechanical engineering PhD with a specialization in robotics and artificial intelligence . I am the cofounder of a company launching its first product in 2026 as well as an adjunct professor at a university occasionally . TLDR $ POET could pull off a huge win and dominate the market but I think the headwinds are too strong and its more likely they run out of confidence and money before they get there . I am staying away . The risk does not_warrant the payoff . First lets break down their technology . Copper is frequently used for data transmission . Its cheap its easy to work with and its rugged . However its slow . To get around this technologies like fiberoptics have emerged which send data at the theoretical maximum the speed of light . Fiberoptics are great for long distances like across an ocean because the bulky equipment can be hosed on the ends of the run . However the LASERs and lenses cant really fit on a chip for shark scale fast data transport . $ POET wants to shrink this down by essentially making a shoe for the interconnect to get fast data transfer at small scale . This technology isnt particularly new but its been held back by manufacturing and this is where my personal expertise is putting up massive red flags . This is where Ill get into the critical details . My company I cofounded is in the high technology ceramics field which has a lot of similarities to what $ POET is trying to pull off . $ POETs big problem isnt the usefulness of its technology it works and it would be a game changer the problem is manufacturing yields and this is the same problem ceramics face . Both the core part I make and $ POETs part relies heavily on manufacturing yields . Unlike traditional manufacturing which have ductile materials which can be shaped and manipulated after manufacturing to pass QA ceramics and microelectronics have to be made in one shot and the result is binary either it passes QA or it fails . Anyone who has made a pot in high school or something has probably experienced this . The clay pot goes into the kiln and it can come out cracked or broken . Youre essentially gambling each time you make a part and your goal is to make the odds in your favor . You want the probability of success as high as possible 95 % success rate out the failed parts cost so much that you cant make money on the good parts . To make matters worse $ POET can not directly test each part to ensure its passed QA . At my company we cant either and its a real challenge . The way to handle this challenge is to use statistical process control SPC to get your yields high and stable . You make thousands of parts and test enough of them that you can be confident your yield numbers are what you think they are . As an example say your manufacturing process has a yield rate of 70 % a number so low you cant be profitable and you process 10 parts . Its very possible you get lucky and 9 out of 10 parts come out good . Now it feels like you have a yield of 90 % but the reality is you got lucky and you wouldnt see the 70 % until you made 1000 parts . Now you have false confidence and you push forward only for it to blow up in your face . The only way to make sure your yields are where you think your are is to make thousands of parts and that can burn cash very very quickly . So thats a huge barrier for $ POET but expected in this industry . However this isnt the biggest red flag to me . The biggest red flag is the fact $ POET is not_doing the manufacturing themselves They have taken the most critical challenge they faced and pushed it onto other fab companies in hopes they can figure it out . They dont control their process And if one of their partners do manage to figure it out very difficult but lets take the optimistic case then this supplier has HUGE leverage over $ POET because they are the only supplier . The partner could start jacking up the price on $ POET because theyre the only option they have . At my company weve done manufacturing in house . We believe in our technology and our ability to execute . We control our destiny . $ POET does not_control their destiny and the fact they are not_trying to do this in house tells me they do not_have the expertise or confidence in themselves to solve the critical problems . Theyre hoping they can hype people up with some demonstrations of working parts before the bottom falls out and everyone learns they can make the parts cheap enough . I have considered puts here but they could hype people up enough in the short term to send the stock sky high before crashing down to reality . I think the best play here is to stay away . You have better odds in Vegas ."

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic . FINVIZ for fundamental data charts and aggregated news Earnings Whisper for earnings details See our past daily discussions here .

(even if i get avg warren buffet returns annually ) i cant make it really big. Then suddenly a thought striked. Instead of me getting to play within rules and boundries. i find small market size **company leaders** who wanna play safe but with realistic plans and once they cross the threshold and gets some billionare eye they will push it to the roof. The whole idea is to get them first before any big shark can. That way you can be relaxed that your money is handed over to the guy like you. and will eventually see enormous gains. remember company rally behind a confident man with realistic plans and then market rallys behind it. Question comes how will you judge them? simple. Same as you find your favorite youtuber to be factually correct and ethical.",

Then suddenly a thought striked . Instead of me getting to play within rules and boundries . i find small market size company leaders who wan na play safe but with realistic plans and once they cross the threshold and gets some billionare eye they will push it to the roof . The whole idea is to get them first before any big shark can . That way you can be relaxed that your money is handed over to the guy like you . and will eventually see enormous gains . remember company rally behind a confident man with realistic plans and then market rallys behind it . Question comes how will you judge them simple . Same as you find your favorite youtuber to be factually correct and ethical ."

      "selftext": "Hello, I'm from an eastern country in Europe. Back in 2007, the medium wage was around 200 euro, now it's 1100 euro. If I would have invested a sum in 2007, in something like S&P 500, the inflation would have left me with around twice the buying power of what I put in, compared to 4 times for Americans. This, all the while euro and dollar exchange was kept pretty stable. Only 5-7 % variation. Real estate prices have also skyrocketed. Went from 700 euro per sqm in 2012, to around 2000 now. People keep talking about a collapse since 2020, but nothing happened yet. Although it could happen any time. In 2005 we had the same prices as in 2012, went up to 1500 during the 2008 financial crisis, then down and slowly climbed up again. If the trend continues in the future, I don't think it's a good idea to invest in a world wide index fund that only yields 6-8 %. I'm really new to this and I don't understand what would be a good solution.",

If I would have invested a sum in 2007 in something like SP 500 the inflation would have left me with around twice the buying power of what I put in compared to 4 times for Americans . This all the while euro and dollar exchange was kept pretty stable . Only 57 % variation . Real estate prices have also skyrocketed . Went from 700 euro per sqm in 2012 to around 2000 now . People keep talking about a collapse since 2020 but nothing_happened yet . Although it could happen any time . In 2005 we had the same prices as in 2012 went up to 1500 during the 2008 financial crisis then down and slowly climbed up again . If the trend continues in the future I dont think its a good idea to invest in a world wide index fund that only yields 68 % . Im really new to this and I dont understand what would be a good solution ."

      "title": "HIMS Might be Undervalued by ~ 20%?",
      "selftext": "I valued Hims [6 months ago at \\~$34/share.]( Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a low-margin business, subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend, that their fastest growing vertical (GLP-1 meds) faced regulatory hurdles, and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space. I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results, and I actually think it's undervalued by about 20%. Here's why my view has changed. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Hims was operating on razor-thin margins (6.5%) at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse. Based on their latest 10-Q it now sits at 2%. They've invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility ($39M), purchased a lab ($5M), expanded their compounding facility, and signed leases for new warehouse facilities - all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line. In addition, subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP-1 customers has intensified. So what's the justification for the upward revaluation: * Subscriber Growth: 2025 was tough for Hims - the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list, their partnership with Lilly ran afoul, and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums. For context, they added \\~700K new subscribers in 2024, and this year they're on track to add \\~480K new subscribers. In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs, Hims will end 2025 with \\~2.7M paying subscribers. * CAC Paybacks: While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space, Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs. For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longer-term plans (6+ months) with tiered pricing. With a payback period of less than a year, those higher acquisition costs are actually justified. * Master Marketers: Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with near-perfect execution on the marketing front - this was true from the early days of the company and they've maintained that edge ever since. They've established a strong brand presence, are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing. In addition they've been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy. Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb, the site attracts \\~100M visits annually. * Diversified Offering: Hims' stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical - GLP-1 meds. But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering. In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health, mental health, derm conditions, and of late have expanded into lab testing. And on the weight management front, they've restarted their compounded semaglutide offering (the Novo drug) through 503A pharmacies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide (the Lilly med) using the same strategy. Here's how I think things will shake out: * They'll cross $2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to \\~$18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of \\~23%. * They'll pare back their marketing expenses over time (currently at \\~40% of overall revenue) as the company matures and brand awareness builds. And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run, in the long run their margins will improve to \\~12% as operating leverage kicks in. * They have \\~248M shares outstanding (including options and RSUs). One thing to note: they've convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $70 by 2030. I haven't included these in my overall share count since I'm treating the $1B as debt. * Removing debt, adding back cash, their equity is worth \\~$10.7B. Wrapping it all up: Based on my estimates the stock is worth \\~$42/share and is currently undervalued by \\~20% at $34. Let me know what all of you think - would love to hear your thoughts!",

      "selftext_processed": "I valued Hims 6 months ago at $ 34share . Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a lowmargin business subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend that their fastest growing vertical GLP1 meds faced regulatory hurdles and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space . I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results and I actually think its undervalued by about 20 % . Heres why my view has changed . Lets get the bad news out of the way first . Hims was operating on razorthin margins 6.5 % at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse . Based on their latest 10Q it now sits at 2 % . Theyve invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility $ 39M purchased a lab $ 5M expanded their compounding facility and signed leases for new warehouse facilities all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line . In addition subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP1 customers has intensified . So whats the justification for the upward revaluation Subscriber Growth 2025 was tough for Hims the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list their partnership with Lilly ran afoul and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums . For context they added 700K new subscribers in 2024 and this year theyre on track to add 480K new subscribers . In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs Hims will end 2025 with 2.7M paying subscribers . CAC Paybacks While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs . For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longerterm plans 6 months with tiered pricing . With a payback period of less than a year those higher acquisition costs are actually justified . Master Marketers Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with nearperfect execution on the marketing front this was true from the early days of the company and theyve maintained that edge ever since . Theyve established a strong brand presence are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing . In addition theyve been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy . Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb the site attracts 100M visits annually . Diversified Offering Hims stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical GLP1 meds . But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering . In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health mental health derm conditions and of late have expanded into lab testing . And on the weight management front theyve restarted their compounded semaglutide offering the Novo drug through 503A pharmacies and I wouldnt be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide the Lilly med using the same strategy . Heres how I think things will shake out Theyll cross $ 2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to $ 18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of 23 % . Theyll pare back their marketing expenses over time currently at 40 % of overall revenue as the company matures and brand awareness builds . And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run in the long run their margins will improve to 12 % as operating leverage kicks in . They have 248M shares outstanding including options and RSUs . One thing to note theyve convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $ 70 by 2030 . I havent included these in my overall share count since Im treating the $ 1B as debt . Removing debt adding back cash their equity is worth $ 10.7B . Wrapping it all up Based on my estimates the stock is worth $ 42share and is currently undervalued by 20 % at $ 34 . Let me know what all of you think would love to hear your thoughts"

      "title": "Strategy behind Nvidia’s Groq deal",
      "selftext": "Nvidia paid $20 billion in the Groq deal to secure exclusive access to Groq’s AI inference technology and talent with the aim of dominating the rapidly growing market for real-time AI processing. Nvidia licensed Groq’s Language Processing Unit (LPU) tech which is custom AI inference chips optimized for ultra-low latency and high throughput. What is the strategy? Nvidia brought in Groq’s founder Jonathan Ross (ex-Google TPU architect), President Sunny Madra, and other key engineers to integrate and scale the tech internally within Nvidia. Nvidia is highly focused on AI training through their GPUs, but Groq excels in inference which runs trained models in real time. This deal strengthens Nvidia’s position across the full AI pipeline with AI inference market expansion. Groq was a rising competitor. Nvidia’s move preemptively neutralizes a competitive threat while avoiding a full acquisition that might trigger regulatory scrutiny. The deal is structured as a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a full acquisition, as it allows Groq to remain independent while Nvidia gains the core IP and talent. Why pay a high valuation? Groq’s LPUs are already production ready and outperform traditional GPUs in specific inference tasks so speed to market was likely a factor Nvidia valued. By structuring the deal as a licensing + talent acquisition, Nvidia avoids antitrust hurdles that a full acquisition might trigger. Nvidia had over $60B in cash and short term investments so this deal was a bold but affordable bet on future AI dominance. What happens to Groq? Groq remains an independent company, now led by new CEO Simon Edwards. Its cloud platform, GroqCloud, continues operating separately. Nvidia gains the tech and team, but not the full company. This deal is a textbook example of a “strategic acqui-hire plus IP licensing” move.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia paid $ 20 billion in the Groq deal to secure exclusive access to Groq ’ s AI inference technology and talent with the aim of dominating the rapidly growing market for realtime AI processing . Nvidia licensed Groq ’ s Language Processing Unit LPU tech which is custom AI inference chips optimized for ultralow latency and high throughput . What is the strategy Nvidia brought in Groq ’ s founder Jonathan Ross exGoogle TPU architect President Sunny Madra and other key engineers to integrate and scale the tech internally within Nvidia . Nvidia is highly focused on AI training through their GPUs but Groq excels in inference which runs trained models in real time . This deal strengthens Nvidia ’ s position across the full AI pipeline with AI inference market expansion . Groq was a rising competitor . Nvidia ’ s move preemptively neutralizes a competitive threat while avoiding a full acquisition that might trigger regulatory scrutiny . The deal is structured as a nonexclusive licensing agreement rather than a full acquisition as it allows Groq to remain independent while Nvidia gains the core IP and talent . Why pay a high valuation Groq ’ s LPUs are already production ready and outperform traditional GPUs in specific inference tasks so speed to market was likely a factor Nvidia valued . By structuring the deal as a licensing talent acquisition Nvidia avoids antitrust hurdles that a full acquisition might trigger . Nvidia had over $ 60B in cash and short term investments so this deal was a bold but affordable bet on future AI dominance . What happens to Groq Groq remains an independent company now led by new CEO Simon Edwards . Its cloud platform GroqCloud continues operating separately . Nvidia gains the tech and team but not_the full company . This deal is a textbook example of a “ strategic acquihire plus IP licensing ” move ."

      "selftext": "Alright, regards, if you had been following my last DD on META, you would’ve done really well. Since that DD post, my position has been up moderately + I’ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call (I bought back when I’m up 50% and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility). I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits. TLDR: Fundamentally: Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation. BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream (around 2021 to present). I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then. Macro/Policy: The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer. Bullish for commodities. Thesis: Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn’t over yet. Short/Medium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 (according to scott bessent). DD starts here: I’m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas. ETH, some people call it digital silver, some people call it the backbone of Wall Street, some people call it a scam (I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it). Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade, and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately, while others are still amazed at his haircut. All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue - is Ethereum worth anything, or is it just fairy dust? In my DD, I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won’t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium. **What is value?** The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield. Which is why we can value a stock, because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric, gold/silver/BTC/ETH are all the same - they have no intrinsic value as they don’t earn you any money just by holding them. Which leads us to the next question: why are gold and silver doing so well, while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage? **What is price? How are commodities priced?** There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity. The most common factors include: utility, scarcity, trust/credibility, cost to carry, supply and demand, and most importantly market sentiment (mass psychology). For gold and silver specifically, they have limited in supply (on earth) and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not only as commodities but also as currencies. In terms of utility, Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below. However, if you just look at supply vs demand, you would realized they are not off by much and it’s not really the driver for gold price (same for silver). **What is the real driver for price?** As mentioned earlier, gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not just as commodities, but as currencies. So much so that they are considered risk-off assets (or save haven when shit hits the fan). Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks. In other words, gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver. (as shown in chart below) Like the stock market, gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply (aka inflation). On top of that, gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens. Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety. **What about BTC and ETH?** There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver. For example, BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world’s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain (similar to gold, it became a much more volatile version of store of value). And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets (sounds like silver when it comes to utility). The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024. While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions, ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets. So far, 65% of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant, the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030. So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network. While it sounded like a greenflag on paper, I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag. ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH (as projection chart shows below, the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years + ETH gives a dividend), I find this to be shady and don’t really buy it. On top of that, I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price. But if the supply projection holds true, ETH will be much closer to the digital silver. Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies, the correlation between BTC/ETH and M2 says it all. Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021. And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period. So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset? This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal, a FinTech strategist at Autonomous. Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed. In the early years, crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money, so it was less correlated with equities. After COVID, easier access through exchanges, large retail participation, and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios. As a result, BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite, which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold. This does not mean BTC and ETH will always trade like high-beta stocks. As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and long-term holders, their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints, network usage, and monetary demand rather than short-term liquidity cycles. Over time, this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities, where value is tied to money supply, instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment. **The Inflationary Policy & Macro effects** Trump has taken extensive measures (manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed) to keep the USD weak and interest rate low (to maintain export advantage + service the 38 trillion debt) despite high level of inflation. The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury (kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world). The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market. Which could be inflationary. **Short Term Catalyst for ETH: Tokenization** In 2025, the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones, including: * SEC roundtables on tokenization; platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US. * BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs; industry leaders predict massive market growth. * Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026; Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street. And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption. CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network: To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization, the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below. So far, 90% of tokenized assets are stable coin (which ETH dominates) and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network **So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end?** Since late October, the stock market has been choppy rather than trending. Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened, which caused systematic investors like CTAs and vol-targeting funds to reduce exposure. In this environment, BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds, not because of panic, but because risk appetite never fully returned. Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious. So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown. The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into year-end, which suggests sentiment is still intact. Most notably, the AI sector has remained strong. Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding, showing that growth expectations have not collapsed. As equity volatility compresses and risk-on sentiment improves, this gives the market room to grind higher. If that happens, liquidity and positioning should rotate back into high-beta assets, which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026. Looking at the ETH chart, the day candle is showing stabilization and I don’t see why it wouldn’t revisit ATH and break above $5,250 in Q1 2026. **My expression for this bet: BMNR (I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4% at the time of purchase)** As I think ETH could re-visit 5k in Q1 2026, BMNR is the perfect pick. I pick it for 3 reasons: 1. No debt - so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR (which is also starting to price in not being included into S&P 500). 2. Premium to NAV expansion - if my thesis plays out, Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels: 1.3x - 1.5x (which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world). 3. I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear. (for reasons I mentioned earlier, the ETH network is doing great, far from a bear market - so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift). **Position**: I even bought for my TFSA:",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright regards if you had been following my last DD on META you would ’ ve done really well . Since that DD post my position has been up moderately I ’ ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call I bought back when I ’ m up 50 % and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility . I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits . TLDR Fundamentally Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation . BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream around 2021 to present . I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then . MacroPolicy The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer . Bullish for commodities . Thesis Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn ’ t over yet . ShortMedium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 according to scott bessent . DD starts here I ’ m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas . ETH some people call it digital silver some people call it the backbone of Wall Street some people call it a scam I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it . Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately while others are still amazed at his haircut . All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue is Ethereum worth anything or is it just fairy dust In my DD I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won ’ t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium . What is value The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield . Which is why we can value a stock because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric goldsilverBTCETH are all the same they have no_intrinsic value as they don ’ t earn you any money just by holding them . Which leads us to the next question why are gold and silver doing so well while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage What is price How are commodities priced There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity . The most common factors include utility scarcity trustcredibility cost to carry supply and demand and most importantly market sentiment mass psychology . For gold and silver specifically they have limited in supply on earth and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not_only as commodities but also as currencies . In terms of utility Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below . However if you just look at supply vs demand you would realized they are not_off by much and it ’ s not_really the driver for gold price same for silver . What is the real driver for price As mentioned earlier gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not_just as commodities but as currencies . So much so that they are considered riskoff assets or save haven when shit hits the fan . Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks . In other words gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver . as shown in chart below Like the stock market gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply aka inflation . On top of that gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens . Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety . What about BTC and ETH There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver . For example BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world ’ s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain similar to gold it became a much more volatile version of store of value . And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets sounds like silver when it comes to utility . The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024 . While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets . So far 65 % of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030 . So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network . While it sounded like a greenflag on paper I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag . ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH as projection chart shows below the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years ETH gives a dividend I find this to be shady and don ’ t really buy it . On top of that I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price . But if the supply projection holds true ETH will be much closer to the digital silver . Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies the correlation between BTCETH and M2 says it all . Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021 . And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period . So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal a FinTech strategist at Autonomous . Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed . In the early years crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money so it was less correlated with equities . After COVID easier access through exchanges large retail participation and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios . As a result BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold . This does not_mean BTC and ETH will always trade like highbeta stocks . As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and longterm holders their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints network usage and monetary demand rather than shortterm liquidity cycles . Over time this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities where value is tied to money supply instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment . The Inflationary Policy Macro effects Trump has taken extensive measures manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed to keep the USD weak and interest rate low to maintain export advantage service the 38 trillion debt despite high level of inflation . The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world . The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market . Which could be inflationary . Short Term Catalyst for ETH Tokenization In 2025 the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones including SEC roundtables on tokenization platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US . BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs industry leaders predict massive market growth . Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026 Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street . And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption . CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below . So far 90 % of tokenized assets are stable coin which ETH dominates and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end Since late October the stock market has been choppy rather than trending . Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened which caused systematic investors like CTAs and voltargeting funds to reduce exposure . In this environment BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds not_because of panic but because risk appetite never_fully returned . Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious . So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown . The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into yearend which suggests sentiment is still intact . Most notably the AI sector has remained strong . Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding showing that growth expectations have not_collapsed . As equity volatility compresses and riskon sentiment improves this gives the market room to grind higher . If that happens liquidity and positioning should rotate back into highbeta assets which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026 . Looking at the ETH chart the day candle is showing stabilization and I don ’ t see why it wouldn ’ t revisit ATH and break above $ 5250 in Q1 2026 . My expression for this bet BMNR I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4 % at the time of purchase As I think ETH could revisit 5k in Q1 2026 BMNR is the perfect pick . I pick it for 3 reasons 1 . No_debt so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR which is also starting to price in not_being included into SP 500 . 2 . Premium to NAV expansion if my thesis plays out Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels 1.3x 1.5x which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world . 3 . I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear . for reasons I mentioned earlier the ETH network is doing great far from a bear market so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift . Position I even bought for my TFSA"

      "selftext": "I'm currently investing in a Trading 212 Stocks ISA and likely to be able to max out for the next 6 years (£16k/year in Stocks ISA and £4k/year in Lifetime ISA). My current portfolio is at £34k: 66.9% VUAG at £22.8k 30.3% VWRP at £10.3k 2.7% Nvidia at £944 (not adding more) Going forward, I plan on just investing in VWRP. However, I keep seeing the argument from some finance creators (e.g. The FBA Investor) that \"ETFs won't make you rich\" and that with enough due diligence you can get higher long-term returns by concentrating into a smaller basket of individual stocks (holding for at least 5+ years). The criticism is that broad ETFs dilute exposure to the biggest winners and include many average companies which average to smaller returns. I understand the upside, but my concern is the probability of actually outperforming a simple global index over 10-30 years (and the risk of underperforming for long periods). 1. Is concentration in individual stocks a sensible way to optimise long-term returns? 2. Is my VUAG & VWRP split redundant - is it best to simplify to only VWRP? 3. Is a satellite approach reasonable and what percentage cap would you suggest for individual stocks (i.e. 10%)? I still plan to invest long-term by holding for at least 5 years.",

My current portfolio is at £34k 66.9 % VUAG at £22.8k 30.3 % VWRP at £10.3k 2.7 % Nvidia at £944 not adding more Going forward I plan on just investing in VWRP . However I keep seeing the argument from some finance creators e.g . The FBA Investor that ETFs wont make you rich and that with enough due diligence you can get higher longterm returns by concentrating into a smaller basket of individual stocks holding for at least 5 years . The criticism is that broad ETFs dilute exposure to the biggest winners and include many average companies which average to smaller returns . I understand the upside but my concern is the probability of actually outperforming a simple global index over 1030 years and the risk of underperforming for long periods . 1 . Is concentration in individual stocks a sensible way to optimise longterm returns 2 . Is my VUAG VWRP split redundant is it best to simplify to only VWRP 3 . Is a satellite approach reasonable and what percentage cap would you suggest for individual stocks i.e . 10 % I still plan to invest longterm by holding for at least 5 years ."

Can this extra loss be used in some other kind of deductions . And this is my first time doing this so please advise . Am I thinking straight . Is there a catch to any of this . I am also aware of wash sale and don ’ t plan to add these by next month ."

      "title": "The AI trade isn’t dying but the bottleneck may have quietly moved elsewhere",
      "selftext": "Over the last two years, AI has become *the* dominant investment narrative. Semiconductors, AI infrastructure, data centers the entire stack has attracted massive capital flows. Names like NVDA, TSM, and ASML turned into consensus longs, and for good reason: real revenue growth, real demand, real earnings power. But lately, I’ve been wondering whether the core constraint in this trade is still compute… or whether it has shifted to something far less exciting: **energy and grid infrastructure**. The scale of current AI investment plans is unprecedented. We’re no longer talking about incremental capex, but **$100B+ data center buildouts**, measured not just in dollars, but in *gigawatts*. At that level, chips are no longer the only bottleneck. Power availability, grid stability, and energy costs start to matter just as much. What’s interesting is that markets may already be reflecting this shift under the surface. AI hardware names have shown increasing volatility and sharp pullbacks after extended runs, while **utilities and power-related companies** have begun to quietly outperform. It’s not flashy, but it’s consistent with a market that’s starting to price the *next constraint* in the system. You can even see hints of this in trading behavior. On **Bitget** platforms , where both AI-heavy equities and energy-related names are actively traded in tokenized form, flows have become noticeably more two-sided. Instead of one-way momentum into AI, there’s growing interest in power generation, grid operators, and infrastructure-linked plays. This doesn’t mean the AI story is over. Far from it. AI adoption still looks structural, and companies like NVDA or TSM remain central beneficiaries over the long term. But markets don’t price stories in isolation they price constraints, risks, and second-order effects. And if energy and infrastructure become the limiting factors for AI expansion, capital allocation may gradually reflect that reality. So the question for long-term investors isn’t “AI or no AI,” but something more nuanced: * Do you stay heavily concentrated in AI infrastructure? * Do you start allocating toward utilities, power grids, and energy reliability? * Or do you balance both, accepting lower upside in exchange for resilience? Curious how others here are thinking about this shift, especially from a multi-year allocation perspective.",

De-risking Governance (Political Stability) * **Problem:** Investors fear regime change and expropriation (the \"Strongman\" risk). * **Solution:** A rigid constitutional lock (40 years) on property rights. * **Mechanism:** Executive power is hedged by a Bicameral Legislature where the Upper House represents national interests (Open List PR), preventing any single clan from capturing the state. A mandatory Run-off system forces centrist coalitions, reducing the risk of radical policy swings (e.g., sudden nationalization). # 2. Monetary Predictability[[1]( * **The Fed Model:** An independent Central Bank with a **Dual Mandate** (Price Stability + Employment). * **Currency:** A unified currency backed by a basket of commodities (Gold/Uranium reserves) to prevent FX volatility for foreign investors. * **Banking:** Implementation of **Glass-Steagall** separation. Commercial banks focus on lending to the real sector (CAPEX), minimizing systemic risk from speculative bubbles. Adoption of ISO 20022 standards for seamless cross-border settlement. # 3. Solving the \"Labor Shortage\" Risk (Human Capital) Developed markets (Korea, Japan) are facing demographic collapse, shrinking their consumer base. This model aims to create a sustainable labor pool. * **Demand-Side Stimulus:** State-backed infrastructure projects (High-speed rail, Logistics) ensure full employment. * **Wage Floor via Sectoral Bargaining:** Instead of a race-to-the-bottom, higher wages are encouraged to build a **robust middle class** capable of consuming imported goods and services. * **Result:** A growing demographic dividend (average age \\~28) with increasing purchasing power, contrasting with aging East Asian markets. # 4. Infrastructure as an Asset Class * The State acts as the primary developer of the \"Dry Suez\" logistics corridors connecting China and Europe. * This lowers logistics costs for private businesses entering the market. **The Question for** r/investing**:** From a risk/reward perspective, does this institutional setup (Checks and Balances + Demand-Side Stimulus) make the region a viable target for institutional capital? Or does the heavy state involvement in infrastructure crowd out private investment too much?",

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas: On part 1 you read how the current market is held up by flush consumer cash and money market. Part 2 you will see how it is more fragile than you think. Saving rates collapse: The K-Shaped recovery is turning into a K-Shaped exhaustion. ​Personal Saving Rate has fallen to 4.7% as of September 2025, with the 2025 year-to-date average sitting even lower at 4.4%. This is historically dangerous territory. In the 1970s, this rate averaged 11.7%. We are currently saving at less than half the rate of previous generations. ​Consumers are maintaining their lifestyle (retail sales growth) not by earning more, but by saving less. This is mathematically unsustainable. When the savings rate hits 0%, spending must contract. ​Credit Stress: While the aggregate credit card delinquency rate is ~3.0% (Sept 2025), specific pockets are flashing red. Serious delinquency rates in low-income zip codes have surged past 20% in 2025, a level of stress comparable to the 2008 crisis for that specific demographic. The bottom 50% of earners have burned through their pandemic savings and are now maxing out leverage to survive inflation. The \"average\" is fine, but the foundation is rotting. ​The Yield Curve Signal (10Y-2Y Spread): ​The 10Y-2Y Treasury spread is now positive, sitting at +0.68% as of December 19, 2025 (10Y at 4.16%, 2Y at 3.48%). ​The curve was inverted (negative) continuously from July 2022 to August 2024. ​ Historically, the recession doesn't start when the curve inverts; it starts when it un-inverts (snaps back to positive) as the market demands Fed cuts. We are currently in that \"snap back\" danger zone. We are in a bull market. However this bull is exhausted. It is a porcelain bull. Fragile. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3:",

      "selftext_processed": "Merry Christmas On part 1 you read how the current market is held up by flush consumer cash and money market . Part 2 you will see how it is more fragile than you think . Saving rates collapse The KShaped recovery is turning into a KShaped exhaustion . ​Personal Saving Rate has fallen to 4.7 % as of September 2025 with the 2025 yeartodate average sitting even lower at 4.4 % . This is historically dangerous territory . In the 1970s this rate averaged 11.7 % . We are currently saving at less than half the rate of previous generations . ​Consumers are maintaining their lifestyle retail sales growth not_by earning more but by saving less . This is mathematically unsustainable . When the savings rate hits 0 % spending must contract . ​Credit Stress While the aggregate credit card delinquency rate is 3.0 % Sept 2025 specific pockets are flashing red . Serious delinquency rates in lowincome zip codes have surged past 20 % in 2025 a level of stress comparable to the 2008 crisis for that specific demographic . The bottom 50 % of earners have burned through their pandemic savings and are now maxing out leverage to survive inflation . The average is fine but the foundation is rotting . ​The Yield Curve Signal 10Y2Y Spread ​The 10Y2Y Treasury spread is now positive sitting at 0.68 % as of December 19 2025 10Y at 4.16 % 2Y at 3.48 % . ​The curve was inverted negative continuously from July 2022 to August 2024 . ​ Historically the recession doesnt start when the curve inverts it starts when it uninverts snaps back to positive as the market demands Fed cuts . We are currently in that snap back danger zone . We are in a bull market . However this bull is exhausted . It is a porcelain bull . Fragile . Part 1 Part 2 Part 3"

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas. I’ve spent the last days in the office hiding from my family pulling specific data points from FRED (debt service, savings rates, yield curves) to stress-test the \"Soft Landing\" narrative. We are essentially in a \"Wile E. Coyote\" moment running off the cliff, but gravity hasn't kicked in yet because the momentum is so strong. Why the Crash Hasn't Happened: As of Q2 2025, the Household Debt Service Ratio sits at 11.2% of disposable income. This is historically low. For comparison, this ratio peaked at nearly 16% in late 2007 right before the Great Financial Crisis. Even during the \"normal\" years of 2010–2019, it averaged 12.1%. Despite the Fed raising rates, the average American is spending less of their income on debt payments today than they did a decade ago. This \"shield\" explains why higher rates haven't crushed consumption yet. Total Money Market Fund assets hit a record $7.67 Trillion for the week ending December 17, 2025. This is up 13.2% from one year ago ($6.77T). This is massive dry powder. Every time the market dips, this cash steps in to buy, creating a valuation floor that prevents a full capitulation.

      "selftext_processed": "Merry Christmas . I ’ ve spent the last days in the office hiding from my family pulling specific data points from FRED debt service savings rates yield curves to stresstest the Soft Landing narrative . We are essentially in a Wile E. Coyote moment running off the cliff but gravity hasnt kicked in yet because the momentum is so strong . Why the Crash Hasnt Happened As of Q2 2025 the Household Debt Service Ratio sits at 11.2 % of disposable income . This is historically low . For comparison this ratio peaked at nearly 16 % in late 2007 right before the Great Financial Crisis . Even during the normal years of 2010–2019 it averaged 12.1 % . Despite the Fed raising rates the average American is spending less of their income on debt payments today than they did a decade ago . This shield explains why higher rates havent crushed consumption yet . Total Money Market Fund assets hit a record $ 7.67 Trillion for the week ending December 17 2025 . This is up 13.2 % from one year ago $ 6.77T . This is massive dry powder . Every time the market dips this cash steps in to buy creating a valuation floor that prevents a full capitulation . Part 2 why the market is fragile"

      "selftext": "I feel like we're in for an incredibly volatile month in January. There are two major events that could have a huge impact on the market - Supreme Court ruling on IEEPA tariffs, and a potential second gov shutdown at the end of the month. I think the latter is much less likely to happen than the former. I mostly want to talk about the tariff situation. I feel like nobody is really talking about this and we are just kind of sleep walking into it... To be fair it is hard to predict how the market will react to the news and what will happen next. It seems very likely that the SC will rule against Trump here though. This will force the government to refund a massive amount of money, and will produce a lot of chaos and uncertainty. While it may seem bullish on paper for tariffs to be struck down, the reality is that Trump will find another avenue to proceed with. The net effect of this ruling would be that we essentially go back to square 1. We have to refund an enormous amount of money, and clarity on tariff policy just gets delayed even further. I think this is a situation where SC will rule against it because it isn't legal, but it is probably not in the best interest of your average citizen for them to do so. I say this not because I believe in tariffs, I'm saying this because I feel the chaos that will ensue is going to be detrimental to the country at the end of the day. But thats beside the point. I'm mostly interested in how you guys think markets will react. I don't see this as a particularly bullish event even though it may seem that way. Again I think the actual effect of this decision will be greater lack of clarity on policy, and this is not a positive for markets or the economy. There might be specific winners and losers that you can pick out, interested to hear your thoughts. I think this should be a bigger concern than it is. I feel like nobody is talking about this right now and I think it could move the market pretty significantly. I think January is going to be a VERY volatile month.",

There are two major events that could have a huge impact on the market Supreme Court ruling on IEEPA tariffs and a potential second gov shutdown at the end of the month . I think the latter is much less likely to happen than the former . I mostly want to talk about the tariff situation . I feel like nobody_is really talking about this and we are just kind of sleep walking into it ... To be fair it is hard to predict how the market will react to the news and what will happen next . It seems very likely that the SC will rule against Trump here though . This will force the government to refund a massive amount of money and will produce a lot of chaos and uncertainty . While it may seem bullish on paper for tariffs to be struck down the reality is that Trump will find another avenue to proceed with . The net effect of this ruling would be that we essentially go back to square 1 . We have to refund an enormous amount of money and clarity on tariff policy just gets delayed even further . I think this is a situation where SC will rule against it because it isnt legal but it is probably not_in the best interest of your average citizen for them to do so . I say this not_because I believe in tariffs Im saying this because I feel the chaos that will ensue is going to be detrimental to the country at the end of the day . But thats beside the point . Im mostly interested in how you guys think markets will react . I dont see this as a particularly bullish event even though it may seem that way . Again I think the actual effect of this decision will be greater lack of clarity on policy and this is not_a positive for markets or the economy . There might be specific winners and losers that you can pick out interested to hear your thoughts . I think this should be a bigger concern than it is . I feel like nobody_is talking about this right now and I think it could move the market pretty significantly . I think January is going to be a VERY volatile month ."

Nvidia clearly dominates AI hardware today and has incredible momentum, but expectations are already extremely high. Google, on the other hand, feels more controversial: massive cash flow, distribution, data, TPUs, and vertical integration, but slower narrative and weaker stock performance relative to NVDA. If you had to choose only one for long-term AI exposure, which would you pick and why? (I hope I can ask that kind of question here?) 😎 I’m especially interested in arguments around valuation, durability of moat, and risk of competition, not short-term price targets. Thanks again",

Nvidia clearly dominates AI hardware today and has incredible momentum but expectations are already extremely high . Google on the other hand feels more controversial massive cash flow distribution data TPUs and vertical integration but slower narrative and weaker stock performance relative to NVDA . If you had to choose only one for longterm AI exposure which would you pick and why I hope I can ask that kind of question here 😎 I ’ m especially interested in arguments around valuation durability of moat and risk of competition not_shortterm price targets .

Today my coinbase account sits at $600 after selling the shitcoins at a loss and TD Ameritrade at $1400. Terrible investments, I know, but I've since learned about actual, more meaningful investments, so now I do a Roth IRA and HSA. I'd like to send the funds back to my bank account and reinvest into ETFs and maybe a small amount in PMs, though that's more like my investing side-chick right now. Will I pay taxes on funds that were ultimately a loss on my end? And if so, how do I go about filing and paying those taxes? I hate to see the money just sitting there so I want to put it to use again and actually get something out of it, and probably just liquidate the accounts after backing up any statements and info pertaining to them.",

This is how they have performed year to date: RDDT: +36% RKLB: +209% TSLA: +27% HOOD: +205% WMT: +24% GOOGL: +65% PLTR: +158% META: +11% MSTR: -47% AMD: +78% So, that's a total, average return of **76%** (which assumes you put 10 equal amounts in each of these stocks at the start of the year and didn't touch it until right now). Posting this today in case there's appetite to repeat the process for next year. EDIT: Many people are asking. I’ll post a top 10 (positively) tipped stocks on New Year’s Eve. It’ll be tallied from the stock recommendations here: [",

I’m thinking this may be an especially bullish day. Why? The S&P 500 is less than 1% from hitting the 7,000 milestone. I think a lot of people would like to see this benchmark hit and even better if it were to close above 7,000. Every other day in the Santa Claus rally is a mixed bag, we even have plenty of >1% drops during those days. I think if the bulls want to make a move and a statement then this Friday is it.

In the past 3 months, I've lost about 12k, and it genuinely hurts to think about what else that could've gone to. My tuition, a new car, literally anything else other than a donation to the market lol. It's all about lessons learned though. I'm glad I learned them as a college student while it's still inconsequential. Thank you, WSB. Genuinely, it's been an incredibly fun ride, despite losing a shit ton of money. I'm sticking to shares from now on P.S, before those comments come in saying \"$12k is nothing. You haven't lost anything,\" this was $12k that I've been working hard for and learning how to properly invest and make good returns on since high school and saving up, so please be kind lol. It was an important chunk of money to me.",

In the past 3 months Ive lost about 12k and it genuinely hurts to think about what else that couldve gone to . My tuition a new car literally anything else other than a donation to the market lol . Its all about lessons learned though . Im glad I learned them as a college student while its still inconsequential . Thank you WSB . Genuinely its been an incredibly fun ride despite losing a shit ton of money . Im sticking to shares from now on P.S before those comments come in saying $ 12k is nothing_You havent lost anything this was $ 12k that Ive been working hard for and learning how to properly invest and make good returns on since high school and saving up so please be kind lol . It was an important chunk of money to me ."

      "title": "Global semiconductor sales will reach $1 trillion by 2026, with these six companies set to be the biggest beneficiaries.",
      "selftext": "Various signs indicate that the artificial intelligence boom is not only showing no signs of cooling but is accelerating. Six stocks will lead the global $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, even as some AI skeptics remain on the sidelines due to perceived overvaluation. However, this industry is currently only in the middle phase of a decade long transformation process, with NVDA and AVGO as the dominant players. Global semiconductor sales are projected to surge 30% year over year in 2026, surpassing the historic $1 trillion annual sales threshold for the first time. I believe that if this is the case, we should focus on companies with “moats that can be quantified from their profit structures.” Beyond NVDA and AVGO, are the other four major semiconductor companies also worth attention: LRCX、KLAC、ADI and CDNS. They dominate their respective markets, holding market shares generally between 70% and 75%. Bank of America estimates that by 2030, the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion, growing at a CAGR of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion market opportunity. Despite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious due to the exorbitant costs of building AI data centers. A typical 1 gigawatt data center requires capital expenditures of around $60 billion, with roughly half allocated to hardware, Bank of America notes. This raises a critical question: Will these investments truly yield returns? Personally, I remain optimistic. Current spending is both “offensive” and “defensive.” In other words, large tech companies have no choice but to invest to defend their empires. NVDA stock has risen over 40% year to date. Perhaps we can no longer compare this AI giant to traditional chipmakers: the average price of a standard chip is $2.40, while Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) sell for around $30,000. Despite some market concerns that Nvidia's market cap may have peaked, Bank of America points out that the company is projected to generate $500 billion in free cash flow over the next three years, making its growth adjusted valuation “still extremely attractive.” NVDA current price to earnings growth ratio (PEG ratio, calculated as P/E ÷ earnings growth rate to assess whether a company's current stock price is reasonable relative to future earnings growth) stands at approximately 0.6x. By comparison, the S&P 500 index's PEG ratio approaches 2x. From a valuation perspective, NVDA appears quite attractive“valuation depends on the observer's perspective.” If Nvidia is the brain of AI, then Broadcom is its nervous system. AVGO stock has surged over 50% this year as the company has transformed from a component supplier into a pillar of AI infrastructure, now valued at $1.6 trillion. Its rise stems from custom built application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for hyperscale companies like Google and Meta. As these tech giants seek to reduce reliance on Nvidia, they are increasingly turning to Broadcom. But the road to a trillion dollar valuation will be “bumpy,” and no stock is “risk free.” So how should investors navigate AI and tech investments in 2026? What are your thoughts? Should we continue holding long term or...?",

      "selftext_processed": "Various signs indicate that the artificial intelligence boom is not_only showing no_signs of cooling but is accelerating . Six stocks will lead the global $ 1 trillion chip surge in 2026 even as some AI skeptics remain on the sidelines due to perceived overvaluation . However this industry is currently only in the middle phase of a decade long transformation process with NVDA and AVGO as the dominant players . Global semiconductor sales are projected to surge 30 % year over year in 2026 surpassing the historic $ 1 trillion annual sales threshold for the first time . I believe that if this is the case we should focus on companies with “ moats that can be quantified from their profit structures. ” Beyond NVDA and AVGO are the other four major semiconductor companies also worth attention LRCX、KLAC、ADI and CDNS . They dominate their respective markets holding market shares generally between 70 % and 75 % . Bank of America estimates that by 2030 the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $ 1.2 trillion growing at a CAGR of 38 % . AI accelerators alone represent a $ 900 billion market opportunity . Despite these staggering figures the market remains cautious due to the exorbitant costs of building AI data centers . A typical 1 gigawatt data center requires capital expenditures of around $ 60 billion with roughly half allocated to hardware Bank of America notes . This raises a critical question Will these investments truly yield returns Personally I remain optimistic . Current spending is both “ offensive ” and “ defensive. ” In other words large tech companies have no_choice but to invest to defend their empires . NVDA stock has risen over 40 % year to date . Perhaps we can no_longer compare this AI giant to traditional chipmakers the average price of a standard chip is $ 2.40 while Nvidias graphics processing units GPUs sell for around $ 30000 . Despite some market concerns that Nvidias market cap may have peaked Bank of America points out that the company is projected to generate $ 500 billion in free cash flow over the next three years making its growth adjusted valuation “ still extremely attractive. ” NVDA current price to earnings growth ratio PEG ratio calculated as PE ÷ earnings growth rate to assess whether a companys current stock price is reasonable relative to future earnings growth stands at approximately 0.6x . By comparison the SP 500 indexs PEG ratio approaches 2x . From a valuation perspective NVDA appears quite attractive “ valuation depends on the observers perspective. ” If Nvidia is the brain of AI then Broadcom is its nervous system . AVGO stock has surged over 50 % this year as the company has transformed from a component supplier into a pillar of AI infrastructure now valued at $ 1.6 trillion . Its rise stems from custom built application specific integrated circuits ASICs for hyperscale companies like Google and Meta . As these tech giants seek to reduce reliance on Nvidia they are increasingly turning to Broadcom . But the road to a trillion dollar valuation will be “ bumpy ” and no_stock is “ risk free. ” So how should investors navigate AI and tech investments in 2026 What are your thoughts Should we continue holding long term or ..."

      "selftext": "Gold and silver reached a new record high, and spot silver historically stood at 70 USD/ounce on Tuesday evening - far higher than the price per barrel of crude oil. The signal sent by the market seems to be very clear: in order to avoid the risk of depreciation of the legal currency, investors are investing in assets that are not controlled by any central bank or government. Assets that are not currently participating in the rise are also worthy of attention: such as \"digital gold\". In most of the cheap currency era after 2008, they succeeded in profiting from currency devaluation transactions. But now, the deal seems to have entered a new and possibly riskier stage, and traders have begun to turn to the original human risk-averse tool in the crisis. This phenomenon is quite meaningful: in the face of the choice of human creations such as legal currency and ancient natural value storage tools such as gold and silver, investors choose to trust the latter. If the currency continues to depreciate relative to gold, this impact will eventually be transmitted to other commodities such as industrial metals, and then enter the economic supply chain. Inflation may worsen, government bonds may fall, pushing up interest rates, and eventually causing market panic. In the past month alone, interest rates on long-term debt in most developed countries have risen by 0.15%-0.25%, which is clearly not a vote of confidence in the currency. The stability of the modern economy depends on the public's trust in the value of the monetary system, which cannot be overemphasized. Nowadays, this trust is gradually being shaken. Although they have not yet fallen into a crisis, central banks have been warned that if they remain sacent when gold and silver are soaring, the market may abandon them. It is worth noting that the last time the price of silver was so higher than that of crude oil was in the early 1980s. What was followed by vicious inflation, soaring interest rates, market collapse and economic recession. This future is not destined to come, but a similar financial crisis has now become a very realistic possibility. Will history come again? Should we choose to retreat from the rapids or move forward bravely? Why?",

      "selftext_processed": "Gold and silver reached a new record high and spot silver historically stood at 70 USDounce on Tuesday evening far higher than the price per barrel of crude oil . The signal sent by the market seems to be very clear in order to avoid the risk of depreciation of the legal currency investors are investing in assets that are not_controlled by any central bank or government . Assets that are not_currently participating in the rise are also worthy of attention such as digital gold . In most of the cheap currency era after 2008 they succeeded in profiting from currency devaluation transactions . But now the deal seems to have entered a new and possibly riskier stage and traders have begun to turn to the original human riskaverse tool in the crisis . This phenomenon is quite meaningful in the face of the choice of human creations such as legal currency and ancient natural value storage tools such as gold and silver investors choose to trust the latter . If the currency continues to depreciate relative to gold this impact will eventually be transmitted to other commodities such as industrial metals and then enter the economic supply chain . Inflation may worsen government bonds may fall pushing up interest rates and eventually causing market panic . In the past month alone interest rates on longterm debt in most developed countries have risen by 0.15 % 0.25 % which is clearly not_a vote of confidence in the currency . The stability of the modern economy depends on the publics trust in the value of the monetary system which can not be overemphasized . Nowadays this trust is gradually being shaken . Although they have not_yet fallen into a crisis central banks have been warned that if they remain sacent when gold and silver are soaring the market may abandon them . It is worth noting that the last time the price of silver was so higher than that of crude oil was in the early 1980s . What was followed by vicious inflation soaring interest rates market collapse and economic recession . This future is not_destined to come but a similar financial crisis has now become a very realistic possibility . Will history come again Should we choose to retreat from the rapids or move forward bravely Why"

      "selftext": "So, my market of choice (corporate bonds on amx exchange) is not very liquid, but has designated market makers who are obliged to submit daily quotations. For example, most traded amd security last month is [AMAMRBBN2ER0]( stunning 17 trades in a month! And a whole 50 trades in last year. But the bid, ask and spread are pretty uniform and you are guaranteed to buy/sell your bonds at fair-ish price (maximum spread is 5% by law, e.g. if the ask yield is 8%, then bid yield shall not exceed 8.4%). Basically, most of the time I (and other investors) just accept marketmaker's bid/ask price and trade at their conditions. However, I recently experimented with limit orders slightly above marketmaker's bid and below their ask. Well, it needs at least a couple of days to work, but they do eventually fill. But I have a question here: when the trading is mostly sporadic, how do I calculate opportunity cost here? Like, let's say I want to buy abovementioned AMRBBN2 on 24.12: I can guaranteed buy it today for 100.4377 (8.9049% ytm), or I can place an order for around 100.205 (about 9.35% ytm) and wait god knows how long for it. How can I try to predict, will the wait worth the difference in price? Are there some standard practices and approaches for illiquid markets, and what can I read about how it usually works in theory? I'm not sure if this could be timed, but if it could, how do I analyse when it's the best days to trade?",

      "selftext": "This is the story of a foreign investor who likes to read a lot, especially World and US news and documentaries, whose luck has been a bit different. I tried investing in the US stock market for the first time in late 2008 and early 2009. Unfortunately, I did not have access to the US stock market or a brokerage firm, and most importantly, I was only 25 years old and had little to no money saved for investing. My gut feeling told me that this was the time to start investing, even before the expression \"buy the dip\" existed. I tried to convince my parents, especially my mom, that there was no way in hell that the US stock market would crash forever, that a bailout was coming for AIG and Bank of America. That if banks in my home country had been bailed out before in 1999, it would obviously happen in the US too. That the US had a big unlimited printer and whatever happened they would print their way out of it. My home country during 2007 to 2009 had a bonanza period, so the Great Depression was not felt as badly as it was in other parts of the world. Plus, people still had the bank run of 1999 very present in their minds. So investing in the US stock market seemed awfully risky. I was not able to convince them. My big chance to invest, not even my money, was gone by 2010. I stopped thinking about investing in the US stock market for many years. Until 2020 hit. COVID 19 arrived and the world seemed to be coming to an end, the market started to dip abruptly. This was my time to invest, I thought. The world would not end with a virus. If it did, there was no reason to have savings stored somewhere. If the world came back as resilient as it is, I would be making good money. I was 36 years old, had some savings this time, but I still had no access to the US stock market. I desperately tried to open a brokerage account as soon as the market plunged. It was now or never, I thought. I tried one company, no luck, then another one, same result. I was not even able to open a bank account from abroad. The market had already crashed and was rapidly going up again. I traveled to the US as soon as flights started opening internationally for tourism. One of my first stops was a brokerage firm in Miami. I opened my account and felt I had finally gained access to the door of wealth creation, freedom, and liberty. I then had to return to my home country to transfer money abroad. Unfortunately, I lost some more time because I had to pay a currency exit tax of 5 percent, which made me doubt whether it was still worth it. The market had almost recovered from its crash. Certificates of deposit in my home country paid about 6 percent annually. That meant losing a relatively safe investment and the interest earned over a year. I made calculation after calculation. Lump sum beats DCA. Time in the market beats timing the market. ETFs are safer than single equities. I learned how NRAs, dividends, cash, reinvested, qualified, taxes, shorts, calls, and puts work. I paid the currency exit tax and finally entered the market. I finally started investing in late September 2021. A couple of months later, the market crashed about 21 percent. I was extremely mad at myself. I had invested at an all time high. I knew interest rate hikes by the Fed would affect the market, but I was not sure how. People could start selling since the \"free money\" period was over, or they could rush into the stock market since with high inflation it could perform better than other assets. Seeing my investment plunge 21 percent was not easy. Again, I basically forgot about the stock market for a couple of years. Fast forward to April 2024. My home country was in political turmoil. CDs no longer felt safe. I could lose all of it in a heartbeat if a populist, communist socialist government came into power. Plus, the currency exit tax had temporarily decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent. I decided to transfer six figures from my home country to my dormant brokerage account. I had checked my portfolio after many years, from 2022 to mid 2024, my portfolio had increased about 7 percent, which meant I had made roughly 1 percent more than if I had left that money in a CD. That made me feel a bit better. I did not act swiftly with the newly transferred six figures, and this is what I regret a lot, especially considering the bull run that has followed. Since I was psychologically hit by the 2022 crash, and because there is always someone somewhere saying that the next crash is imminent, I turned to Treasury investments. They paid a \"safe\" 4 to 4.5 percent, which was historically high according to my research, and were considered the safest investment possible. I invested all of it in T bills paying about 4.5 percent, and a bit in notes that paid periodic interest. I learned how to calculate yields and expiration values. It felt good, but at the same time I felt I was missing the current bull run. My money was frozen for 30, 45, or 100 days at a time. As soon as a bill or note expired, I purchased a new one. The market crash was imminent, I thought. Fast forward to October 29, 2025. I had about 300 thousand dollars in Treasury notes expiring that day. I analyzed the market. It had gone up, and by a lot. \"VOO and chill,\" I remembered reading many times in Reddit. VOO had only gone up during that period. Same with QQQ, VTI, and VT. Even international markets like the IBEX 35 had increased sharply compared to my modest 4 percent in Treasuries. I went all in on the stock market again on October 29, 2025. Lump sum, all of it. Plus some money in a company called NVDA, which a friend living in the US and working in the tech industry said promised high returns. I had bought my first NVDA shares in June 2024 at 128 dollars per share, we thought it was already too expensive back then. Now it is December 24, 2025, and the market has not yet recovered from its October 29 peak. Sometimes I wonder how I manage to invest exclusively at all time highs, or how I fail to invest when I know it is the right time. I have missed investing in two big crashes, 2008 and 2020, and invested twice before two big dips, 2022 and 2025. Now everyone is talking about an AI bubble, similar to the 2008 bubble. Is there really an AI bubble. And for those who do not know, recouping your wealth if you invested at the peak of 2008 took almost 10 years. I am not sure what to do now. Should I cash out. Wait a bit longer. Is there really an AI bubble. Will it burst soon. Perhaps I should add that I strongly believe that AI will change the world forever. That many, or the vast majority of jobs will be replaced by AI and robots. That work will become optional. That humanity will have to reinvent itself to understand income, work, meaning, and the purpose of life. Well, that is my true story.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the story of a foreign investor who likes to read a lot especially World and US news and documentaries whose luck has been a bit different . I tried investing in the US stock market for the first time in late 2008 and early 2009 . Unfortunately I did not_have access to the US stock market or a brokerage firm and most importantly I was only 25 years old and had little to no_money saved for investing . My gut feeling told me that this was the time to start investing even before the expression buy the dip existed . I tried to convince my parents especially my mom that there was no_way in hell that the US stock market would crash forever that a bailout was coming for AIG and Bank of America . That if banks in my home country had been bailed out before in 1999 it would obviously happen in the US too . That the US had a big unlimited printer and whatever happened they would print their way out of it . My home country during 2007 to 2009 had a bonanza period so the Great Depression was not_felt as badly as it was in other parts of the world . Plus people still had the bank run of 1999 very present in their minds . So investing in the US stock market seemed awfully risky . I was not_able to convince them . My big chance to invest not_even my money was gone by 2010 . I stopped thinking about investing in the US stock market for many years . Until 2020 hit . COVID 19 arrived and the world seemed to be coming to an end the market started to dip abruptly . This was my time to invest I thought . The world would not_end with a virus . If it did there was no_reason to have savings stored somewhere . If the world came back as resilient as it is I would be making good money . I was 36 years old had some savings this time but I still had no_access to the US stock market . I desperately tried to open a brokerage account as soon as the market plunged . It was now or never_I thought . I tried one company no_luck then another one same result . I was not_even able to open a bank account from abroad . The market had already crashed and was rapidly going up again . I traveled to the US as soon as flights started opening internationally for tourism . One of my first stops was a brokerage firm in Miami . I opened my account and felt I had finally gained access to the door of wealth creation freedom and liberty . I then had to return to my home country to transfer money abroad . Unfortunately I lost some more time because I had to pay a currency exit tax of 5 percent which made me doubt whether it was still worth it . The market had almost recovered from its crash . Certificates of deposit in my home country paid about 6 percent annually . That meant losing a relatively safe investment and the interest earned over a year . I made calculation after calculation . Lump sum beats DCA . Time in the market beats timing the market . ETFs are safer than single equities . I learned how NRAs dividends cash reinvested qualified taxes shorts calls and puts work . I paid the currency exit tax and finally entered the market . I finally started investing in late September 2021 . A couple of months later the market crashed about 21 percent . I was extremely mad at myself . I had invested at an all time high . I knew interest rate hikes by the Fed would affect the market but I was not_sure how . People could start selling since the free money period was over or they could rush into the stock market since with high inflation it could perform better than other assets . Seeing my investment plunge 21 percent was not_easy . Again I basically forgot about the stock market for a couple of years . Fast forward to April 2024 . My home country was in political turmoil . CDs no_longer felt safe . I could lose all of it in a heartbeat if a populist communist socialist government came into power . Plus the currency exit tax had temporarily decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent . I decided to transfer six figures from my home country to my dormant brokerage account . I had checked my portfolio after many years from 2022 to mid 2024 my portfolio had increased about 7 percent which meant I had made roughly 1 percent more than if I had left that money in a CD . That made me feel a bit better . I did not_act swiftly with the newly transferred six figures and this is what I regret a lot especially considering the bull run that has followed . Since I was psychologically hit by the 2022 crash and because there is always someone somewhere saying that the next crash is imminent I turned to Treasury investments . They paid a safe 4 to 4.5 percent which was historically high according to my research and were considered the safest investment possible . I invested all of it in T bills paying about 4.5 percent and a bit in notes that paid periodic interest . I learned how to calculate yields and expiration values . It felt good but at the same time I felt I was missing the current bull run . My money was frozen for 30 45 or 100 days at a time . As soon as a bill or note expired I purchased a new one . The market crash was imminent I thought . Fast forward to October 29 2025 . I had about 300 thousand dollars in Treasury notes expiring that day . I analyzed the market . It had gone up and by a lot . VOO and chill I remembered reading many times in Reddit . VOO had only gone up during that period . Same with QQQ VTI and VT . Even international markets like the IBEX 35 had increased sharply compared to my modest 4 percent in Treasuries . I went all in on the stock market again on October 29 2025 . Lump sum all of it . Plus some money in a company called NVDA which a friend living in the US and working in the tech industry said promised high returns . I had bought my first NVDA shares in June 2024 at 128 dollars per share we thought it was already too expensive back then . Now it is December 24 2025 and the market has not_yet recovered from its October 29 peak . Sometimes I wonder how I manage to invest exclusively at all time highs or how I fail to invest when I know it is the right time . I have missed investing in two big crashes 2008 and 2020 and invested twice before two big dips 2022 and 2025 . Now everyone is talking about an AI bubble similar to the 2008 bubble . Is there really an AI bubble . And for those who do not_know recouping your wealth if you invested at the peak of 2008 took almost 10 years . I am not_sure what to do now . Should I cash out . Wait a bit longer . Is there really an AI bubble . Will it burst soon . Perhaps I should add that I strongly believe that AI will change the world forever . That many or the vast majority of jobs will be replaced by AI and robots . That work will become optional . That humanity will have to reinvent itself to understand income work meaning and the purpose of life . Well that is my true story ."

      "selftext": "Stocks that experience continuous sharp increases are often short-term in nature. This is especially true for stocks that haven't undergone sufficient consolidation at the bottom but instead begin a rapid, continuous upward surge. Holding such stocks can lead to significant gains in a short period, but the key is whether you can cash out in time. It's important not to rush to sell before a top signal appears; you should ride the trend as long as possible. This point is crucial. Furthermore, this post emphasizes short-term, continuous sharp increases; long-term selling methods are not included here. To seize the best selling opportunity and successfully realize the profits from short-term surges, investors need to grasp the following three key points: First, determine the selling timing based on candlestick patterns. 1. When a stock experiences a continuous sharp increase, consider selling if signals such as a doji, inverted hammer, hanging man, high open with a large bearish candle, companion line, or a bearish engulfing pattern (covering 2/3 of the previous day's bullish candle body) appear. 2. Top reversal pattern. If this pattern appears, sell decisively. 3. Similar to a spinning top pattern. Sell. 4. Consider selling if the price fails to break above the previous high for two consecutive days or only symbolically breaks above it. 5. Selling when the price breaks below the rising support moving average is an option, but not the best timing. Second, determine the selling timing based on trading volume and price action. 1. Consider selling if there are continuous large buy orders but the price shows obvious signs of stagnation. 2. Consider selling if the intraday chart shows rapid upward movement followed by a sharp decline with high volume and excessive price fluctuations. 3. Consider selling if there is abnormally high volume and high turnover after a continuous upward surge (excluding breakout situations). 4. Consider selling if the stock opens significantly lower the next day after a continuous upward surge. 5. Consider selling if new hot sectors emerge and show overall strength. Third, determine the selling timing based on time cycles. In a strong market, the upward trend usually lasts a maximum of 7 days. While there are stocks that continue to rise for more than seven days, they are very rare, so don't bet on these exceptional cases. In a weak market, the upward trend typically lasts around three days. The most important thing in short-term trading is to avoid greed and to change direction promptly. For short-term trading experts, determining the best selling opportunity involves the one-line method, which means exiting based on the top signal of a single candlestick. Conservative investors can use the two-line method, but this method is often lagging; for investors who didn't manage to sell at the highest point, when the candlestick breaks through the support line, it's the last chance to salvage the situation. If this opportunity is missed, a continuous downward trend will follow, and it will be too late to cut losses, making losses and being trapped in the market inevitable. In short-term trading, don't rely too much on auxiliary indicators like MACD and KDJ, as their lagging nature can easily lead to missing the best opportunity. I'm curious how everyone handles stocks that are rising parabolically. What exit signals do you typically use?",

      "selftext_processed": "Stocks that experience continuous sharp increases are often shortterm in nature . This is especially true for stocks that havent undergone sufficient consolidation at the bottom but instead begin a rapid continuous upward surge . Holding such stocks can lead to significant gains in a short period but the key is whether you can cash out in time . Its important not_to rush to sell before a top signal appears you should ride the trend as long as possible . This point is crucial . Furthermore this post emphasizes shortterm continuous sharp increases longterm selling methods are not_included here . To seize the best selling opportunity and successfully realize the profits from shortterm surges investors need to grasp the following three key points First determine the selling timing based on candlestick patterns . 1 . When a stock experiences a continuous sharp increase consider selling if signals such as a doji inverted hammer hanging man high open with a large bearish candle companion line or a bearish engulfing pattern covering 23 of the previous days bullish candle body appear . 2 . Top reversal pattern . If this pattern appears sell decisively . 3 . Similar to a spinning top pattern . Sell . 4 . Consider selling if the price fails to break above the previous high for two consecutive days or only symbolically breaks above it . 5 . Selling when the price breaks below the rising support moving average is an option but not_the best timing . Second determine the selling timing based on trading volume and price action . 1 . Consider selling if there are continuous large buy orders but the price shows obvious signs of stagnation . 2 . Consider selling if the intraday chart shows rapid upward movement followed by a sharp decline with high volume and excessive price fluctuations . 3 . Consider selling if there is abnormally high volume and high turnover after a continuous upward surge excluding breakout situations . 4 . Consider selling if the stock opens significantly lower the next day after a continuous upward surge . 5 . Consider selling if new hot sectors emerge and show overall strength . Third determine the selling timing based on time cycles . In a strong market the upward trend usually lasts a maximum of 7 days . While there are stocks that continue to rise for more than seven days they are very rare so dont bet on these exceptional cases . In a weak market the upward trend typically lasts around three days . The most important thing in shortterm trading is to avoid greed and to change direction promptly . For shortterm trading experts determining the best selling opportunity involves the oneline method which means exiting based on the top signal of a single candlestick . Conservative investors can use the twoline method but this method is often lagging for investors who didnt manage to sell at the highest point when the candlestick breaks through the support line its the last chance to salvage the situation . If this opportunity is missed a continuous downward trend will follow and it will be too late to cut losses making losses and being trapped in the market inevitable . In shortterm trading dont rely too much on auxiliary indicators like MACD and KDJ as their lagging nature can easily lead to missing the best opportunity . Im curious how everyone handles stocks that are rising parabolically . What exit signals do you typically use"

This will force institutions that track the index (think passive mutual funds and ETFs) to buy shares of PATH. Rough math says that about 70 million shares will need to be bought. We're already seeing the stock pop pre-market on the news, but the real index buying probably won't happen until near market close December 31 (the last trading day before Jan 2nd) as funds add PATH to prepare for the inclusion in the index on Jan 2nd. But wait there's more...the latest short interest report shows that there's currently over 48 million shares sold short - that's 11% of the float, which is a pretty big amount. If those shorts don't close before the forced institutional index buying, this could cause a spicy short squeeze to kick off 2026.",

      "selftext": "I'm 47, investing for retirement in 20-25 years. I've been disciplined with my strategy: between 20 to 25k /year into broad market index funds (similar to VT/VEQT), split between retirement accounts. Recently, I've been feeling FOMO watching various sectors rally (space, commodities, mega-cap tech). My strategy has been working, but I'm tempted to allocate 5-8% into speculative plays like: Space sector ETFs or individual names Mega-cap tech that's \"lagging\" (thinking it'll catch up) Commodities riding recent momentum. My concern: Am I letting recency bias and FOMO drive me away from a solid long-term strategy? Questions for the community: For those 10+ years into index investing, have you successfully added speculative positions without derailing your plan? Is there merit to \"scratching the itch\" with a small allocation to stay disciplined on the core, or does it usually snowball? At what point does \"diversification into sectors\" become counterproductive stock-picking? Not looking for specific ticker advice, just perspective from experienced investors who've navigated this psychological challenge. Thanks",

Recently Ive been feeling FOMO watching various sectors rally space commodities megacap tech . My strategy has been working but Im tempted to allocate 58 % into speculative plays like Space sector ETFs or individual names Megacap tech thats lagging thinking itll catch up Commodities riding recent momentum . My concern Am I letting recency bias and FOMO drive me away from a solid longterm strategy Questions for the community For those 10 years into index investing have you successfully added speculative positions without derailing your plan Is there merit to scratching the itch with a small allocation to stay disciplined on the core or does it usually snowball At what point does diversification into sectors become counterproductive stockpicking Not_looking for specific ticker advice just perspective from experienced investors whove navigated this psychological challenge . Thanks"

      "selftext": "So I'm currently running 2 airbnbs in my town with a price of $70usd per night and I see there's a huge opportunity where you can make an airbnb with swimming pool + amazing interior design and then you can up the price to $500 USD per night. I'm building this banglo and will split it into two units of airbnb. Each unit can accommodate up to 10 guests, 4 bedroom, 5 beds and 3 bathroom. I'm planning to charge $500 USD per night for this one. Let's do the math: $500usd x 15nights (normal season) = $7,500usd $7,500usd - $600expenses = $6,900usd $6,900usd * 70% profit sharing with my airbnb manager = $4,830usd $4,830usd x 2units = $9,660 net profit per month $9,660 x 12months = $115,920usd per year net profit So the capex for land acquisition, construction, interior design, swimming pool construction, air conditioner, electronics like tv etc is $250k give or take. Annual net profit is $115,920usd. So that gives you around 45% - 50% annual roi give or take. My question to you is, I've looked around the investment opportunities in Kuala Lumpur and I can't find one with this much roi. It's like I have found the holy grail. The closest investment opportunity I found is called Balitecture in bali. Actually I'm copying their bali themed interior design home and make one for my airbnb. Their roi is much higher since bali is more touristry. So my question is, is this as high as it can get or there's higher returns in terms of property and airbnb? I'm also thinking of doing like balitecture where I build airbnb villas for foreigners to buy the property and they can earn the profits. TL;DR: $250k investment, 50.5% annual ROI ($100k USD per year net profit)",

The chairman and CIO of Navellier Associates investment firm thinks AI trade concerns are easing with many strong market areas . Smallcap stocks are showing impressive momentum indicating investors are more willing to take risks as they prepare for the new year . The chief market strategist at Nationwide stated The last two weeks of the year are the best on the calendar since 1950 as investors position for year end . He pointed out that the market has been positive 80 % of the time with an average gain of 1.6 % since 1928 . The president and CIO of investment advisory firm Bellwether Wealth stated Even though the market may feel turbulent in recent weeks stocks have largely stayed rangebound so far in December and the yearend seasonal strength may just be the catalyst we need for the market to break out of its narrow trading range . CIO of Granite Bay Wealth Management stated that The combination of low volume and an absence of bad news should keep the Santa Claus rally alive and well for the rest of 2025 Valuations in tech are high but some Mag 7 names have actually underperformed the SP 500 this year which suggests that there is still more room to run and that not_all tech stocks are trading at runaway or complacent valuations . He is also going pro for the Santa Claus rally ."

      "selftext": "I like the way my friend treats money and investments. So I have a friend who's kind of obsessive about investment due diligence, and honestly, I used to think he was paranoid. Now I think he's a genius. For any private investment over $50K, he has a standing process: lawyer reviews the legal docs, AND he hires [private investigator]( to verify everything else. Every single time. No exceptions. I'm talking real estate deals, private equity, syndications, business partnerships - doesn't matter. If it's not a publicly traded security with regulatory oversight, he investigates. His reasoning: \"A lawyer tells me if the contract is legal. An investigator tells me if the *people* are honest and the *claims* are real. Both matter.\" Three times this saved his @ ss: Deal 1: Real estate development fund ($250K almost lost) - Luxury condo development in Seattle, 18% returns promised. Lawyer said contract looked fine. PI investigation found the developer's \"previous successful projects\" actually failed with investor losses, multiple hidden lawsuits, fake pre-sales, and inflated property appraisal. Investigation cost about $5K, saved $250K when project never broke ground. Deal 2: Tech startup ($200K + avoided lawsuit) - \"Pre-IPO\" opportunity with claimed patents and Fortune 500 partnerships. Legal structure was proper. PI found \"patents\" were just applications not grants, \"partnerships\" were only discussions, revenue was fabricated through related parties, and founder had scammed investors before. It saved $200K plus lawsuit trouble. Company collapsed, SEC investigated for fraud. Deal 3: Private lending ($150K saved) - Bridge loan secured by commercial property. Note looked legally sound. PI discovered property had $500K in senior liens making the position worthless, borrower had bankruptcy pattern, business was losing money, and assets were judgment-proof. Cost $3K, saved $150K when borrower defaulted months later. And this works! Lawyers catch legal problems. Investigators catch *people* problems and *truth* problems. A contract can be perfectly legal and still be a terrible investment if the person behind it is dishonest or incompetent. Most fraud isn't illegal contract terms - it's lying about facts. \"We have this partnership\" (we don't). \"Property is worth this\" (it's not). \"I've successfully done this before\" (actually failed). Lawyers don't verify claims, they verify legal structure. That's where investigators come in. I used to think my friend was paranoid. Now I think everyone else is naive. In public markets you have regulatory oversight, audited financials, disclosures. In private investments? You have whatever the promoter tells you. Spending 2-5% of investment amount on professional verification isn't paranoia, it's basic risk management. Yeah, sometimes the investigation finds nothing wrong and you pay $3-5K for peace of mind. But when it catches something? The ROI is infinite. Anyone else do this level of due diligence? Or am I and my friend the weird ones?",

So I have a friend whos kind of obsessive about investment due diligence and honestly I used to think he was paranoid . Now I think hes a genius . For any private investment over $ 50K he has a standing process lawyer reviews the legal docs AND he hires private investigator to verify everything else . Every single time . No_exceptions . Im talking real estate deals private equity syndications business partnerships doesnt matter . If its not_a publicly traded security with regulatory oversight he investigates . His reasoning A lawyer tells me if the contract is legal . An investigator tells me if the people are honest and the claims are real . Both matter . Three times this saved his ss Deal 1 Real estate development fund $ 250K almost lost Luxury condo development in Seattle 18 % returns promised . Lawyer said contract looked fine . PI investigation found the developers previous successful projects actually failed with investor losses multiple hidden lawsuits fake presales and inflated property appraisal . Investigation cost about $ 5K saved $ 250K when project never_broke ground . Deal 2 Tech startup $ 200K avoided lawsuit PreIPO opportunity with claimed patents and Fortune 500 partnerships . Legal structure was proper . PI found patents were just applications not_grants partnerships were only discussions revenue was fabricated through related parties and founder had scammed investors before . It saved $ 200K plus lawsuit trouble . Company collapsed SEC investigated for fraud . Deal 3 Private lending $ 150K saved Bridge loan secured by commercial property . Note looked legally sound . PI discovered property had $ 500K in senior liens making the position worthless borrower had bankruptcy pattern business was losing money and assets were judgmentproof . Cost $ 3K saved $ 150K when borrower defaulted months later . And this works Lawyers catch legal problems . Investigators catch people problems and truth problems . A contract can be perfectly legal and still be a terrible investment if the person behind it is dishonest or incompetent . Most fraud isnt illegal contract terms its lying about facts . We have this partnership we dont . Property is worth this its not_Ive successfully done this before actually failed . Lawyers dont verify claims they verify legal structure . Thats where investigators come in . I used to think my friend was paranoid . Now I think everyone else is naive . In public markets you have regulatory oversight audited financials disclosures . In private investments You have whatever the promoter tells you . Spending 25 % of investment amount on professional verification isnt paranoia its basic risk management . Yeah sometimes the investigation finds nothing_wrong and you pay $ 35K for peace of mind . But when it catches something The ROI is infinite . Anyone else do this level of due diligence Or am I and my friend the weird ones"

I just got back this email, saying \"you recently requested the removal of securities deemed worthless in your Robinhood account. Your request couldn’t be completed because there has been recent activity that suggests there may still be an active market for the security you requested to remove. Robinhood cannot remove a security that has or may have an active market. An active market could be indicated through trading data reported across the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), recent bid/ask data, or other trading data.\" Is there anything I can do? Is there a way I can take a loss on this bankrupt stock so that I can offset it against my gains? I was not expecting this reply. I also have a limit sell order for SDCCQ for $0.0001 but its not selling. Any advice?",

I know everything is pretty much at ATH but im aiming to be invested for at least 3-5 years so im thinking time in the market is better than timing it. Been researching, adding and removing tickers from my list for over a month now. I think I’ve settled on these. Will be investing about £5,000 which I know isn’t a huge amount. I’ve tried to keep a decent mix of core stocks and upside. Very aware that some of these have had monumental years, but I do believe they will continue to grow (especially in my time frame). GOOGL RR.L JPM AMZN BULL ASTS RKLB NBIS SOFI LUNR TTWO ASTS scares me having not launched anything yet. Could be really overvalued but don’t want to miss the opportunities of back to back good news throughout 2026. I can see RKLB being one of two household space names along with SpaceX in 5 years. AMZN I think is undervalued currently and will continue to be world leading. RR for its diversification/defence and nuclear. JPM is just all round solid. Couple of moonshots and then TTWO because the world’s been waiting for GTA 6 for 13 years and it’s going to be the biggest video game release in history, and then subsequent earnings. BULL take it or leave it tbh but seems incredibly cheap for its earnings. Considerable upside. Please give me feedback. Is this too many for a £5k investment. I can’t narrow them down anymore.",

Been researching adding and removing tickers from my list for over a month now . I think I ’ ve settled on these . Will be investing about £5000 which I know isn ’ t a huge amount . I ’ ve tried to keep a decent mix of core stocks and upside . Very aware that some of these have had monumental years but I do believe they will continue to grow especially in my time frame . GOOGL RR.L JPM AMZN BULL ASTS RKLB NBIS SOFI LUNR TTWO ASTS scares me having not_launched anything yet . Could be really overvalued but don ’ t want to miss the opportunities of back to back good news throughout 2026 . I can see RKLB being one of two household space names along with SpaceX in 5 years . AMZN I think is undervalued currently and will continue to be world leading . RR for its diversificationdefence and nuclear . JPM is just all round solid . Couple of moonshots and then TTWO because the world ’ s been waiting for GTA 6 for 13 years and it ’ s going to be the biggest video game release in history and then subsequent earnings . BULL take it or leave it tbh but seems incredibly cheap for its earnings . Considerable upside . Please give me feedback . Is this too many for a £5k investment . I can ’ t narrow them down anymore ."

      "selftext": "Okay, so I managed to run up 500 to 90k within a month and then proceeded to lose nearly all within a week, so far managing to lose \\~80k in the span of one week. Now I’m down to my last 13.5k (transferred everything over to robinhood due to slightly more favorable buying power rules as seen in the last image which says 11.5k but another 2k wire is en route from webull so it’s 13.5k). Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely, but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions. Let this be a warning to everyone else not to delude yourself into thinking you’re a genius when you get lucky with gambling. Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn’t. 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I’m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future, so it’s certainly not the end of the world, but damn does this hurt. Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks. Probably gonna need some time to mentally recover from this. TDLR: Don’t touch options. They will ruin your life.",

Now I ’ m down to my last 13.5k transferred everything over to robinhood due to slightly more favorable buying power rules as seen in the last image which says 11.5k but another 2k wire is en route from webull so it ’ s 13.5k . Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions . Let this be a warning to everyone else not_to delude yourself into thinking you ’ re a genius when you get lucky with gambling . Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn ’ t . 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I ’ m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future so it ’ s certainly not_the end of the world but damn does this hurt . Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks . Probably gon na need some time to mentally recover from this . TDLR Don ’ t touch options . They will ruin your life ."

From what I understand: * Most **Indian mutual funds** qualify as **PFICs** under US tax law * PFIC taxation can mean: * Punitive tax rates * Interest charges * Complex annual filing (Form 8621) * Even “plain vanilla” equity or index mutual funds in India fall under PFIC rules * ETFs and stocks listed in the US do *not* have this issue My questions: 1. Is it correct that **almost all Indian mutual funds are PFICs**, regardless of fund type? 2. Are there *any* realistic exceptions or structures that avoid PFIC treatment? 3. Do most US NRIs: * Avoid Indian mutual funds entirely? * Use US-domiciled ETFs instead? * Stick to bank products (FDs/RDs) despite lower returns? 4. Practically speaking, is the compliance + tax drag so bad that Indian mutual funds are just not worth it for US taxpayers? I’m not asking for personal tax advice, just looking to validate my understanding and hear how others have approached this trade-off in practice. Thanks in advance!",

      "title": "MSTR: Why 2026 Could Be a Massive Year",
      "selftext": "TL;DR: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is trading below the value of it's Bitcoin holdings. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong, positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle, and supported by growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Slide & Market Factors - Macro risk-off: BTC dropped 30-40% from October highs due to higher rates, tech volatility, and a strong USD. ETF outflows & liquidations: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.4B outflows in Nov 2025; leveraged crypto positions triggered $1B in forced liquidations. Crypto winter: BTC erased much of its YTD gains. When Bitcoin falls, “Bitcoin proxy” stocks like MSTR often fall even more. MSTR = Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure - Bitcoin-driven stock: MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down. During the recent dip, MSTR dropped faster than BTC. Balance sheet buys: MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt, giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility. Software business: Enterprise analytics platform still grows (Q3 2025 revenue \\~$128.7M, +10.9% YoY; subscription revenue \\~$46M, +65% YoY). Small compared to BTC, but it exists. Bitcoin Holdings & Per-Share Math - Total BTC: 671,268 BTC ($58.4B at $87,049/BTC) 87,000/BTC). Shares outstanding (diluted): \\~312,000,000 BTC per share: 671,268 ÷ 312,000,000 ≈ 0.00215 BTC/share Dollar value per share of BTC: 0.00215 × $87,000 ≈ $187/share MSTR trades at \\~$157.88. Each share represents roughly $187 of Bitcoin value, plus a small, growing software business and cash reserves. Market cap vs BTC holdings: \\~$46B vs \\~$58.4B, trading below implied BTC value. Impact of BTC moves: Every $10,000 rise in BTC adds \\~$21.5/share or \\~$6.7B total to MSTR’s BTC holdings. Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 - Post-halving cycle dynamics: Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024. Historically, years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases (2012, 2016, 2020). Supply growth slows, while demand continues to increase. Institutional accumulation: Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips, adding structural demand. Banks entering crypto services: JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading, lending, and custody services. Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral, unlocking liquidity without selling BTC. More institutional access reduces perceived risk, increases adoption, and supports price stability. Macro tailwinds: If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases, risk assets like BTC historically outperform. Global adoption & limited supply: More users, corporations, and payment integration, combined with a capped supply (21M BTC), drives scarcity and potential upside. Why 2026 Could Be Favorable - BTC leverage: If Bitcoin rallies, MSTR (and MSTU) amplifies the move. Balance sheet & capital strategy: They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt. Software + subscriptions: Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto. Structural advantage: Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets. Institutional tailwinds: Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand. Bottom line: MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong. With historical post-halving trends, institutional accumulation, limited supply, and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin, 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains. Current positions: 2x leverage MSTR Bull (MSTU) - 2890 units @ $9.92. Continuing to DCA",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR MicroStrategy MSTR is trading below the value of its Bitcoin holdings . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle and supported by growing institutional adoption . Bitcoin ’ s Slide Market Factors Macro riskoff BTC dropped 3040 % from October highs due to higher rates tech volatility and a strong USD . ETF outflows liquidations Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 3.4B outflows in Nov 2025 leveraged crypto positions triggered $ 1B in forced liquidations . Crypto winter BTC erased much of its YTD gains . When Bitcoin falls “ Bitcoin proxy ” stocks like MSTR often fall even more . MSTR Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure Bitcoindriven stock MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down . During the recent dip MSTR dropped faster than BTC . Balance sheet buys MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility . Software business Enterprise analytics platform still grows Q3 2025 revenue $ 128.7M 10.9 % YoY subscription revenue $ 46M 65 % YoY . Small compared to BTC but it exists . Bitcoin Holdings PerShare Math Total BTC 671268 BTC $ 58.4B at $ 87049BTC 87000BTC . Shares outstanding diluted 312000000 BTC per share 671268 ÷ 312000000 ≈ 0.00215 BTCshare Dollar value per share of BTC 0.00215 × $ 87000 ≈ $ 187share MSTR trades at $ 157.88 . Each share represents roughly $ 187 of Bitcoin value plus a small growing software business and cash reserves . Market cap vs BTC holdings $ 46B vs $ 58.4B trading below implied BTC value . Impact of BTC moves Every $ 10000 rise in BTC adds $ 21.5share or $ 6.7B total to MSTR ’ s BTC holdings . Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 Posthalving cycle dynamics Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024 . Historically years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases 2012 2016 2020 . Supply growth slows while demand continues to increase . Institutional accumulation Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips adding structural demand . Banks entering crypto services JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading lending and custody services . Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral unlocking liquidity without selling BTC . More institutional access reduces perceived risk increases adoption and supports price stability . Macro tailwinds If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases risk assets like BTC historically outperform . Global adoption limited supply More users corporations and payment integration combined with a capped supply 21M BTC drives scarcity and potential upside . Why 2026 Could Be Favorable BTC leverage If Bitcoin rallies MSTR and MSTU amplifies the move . Balance sheet capital strategy They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt . Software subscriptions Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto . Structural advantage Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets . Institutional tailwinds Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand . Bottom line MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong . With historical posthalving trends institutional accumulation limited supply and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains . Current positions 2x leverage MSTR Bull MSTU 2890 units $ 9.92 . Continuing to DCA"

      "selftext": "I have an account with $700 and I’m asking for opinions on which equity or ETF I should buy. I understand this is not financial advice and that everyone’s situation is different; I’m looking to learn, compare ideas, and have little fun with a small amount of money. Years ago, I was lucky with Pier 1 (bought at $0.50, sold at $25) and Party City (bought at $0.75, sold at $10). More recently, GameStop and a few others did well. I’ve also had losers. One painful example: I bought a stock at $0.10, it rose to $90, but I wasn’t aware of it at the time, forgot to sell, and it eventually crashed.",

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching Broadcom (AVGO) closely, and it feels like the debate around this stock has quietly shifted. This isn’t really about “is Broadcom a good company?” anymore almost everyone agrees it is. The real question seems to be: Has the market already priced in too much perfection? Here’s where I see the split: Bull case: Strong AI networking + custom silicon exposure Massive backlog with hyperscaler customers Software cash flows (VMware) supporting buybacks and dividends Management with a long track record of execution Bear case: Valuation already assumes sustained AI capex with no hiccups AI related products may pressure margins near term Backlog ≠ guaranteed revenue timing If AI spending cools even slightly, there’s not much valuation cushion What makes AVGO tricky is that it’s not a hype stock it’s a disciplined compounder but it’s now being priced like an AI must-win. So I’m curious how others here think about it: Is AVGO fairly valued given its consistency and cash flow, or Is this one of those names where “great company” ≠ “great entry price” right now? Not trying to push a trade genuinely interested in how long term investors here are framing the risk/reward at these levels.",

This is a conviction portfolio. I’m 19, I have 60k to invest, and I’m willing to take on risk. I’m not the type to fold under pressure. Even if there are 5 bad years in a row, I’ll stay strong, and if anything, buy more as long as the fundamentals are solid. I want to create the structure of my portfolio and stick to it, and make yearly rebalances. I’m coming here one more time before I officially put my money in, because for me 60k is a lot and it took a hell of a grind to save up. So when I do this, I want to do it right. My ETFs are the backbone of my portfolio. Stable and steady growth is the idea, allowing my money to compound. Next, BTC at 10% makes sense to me. I know it’s a volatile beast, but I’m not selling anytime soon, and I believe it has a solid future over the next decade. I can stomach the swings. Now, my individual picks are where I’ve received the most criticism, since I’ve been told I already have all these picks within my ETFs. I’m aware of this, and I trimmed it down to 15%. My thought process was choosing the companies I have the most faith in regarding their long-term growth to get above-average returns. I know this means I’m doubling down on American growth, and to be frank, I’m okay with that. Next is nuclear. I tried keeping it as small as possible, and I’m still thinking about trimming down URA, but nuclear is a bet I’m willing to take. I could talk for hours about why, but I’ll keep it short: I just think it’s ridiculous that the entry point is cheaper than solar when it has 1000x the potential. I also understand the massive risks, and if it goes to 0, I can stomach it. Overall, what do you guys think? Am I ready? All advice and criticism is welcome.",

      "selftext": "Recently I have been delving deeper into Micron Corporation particularly its business situation in terms of the demand for AI-driven memory and high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The management seems very confident, believing that HBM will remain in short supply for a long time to come and the demand for AI data centers has a structural difference from previous memory cycles. After going through a downturn, the prices of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND) seem to be stabilizing. From historical experience, this indicates the beginning of a recovery. Meanwhile the memory industry is always cyclical, and it is difficult to determine how much of this strong trend is truly driven by AI-driven demand and how much is just a normal inventory reduction rebound under supply shortages. For those who are interested in Micron (MU) or the memory market, what do you think are the truly important factors this time? Is it the allocation of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and whether long-term contracts can change the cycle, or do you still mainly focus on price and capacity expansion which were the key factors in previous cycles? I'm curious about how others view the current situation of Micron.",

      "selftext": "2025 was pure chaos ,half driven by AI hype, half by policy whiplash. We watched NVDA and GOOGL hold their thrones, while silver and names like SATS came out of nowhere with eye-watering 100%+ runs. Now heading into 2026, I feel like I’m at a crossroads: The AI trade: We’re clearly still in the early innings, but the focus has already shifted. It’s no longer just about chips ,the real opportunity is moving toward power grids, cooling solutions, and massive data center buildouts. The “boring” infrastructure that actually keeps AI running is becoming the core of the trade. The big rotation: Tech valuations are stretched, and that’s setting the stage for a rotation. With rates easing and new policies coming online, long-ignored sectors like banks, industrials, healthcare, and commodities are finally positioned to have their moment. How are you positioning for 2026? Staying heavy in AI infrastructure, rotating into value, or running a mixed strategy? What’s your highest-conviction play right now?",

We watched NVDA and GOOGL hold their thrones while silver and names like SATS came out of nowhere_with eyewatering 100 % runs . Now heading into 2026 I feel like I ’ m at a crossroads The AI trade We ’ re clearly still in the early innings but the focus has already shifted . It ’ s no_longer just about chips the real opportunity is moving toward power grids cooling solutions and massive data center buildouts . The “ boring ” infrastructure that actually keeps AI running is becoming the core of the trade . The big rotation Tech valuations are stretched and that ’ s setting the stage for a rotation . With rates easing and new policies coming online longignored sectors like banks industrials healthcare and commodities are finally positioned to have their moment . How are you positioning for 2026 Staying heavy in AI infrastructure rotating into value or running a mixed strategy What ’ s your highestconviction play right now"

      "selftext": "It's an age old question, and I'm invested in both. But I wrestle mentally with which is the better choice. Most of the time the comparison isn't apples to apples because RE is often bought with leverage whereas plain equities aren't. Most retail investors aren't managing leverage by rolling futures etc. But what if you want to leverage equities to the same extent as a RE investment, take into account financing terms, depreciation benefits, recapture, taxes, hedging strategies for equities drawdowns, and all the works! Which is the better choice. Here is a summary of such a discussion including assumptions and conclusions. Feel free to double check (easy w LLM) and/or roast the conclusion as much as you want in either direction. LETF (3x) Exposure: $100,000 Leverage cost: 2.5%/yr Dividend: 0.75%/yr Price appreciation: 28%/yr (UPRO) or 40%/yr (TQQQ) Tax rate: 40% short-term capital gains on all gains + 0% tax on dividend for simplicity (can include later) --made it STCG because one would likely need to institute some hedging to prevent catastrophic loss. Duration: 5 years Real Estate Property: $100,000 Down payment: 33% → $33,000 Mortgage: 67% → $67,000 Mortgage interest: 5.5% Accelerated depreciation (MACRS 5-year): assume ~20%/yr Rental income: 6% → $6,000/yr → taxed at 35% → $3,900 net Appreciation: 3% or 5%/yr Depreciation recapture: 25% of total depreciation Duration: 5 years Net Gain 3x LETF (UPRO, 28%) 149,050 3x LETF (TQQQ, 40%) 254,050 Real Estate (3%/yr, accelerated depreciation) 94,000 Includes rental + depreciation − recapture − interest Real Estate (5%/yr) 105,675 Looks like as long as you can manage market downturns, LETFs could possibly provide a better return under these assumptions.

Prof. Steve Hanke just gave everyone a massive reality check, and it’s cold: that **$3.5 trillion** surge in the M2 money supply is basically just physics what goes up has to come crashing down eventually. The logic in this market is getting insane. We still have the inflation monster running loose, and yet the Fed is already cutting rates? That’s like throwing jet fuel on a house fire. It feels like Wall Street has completely ditched fundamentals for pure **\"AI hopium.\"** It reminds me of those old cartoons: the Coyote has already run off the cliff, he’s just hovering there in mid-air, and the second he looks down and realizes there’s zero ground underneath him... it’s a straight up vertical drop. Seeing **TSLA** hit these levels makes me feel sick, not excited. Are we really telling ourselves \"this time is different,\" or is anyone else actually building a parachute?",

The logic in this market is getting insane . We still have the inflation monster running loose and yet the Fed is already cutting rates That ’ s like throwing jet fuel on a house fire . It feels like Wall Street has completely ditched fundamentals for pure AI hopium . It reminds me of those old cartoons the Coyote has already run off the cliff he ’ s just hovering there in midair and the second he looks down and realizes there ’ s zero ground underneath him ... it ’ s a straight up vertical drop . Seeing TSLA hit these levels makes me feel sick not_excited . Are we really telling ourselves this time is different or is anyone else actually building a parachute"

The overall structure is still incomplete. First, it must break through the strong resistance level of 102 with high volume. Secondly, to confirm the continued upward trend, it needs to break through 116. As I've said before, it generally follows Nvidia; NBIS is like a leveraged stock of Nvidia, and it surges whenever NVDA rises This rocket stock has more than doubled in less than a month from its low point. Next, I think the focus will shift to the AI ​​sector, and this rocket stock will take a break. NVDA is the most stable, NBIS is more aggressive, and AVGO is also a good option. AVGO already has a small leading diagonal pattern, and it should undergo a small second wave tonight before starting a larger upward trend",

So in this case I set a certain amount, lets say $2k. I split the amount in 3 parts and enter on red days within 1-2 weeks. In some cases if I see that stock it not doing well for 6-8 months, I may relocate funds to other similar stock with good fundamentals but may slightly oversold. I don't always follow my own rules, though. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it hurts 😁",

      "selftext": "Infy Adr 50% spike says... What infy adr spike said? Was it technical glitch? Was it Pump & Dump (just guessing)? Google says: Explanation of the Spike Technical Glitch: Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the 'INFY' ticker, potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive, self-reinforcing buy orders. Short Squeeze: Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers. The sudden, forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply. Low Liquidity: The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent, amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price. Key Takeaways Fundamentals Unchanged: Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement, confirming the company's fundamentals remained stable. Domestic Market Disconnect: The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market. The company's shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7% on the same day, reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly. Regulatory Scrutiny: The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity, prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC. Then why infy adr declining??",

What infy adr spike said Was it technical glitch Was it Pump Dump just guessing Google says Explanation of the Spike Technical Glitch Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the INFY ticker potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive selfreinforcing buy orders . Short Squeeze Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers . The sudden forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply . Low Liquidity The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price . Key Takeaways Fundamentals Unchanged Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no_material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement confirming the companys fundamentals remained stable . Domestic Market Disconnect The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market . The companys shares on the National Stock Exchange NSE in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7 % on the same day reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly . Regulatory Scrutiny The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC . Then why infy adr declining"

      "selftext": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words: AV disruption. As an Uber investor, it probably goes without saying, but I disagree and I’m going to show you why. The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios: 1. **The “In-House” Threat:** AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits. 2. **The “Squeeze” Threat:** As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won’t accept Uber’s take rates. I am going to address both of these, but let’s start with the crux of the point two: Uber’s Take Rate. # Understanding Uber’s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this: As AV companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Zoox scale, the power dynamic of the ride-share industry will shift. The fleet owner-operators, in order to earn a payback on their capex investments, will require a larger share of the pie. They will reject the \\~30% mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys. In essence, they will push Uber’s take rate down to 20% or lower, eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing, and in turn, jeopardizing the investment thesis. At a surface level, this is a valid concern. A drop in take rates from 30% to 20% looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber’s growth prospects. But Uber’s financials tell a complicated story: **not all revenue dollars are created equal.** When you dig into the unit economics, Uber’s top line is artificially inflated by “pass-through” costs. I don’t think many investors are aware of this, so I am going to break it down. The bottom line is this: A 20% AV take rate isn’t necessarily a negative impact. In fact, it might be a more profitable outcome for the company - a tailwind. # The “Cloudy” 30%: The Human Ride Uber’s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of \\~30%. Take rate is defined as Revenue / Mobility Gross Bookings. It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers. The thing is, a significant portion of the reported revenue is a pass-through. It isn’t money that Uber keeps. A huge chunk of every fare you see in the top-line revenue isn't revenue at all, it’s an **insurance premium.** Uber’s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue (which inflates the headline Take Rate), but they have to immediately set it aside in a \"loss reserve\" provision to pay for future accidents. The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “other” line of Cost of Revenue. Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “real” revenue is even smaller. Q3 Mobility Revenue of $7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $2.04b. That is a gap of $5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn’t exist in Uber provided AV rides. # The “Clean” 20%: AV Rides Now, let’s look at the economics of AV rides. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 80/20 revenue split, stating in a recent interview: []( \"…any player should take that 80% \\[revenue split\\], because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we're sitting in a very, very good place.\" While that headline number (20%) is lower than the current 30% mobility take rate, the cost structure is very different. 1. **No Insurance Liability:** The AV fleet owner (Waymo, etc.) carries the insurance on the asset. Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” for insurance drops to zero. 2. **No Driver Incentives:** You don’t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours. So, while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings, they keep a larger portion of the profit. # The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “Human Scenario” to a theoretical “AV Scenario” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber’s Q3’25 filings. To ensure a margin of safety, I used conservative assumptions. I estimated insurance costs at 28% of Uber’s revenue, and driver incentives at another 23%. These estimates are grounded in the $1.02B year-over-year jump in the \"Other\" cost line item (where insurance lives). In reality, Uber provisioned over $2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone, meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance. I ran two models: 1. **Conservative Model:** Adjusts only for insurance. 2. **Realistic “Less Conservative” Model:** Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc. **The results:** A 20% \"clean\" take rate from an AV ride-share is equal to or more profitable than a 30% \"cloudy\" take rate from a human. * In the **Human Scenario**, despite the 30% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” (what’s left after insurance, incentives, and processing) is roughly **$2.37 per ride**. * In the **AV Scenario**, with a 20% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” jumps to **$3.90 per ride**. **That is a \\~65% increase in profit per ride.** # The Utilization Arbitrage A 20% take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar, they need to generate at least 25% more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal. I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that. In a recent earnings call, management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “**more productive than 99% of human drivers.**” When you plug an AV into Uber’s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform. Uber’s service isn't as simple as matching riders to drivers, it is a complex logistical challenge. This is the value of Uber’s Marketplace Liquidity**.** Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen. Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips, providing AV cars with high-margin routes while offloading complex edge-cases to the human drivers. Without Uber, a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle: Uber estimates that “**in a typical large city, a fixed (AV) fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95% of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs**.” Uber’s platform provides access to demand driven by **189 million monthly active customers** and can maximize AV utilization. **If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25%, which I am confident they can, the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments.** This isn’t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet. Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business. Today, the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be **>$2.00 per mile**, which is comparable to the total cost of a human-driven ride, **before spending any money on customer acquisition.** Standalone operators face \"Demand Generation\" costs that can run into the **billions annually**. Uber has already done this. By partnering with Uber, AV operators pay a fee (20% take rate) for the elimination of this massive cost. # The Aggregator Thesis: Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market, Waymo or Tesla, I believe they are missing the most likely outcome: **fragmentation**. My thesis is simple: **AV hardware will be a commodity.** In 10 years, autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization. Whether the car is built by Tesla, Waymo, or Zoox won't matter to the rider. The only thing that matters to riders is **liquidity** \\- who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowest/most reasonable price? The answer is Uber. Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by the AV - it is going to aggregate it. # Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market. If one AV player dominates the market (a highly unlikely \"Winner Take All\" scenario for Waymo ), that provider gains pricing power over Uber. But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers (Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Tesla, Nuro, and others) Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on - access to the largest rider pool matters most. This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation. The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example. Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a **103% CAGR** through 2032. But what is more important for Uber, is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented. Now, I am not arguing there is no risk. The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales, the apps will fragment too, leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie. Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just **22% of US AV trips** in 2032, with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps. This is not an unreasonable assumption, I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via in-house apps as well. **But context matters**. This 22% share reflects the new and growing AV segment of ride-shares and does not account for Uber’s human-driver market. Even if Uber only gains 22% of the market, the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the **lower-cost of revenue** AV market, coupled with their core human drivers, is a net positive growth opportunity, not a existential crisis. Even so, I believe the 22% projection to be a bear-case scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber’s increased utilization. Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no single fleet operator gains leverage. Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy, repeatedly mentioning using \"Uber’s balance sheet\" to support AV partners. This is proactive and defensive capital allocation**.** Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it’s working. I am not arguing there is no AV risk. There certainly is. The next 1-3 years will be the defining period for this thesis. Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat. But if they do, the specific robotaxi brand won’t matter. Access to fast and cost-efficient rides is all that matters to the consumer. I’ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV, and they won’t mind paying an extra $1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides. # In Conclusion Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by AVs; it’s going to aggregate them. By trading “cloudy” high-take-rate mobility revenue for “clean” asset-light AV revenue, they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ride-sharing. **And we didn’t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats.** As Josh Brown (of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound) points out, we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4,000lb machines, an absurd model. The shift to small-scale AV robots (like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out) solves this inefficiency. Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment. The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs - wages and insurance for human drivers. AVs are a tailwind for Uber, not a major threat and the market refuses to accept that. **Disclosure**: I hold Uber stock. I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price. [](",

      "selftext_processed": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words AV disruption . As an Uber investor it probably goes without saying but I disagree and I ’ m going to show you why . The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios 1 . The “ InHouse ” Threat AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits . 2 . The “ Squeeze ” Threat As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won ’ t accept Uber ’ s take rates . I am going to address both of these but let ’ s start with the crux of the point two Uber ’ s Take Rate . Understanding Uber ’ s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this As AV companies like Waymo Tesla and Zoox scale the power dynamic of the rideshare industry will shift . The fleet owneroperators in order to earn a payback on their capex investments will require a larger share of the pie . They will reject the 30 % mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys . In essence they will push Uber ’ s take rate down to 20 % or lower eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing and in turn jeopardizing the investment thesis . At a surface level this is a valid concern . A drop in take rates from 30 % to 20 % looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber ’ s growth prospects . But Uber ’ s financials tell a complicated story not all revenue dollars are created equal . When you dig into the unit economics Uber ’ s top line is artificially inflated by “ passthrough ” costs . I don ’ t think many investors are aware of this so I am going to break it down . The bottom line is this A 20 % AV take rate isn ’ t necessarily a negative impact . In fact it might be a more profitable outcome for the company a tailwind . The “ Cloudy ” 30 % The Human Ride Uber ’ s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of 30 % . Take rate is defined as Revenue Mobility Gross Bookings . It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers . The thing is a significant portion of the reported revenue is a passthrough . It isn ’ t money that Uber keeps . A huge chunk of every fare you see in the topline revenue isnt revenue at all it ’ s an insurance premium . Uber ’ s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue which inflates the headline Take Rate but they have to immediately set it aside in a loss reserve provision to pay for future accidents . The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “ other ” line of Cost of Revenue . Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “ real ” revenue is even smaller . Q3 Mobility Revenue of $ 7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $ 2.04b . That is a gap of $ 5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn ’ t exist in Uber provided AV rides . The “ Clean ” 20 % AV Rides Now let ’ s look at the economics of AV rides . CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 8020 revenue split stating in a recent interview …any player should take that 80 % revenue split because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves . So economically were sitting in a very very good place . While that headline number 20 % is lower than the current 30 % mobility take rate the cost structure is very different . 1 . No Insurance Liability The AV fleet owner Waymo etc . carries the insurance on the asset . Uber ’ s “ Cost of Revenue ” for insurance drops to zero . 2 . No Driver Incentives You don ’ t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours . So while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings they keep a larger portion of the profit . The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “ Human Scenario ” to a theoretical “ AV Scenario ” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber ’ s Q3 ’ 25 filings . To ensure a margin of safety I used conservative assumptions . I estimated insurance costs at 28 % of Uber ’ s revenue and driver incentives at another 23 % . These estimates are grounded in the $ 1.02B yearoveryear jump in the Other cost line item where insurance lives . In reality Uber provisioned over $ 2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance . I ran two models 1 . Conservative Model Adjusts only for insurance . 2 . Realistic “ Less Conservative ” Model Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc . The results A 20 % clean take rate from an AV rideshare is equal to or more profitable than a 30 % cloudy take rate from a human . In the Human Scenario despite the 30 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” what ’ s left after insurance incentives and processing is roughly $ 2.37 per ride . In the AV Scenario with a 20 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” jumps to $ 3.90 per ride . That is a 65 % increase in profit per ride . The Utilization Arbitrage A 20 % take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar they need to generate at least 25 % more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal . I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that . In a recent earnings call management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “ more productive than 99 % of human drivers. ” When you plug an AV into Uber ’ s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform . Uber ’ s service isnt as simple as matching riders to drivers it is a complex logistical challenge . This is the value of Uber ’ s Marketplace Liquidity . Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen . Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips providing AV cars with highmargin routes while offloading complex edgecases to the human drivers . Without Uber a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle Uber estimates that “ in a typical large city a fixed AV fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95 % of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs. ” Uber ’ s platform provides access to demand driven by 189 million monthly active customers and can maximize AV utilization . If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25 % which I am confident they can the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments . This isn ’ t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet . Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business . Today the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be $ 2.00 per mile which is comparable to the total cost of a humandriven ride before spending any money on customer acquisition . Standalone operators face Demand Generation costs that can run into the billions annually . Uber has already done this . By partnering with Uber AV operators pay a fee 20 % take rate for the elimination of this massive cost . The Aggregator Thesis Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market Waymo or Tesla I believe they are missing the most likely outcome fragmentation . My thesis is simple AV hardware will be a commodity . In 10 years autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization . Whether the car is built by Tesla Waymo or Zoox wont matter to the rider . The only thing that matters to riders is liquidity who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowestmost reasonable price The answer is Uber . Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by the AV it is going to aggregate it . Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market . If one AV player dominates the market a highly unlikely Winner Take All scenario for Waymo that provider gains pricing power over Uber . But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers Waymo Cruise Zoox Tesla Nuro and others Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on access to the largest rider pool matters most . This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation . The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example . Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a 103 % CAGR through 2032 . But what is more important for Uber is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented . Now I am not_arguing there is no_risk . The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales the apps will fragment too leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie . Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just 22 % of US AV trips in 2032 with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps . This is not_an unreasonable assumption I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via inhouse apps as well . But context matters . This 22 % share reflects the new and growing AV segment of rideshares and does not_account for Uber ’ s humandriver market . Even if Uber only gains 22 % of the market the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the lowercost of revenue AV market coupled with their core human drivers is a net positive growth opportunity not_a existential crisis . Even so I believe the 22 % projection to be a bearcase scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber ’ s increased utilization . Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no_single fleet operator gains leverage . Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy repeatedly mentioning using Uber ’ s balance sheet to support AV partners . This is proactive and defensive capital allocation . Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it ’ s working . I am not_arguing there is no_AV risk . There certainly is . The next 13 years will be the defining period for this thesis . Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat . But if they do the specific robotaxi brand won ’ t matter . Access to fast and costefficient rides is all that matters to the consumer . I ’ ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV and they won ’ t mind paying an extra $ 1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides . In Conclusion Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by AVs it ’ s going to aggregate them . By trading “ cloudy ” hightakerate mobility revenue for “ clean ” assetlight AV revenue they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ridesharing . And we didn ’ t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats . As Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound points out we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4000lb machines an absurd model . The shift to smallscale AV robots like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out solves this inefficiency . Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment . The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs wages and insurance for human drivers . AVs are a tailwind for Uber not_a major threat and the market refuses to accept that . Disclosure I hold Uber stock . I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price ."

      "title": "Private credit markets are experiencing turmoil: Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance, and why is this a warning sign?",
      "selftext": "Global asset management giant Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance, adopting a series of strategies to address current market challenges. Apollo CEO Mark Rowan stated that the company's top priority is building the strongest possible balance sheet to ensure it is well-positioned to weather significant challenges in credit and equity markets. To this end, Apollo has taken three key measures: accumulating substantial cash reserves, deleveraging, and selling off high-risk debt assets. The rationale behind Apollo strategic shift lies in currently inflated asset prices, the unlikelihood of a significant long-term interest rate drop, and escalating geopolitical risks. Against this backdrop, Apollo has moved from aggressive investment to a conservative, defensive approach. First, Apollo has cleaned up its balance sheet, shifting to a \"cash is king\" model, reducing its exposure to AI-related loans and CIO risks, lowering leverage, and increasing interest rate hedging. These measures are setting a benchmark for the entire industry. This shift is not only Apollo response but also reflects the dual impact of deteriorating fundamentals and wavering confidence facing the private credit market. For example, last week, another large private equity firm, Blue Owl Capital, withdrew a $10 billion financing project due to risk concerns. Meanwhile, share prices of funds including KKR and BlackRock have plummeted, and bad debts have surged, indicating serious challenges in the credit market. Apollo defensive measures are being taken against the backdrop of a potential reckoning in the private credit industry. Mark Rowan has said that if you see one cockroach in the private credit market, it means there are likely more, suggesting he believes there is widespread systemic risk in the market. Despite the S&P 500 index rising nearly 15 percentage points this year, share prices of companies like FSKKR Capital and BlackRock's BDC have fallen sharply, and bad debt rates have surged. Competitors like Blue Owl Capital are still trying to address liquidity issues through mergers and acquisitions, but panic over valuation mismatches and redemption pressure is spreading in the market. In contrast, Apollo strategy of cleaning house early and accumulating cash reserves seems to be stockpiling resources for the coming economic downturn. Faced with this uncertain market environment, Apollo's conservative strategy appears particularly prudent and wise. As investors, we must maintain respect for the market at all times. With the end of the year approaching, allocating more funds to US Treasury bonds might be a good option for weathering the current economic climate, as US Treasury bonds are still considered a relatively safe investment in the current economic environment.",

Apollo CEO Mark Rowan stated that the companys top priority is building the strongest possible balance sheet to ensure it is wellpositioned to weather significant challenges in credit and equity markets . To this end Apollo has taken three key measures accumulating substantial cash reserves deleveraging and selling off highrisk debt assets . The rationale behind Apollo strategic shift lies in currently inflated asset prices the unlikelihood of a significant longterm interest rate drop and escalating geopolitical risks . Against this backdrop Apollo has moved from aggressive investment to a conservative defensive approach . First Apollo has cleaned up its balance sheet shifting to a cash is king model reducing its exposure to AIrelated loans and CIO risks lowering leverage and increasing interest rate hedging . These measures are setting a benchmark for the entire industry . This shift is not_only Apollo response but also reflects the dual impact of deteriorating fundamentals and wavering confidence facing the private credit market . For example last week another large private equity firm Blue Owl Capital withdrew a $ 10 billion financing project due to risk concerns . Meanwhile share prices of funds including KKR and BlackRock have plummeted and bad debts have surged indicating serious challenges in the credit market . Apollo defensive measures are being taken against the backdrop of a potential reckoning in the private credit industry . Mark Rowan has said that if you see one cockroach in the private credit market it means there are likely more suggesting he believes there is widespread systemic risk in the market . Despite the SP 500 index rising nearly 15 percentage points this year share prices of companies like FSKKR Capital and BlackRocks BDC have fallen sharply and bad debt rates have surged . Competitors like Blue Owl Capital are still trying to address liquidity issues through mergers and acquisitions but panic over valuation mismatches and redemption pressure is spreading in the market . In contrast Apollo strategy of cleaning house early and accumulating cash reserves seems to be stockpiling resources for the coming economic downturn . Faced with this uncertain market environment Apollos conservative strategy appears particularly prudent and wise . As investors we must maintain respect for the market at all times . With the end of the year approaching allocating more funds to US Treasury bonds might be a good option for weathering the current economic climate as US Treasury bonds are still considered a relatively safe investment in the current economic environment ."

      "selftext": "Since going public in 2021, Rocket Lab (RKLB) has seen its stock rise from around $10 to over $70 by 2025, representing a +600% return for early investors. However, it was 2025 that truly marked a turning point for the company. Over the year, Rocket Lab completed 21 successful launches of its Electron rocket, achieving a 100% success rate a critical milestone in the launch services industry. Following its final launch on December 21 (deploying the Japanese iQPS radar satellite), the stock rose by roughly 8%, approaching its recent highs around $77 per share (current price). In December 2025 alone, RKLB gained nearly 17%, driven by strong operational execution and growing expectations for 2026, particularly around the development of the Neutron rocket, designed for heavier payloads. I personally looked into using leverage via futures on tokenized versions of the stock through Bitget Onchain, but only large-cap names like NVDAon (NVIDIA), TSLAon (Tesla), and AAPLon were available. Rocket Lab is increasingly positioning itself as a credible challenger to SpaceX in the small satellite launch segment, supported by a growing backlog and expanding defense contracts. A key milestone was the $805 million contract awarded by the Space Development Agency (SDA) the largest in Rocket Lab’s history. According to Koontz, securing a contract of this scale reflects strong government confidence and suggests Rocket Lab could play a long-term role in U.S. space programs. From a strategic perspective, Rocket Lab benefits from deep vertical integration, controlling much of the value chain from manufacturing to launch services, while strengthening partnerships with institutional players such as NASA. These factors contribute to a durable competitive advantage against emerging rivals and position the company as a long-term beneficiary of both commercial and government-driven growth in the space economy. Personally, if Rocket Lab continues executing at this pace, I believe RKLB could still deliver attractive returns into 2026. That said, I’m open to opposing views feel free to comment if there are risks or negative factors I may be overlooking.",

      "selftext": "I have been paying attention to the artificial intelligence market recently and found that the impact of artificial intelligence on the U.S. economy is becoming more and more significant. Artificial intelligence investment continues to accumulate growth, and in the next few years, it may become a more important growth driver and key indicator. The influence of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more obvious. Although not all growth is due to artificial intelligence, its marginal effect is already quite significant, and its influence is penetrating into various industries, daily life, commerce, health care, transportation, education and industrial automation. Although the labor market has begun to weaken, it seems to be more like a normal adjustment of the employment market and a sign of the change of the times. Given that the artificial intelligence industry is dominated by a few key companies, even if there is a setback after overheating, the Bank of America also believes that its potential threats to the economy - including the impact on consumers and unemployment risks - are quite limited. Does this indicate that a new normal is coming? Why?",

Artificial intelligence investment continues to accumulate growth and in the next few years it may become a more important growth driver and key indicator . The influence of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more obvious . Although not_all growth is due to artificial intelligence its marginal effect is already quite significant and its influence is penetrating into various industries daily life commerce health care transportation education and industrial automation . Although the labor market has begun to weaken it seems to be more like a normal adjustment of the employment market and a sign of the change of the times . Given that the artificial intelligence industry is dominated by a few key companies even if there is a setback after overheating the Bank of America also believes that its potential threats to the economy including the impact on consumers and unemployment risks are quite limited . Does this indicate that a new normal is coming Why"

      "selftext": "Following a robust performance in 2025, market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026, with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential. Yet beneath this optimism, several factors warrant close attention. Valuations Hit Record Highs The S&P 500's valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble, reaching unprecedented levels. While the technology sector has been the primary driver, such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market. We are experiencing repeated volatility, and although high valuations pose resistance, these hurdles are not insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong. Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth, particularly pronounced in emerging markets. Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections, setting the bar exceptionally high. Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector, especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns. Sector Rotation: New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing, we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks. This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals. With technology stocks losing weight, cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention, while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments. Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year, January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks. As S&P 500 correlations decline, active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026, creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market. Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded, with investors brimming with confidence in equities, commodities, and economic growth. Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears. While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession, setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities. How do you view the market outlook for 2026? Will you remain committed to technology stocks, or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors?",

      "selftext_processed": "Following a robust performance in 2025 market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026 with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential . Yet beneath this optimism several factors warrant close attention . Valuations Hit Record Highs The SP 500s valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble reaching unprecedented levels . While the technology sector has been the primary driver such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market . We are experiencing repeated volatility and although high valuations pose resistance these hurdles are not_insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong . Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth particularly pronounced in emerging markets . Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections setting the bar exceptionally high . Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns . Sector Rotation New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks . This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals . With technology stocks losing weight cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments . Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks . As SP 500 correlations decline active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026 creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market . Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded with investors brimming with confidence in equities commodities and economic growth . Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears . While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities . How do you view the market outlook for 2026 Will you remain committed to technology stocks or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors"

      "selftext": "Nike closed around 57 dollars, sitting near multi-year lows after a sharp post-earnings selloff. The stock is now down more than 30% from its 52-week highs, significantly underperforming both the broader market and other consumer discretionary names. From a short-term trading perspective, this level is starting to matter. Most of the recent selling appears event-driven, and price is now consolidating near prior support. Momentum is still weak, but downside pressure looks slower compared to the initial drop. This is not a long-term thesis. Demand and margin concerns remain. But at current levels, the risk reward for a technical bounce is becoming clearer, especially if the broader market stays stable. I’m watching closely rather than rushing in. What do others think, short-term bounce here or still falling?",

      "selftext": "The U.S. third quarter growth not only surpassed the second quarter's 3.8% but also far exceeded market expectations of 3.3%. Following the data release, Treasury yields rose sharply while stock indices opened slightly lower. Tech stocks broadly declined. Market expectations now project the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 (down from three previous projections). This is a fascinating phenomenon! Ordinary people I've spoken with universally feel this year's economic conditions are poor, with employment and daily life proving challenging. Yet economic data, stock markets, and various asset performances all appear unrealistically strong. The devil is in the details. Data indicates that increased consumption by high income households was the primary driver of GDP growth (with substantially higher investment income being a key factor), while low and middle income families face hardships due to tariffs, employment pressures, and rising prices. Large corporations' massive investments in sectors like AI have boosted economic growth, yet small and medium sized enterprises continue to struggle. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the government shutdown will reduce fourth quarter GDP. I'd like to hear what opportunities everyone has identified and is sharing. Given the current situation, should we hold stocks through the holidays or lock in profits? Should we start planning ahead for next year?",

Market expectations now project the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 down from three previous projections . This is a fascinating phenomenon Ordinary people Ive spoken with universally feel this years economic conditions are poor with employment and daily life proving challenging . Yet economic data stock markets and various asset performances all appear unrealistically strong . The devil is in the details . Data indicates that increased consumption by high income households was the primary driver of GDP growth with substantially higher investment income being a key factor while low and middle income families face hardships due to tariffs employment pressures and rising prices . Large corporations massive investments in sectors like AI have boosted economic growth yet small and medium sized enterprises continue to struggle . The Congressional Budget Office projects that the government shutdown will reduce fourth quarter GDP . Id like to hear what opportunities everyone has identified and is sharing . Given the current situation should we hold stocks through the holidays or lock in profits Should we start planning ahead for next year"

      "title": "What is Value Investing? (VI according to Graham & Buffet)",
      "selftext": "**Hey everybody,** The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments, each with their problems and own struggles. It is impossible to grasp the whole nest/market. To navigate through this jungle, you can use different methods and strategies. You can buy meme stocks, you can pump and dump cryp\\*o, you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car. Today our focus is \"**drum roll**\" Value Investing. **Definition:** Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham (and David Dodd). It is a strategy to help (not a guarantee) find undervalued stocks. It focuses on safety and long-term gains. **Understand what you understand** Make sure that you understand which \"departments\" of the stock market you truly understand. Map it out for yourself, nearly everybody has an area of competence. Also, I recommend (like the book) sticking to it. You branch out over time or develop new areas, but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something. I like being pitched new ideas, but if they are outside my area of competence, I don't invest. You start looking for companies and find one; what next? **Analysis** The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis, which can be divided into 2 main parts: **Quantitative Analysis** (numbers) **:** It's numbers: P/E, P/B, earnings, etc. Most of you have this part down, no doubt. Also, there are enough tools today that can help you. This part is \"easy\". **Qualitative Analysis** (understanding the business): The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers, but it is as important, if not more important, than just \"numbers\". I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many. * Understanding the business and where the company is going: * What is the vision of the company, short-term/long-term? * What makes the company better than others: USP, patents, monopoly, etc.? * What are the struggles of the company? * How is the market in general? How future-proof is the company and the market? * What makes them future-proof? **Examples why you need both:** 1. Example: Quantitative: Perfect numbers. Qualitative: It is in the postal market, which will disappear (depending on the country) in the next 5-10 years. 2. Example: Quantitative: Mid numbers (fairly valued or even slightly overvalued). Qualitative: Developed a new CPU which will be market-disruptive. In conclusion, numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story! **How to find undervalued stocks?** This can be a very \"creative\" process. There's no blueprint for it; you need to look out, and everybody develops a different \"hunting method\". **Crisis:** The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind. Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down. **Looking where no one else is willing to look:** Michael Burry did \"anti-value investing\" by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption. **Personal note:** During the pandemic, my sister called me (she works for a global player) and told me that the \"good\" times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products. That sparked my interest. I started calling everybody I know from different sectors, and everybody had the same story: home office with Microsoft products. I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon, 2. Microsoft would make some good profit. I went all in and bought them for 136€ (20k) and sold later for 275€. My best to this day. **In conclusion:** there is no real strategy for that but a direction. DeepFuckingValue said it: It's more like a feeling you can't really describe. You are buying a company, not a stock! (Buffett) This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks, because you don't care how the stock performs today or tomorrow; you focus the most on the business side, and if this is going well, the stock will sooner or later follow. **General Advice:** **Be patient.** Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity, and he does it full-time! I take even much longer; therefore, I invest in an ETF. **Value investing** doesn't teach you only when to invest but also when to exit! Having an **exit strategy** is truly underrated (if you need bad examples, go to WSB lol). **VI is not for everybody:** If you don't have the matching personality, don't! Find one that matches your personality. Be honest with yourself. **Sparring Partner:** Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas. The wiser the better! Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with. I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice (of course, when they've bought already), and when I don't recommend it, they get pissed... **First DD:** I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it.

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everybody The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments each with their problems and own struggles . It is impossible to grasp the whole nestmarket . To navigate through this jungle you can use different methods and strategies . You can buy meme stocks you can pump and dump crypo you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car . Today our focus is drum roll Value Investing . Definition Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd . It is a strategy to help not a guarantee find undervalued stocks . It focuses on safety and longterm gains . Understand what you understand Make sure that you understand which departments of the stock market you truly understand . Map it out for yourself nearly everybody has an area of competence . Also I recommend like the book sticking to it . You branch out over time or develop new areas but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something . I like being pitched new ideas but if they are outside my area of competence I dont invest . You start looking for companies and find one what next Analysis The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis which can be divided into 2 main parts Quantitative Analysis numbers Its numbers PE PB earnings etc . Most of you have this part down no_doubt . Also there are enough tools today that can help you . This part is easy . Qualitative Analysis understanding the business The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers but it is as important if not_more important than just numbers . I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many . Understanding the business and where the company is going What is the vision of the company shorttermlongterm What makes the company better than others USP patents monopoly etc . What are the struggles of the company How is the market in general How futureproof is the company and the market What makes them futureproof Examples why you need both 1 . Example Quantitative Perfect numbers . Qualitative It is in the postal market which will disappear depending on the country in the next 510 years . 2 . Example Quantitative Mid numbers fairly valued or even slightly overvalued . Qualitative Developed a new CPU which will be marketdisruptive . In conclusion numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story How to find undervalued stocks This can be a very creative process . Theres no_blueprint for it you need to look out and everybody develops a different hunting method . Crisis The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind . Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down . Looking where no_one else is willing to look Michael Burry did antivalue investing by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgagebacked securities MBS . Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption . Personal note During the pandemic my sister called me she works for a global player and told me that the good times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products . That sparked my interest . I started calling everybody I know from different sectors and everybody had the same story home office with Microsoft products . I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon 2 . Microsoft would make some good profit . I went all in and bought them for 136€ 20k and sold later for 275€ . My best to this day . In conclusion there is no_real strategy for that but a direction . DeepFuckingValue said it Its more like a feeling you cant really describe . You are buying a company not_a stock Buffett This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks because you dont care how the stock performs today or tomorrow you focus the most on the business side and if this is going well the stock will sooner or later follow . General Advice Be patient . Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity and he does it fulltime I take even much longer therefore I invest in an ETF . Value investing doesnt teach you only when to invest but also when to exit Having an exit strategy is truly underrated if you need bad examples go to WSB lol . VI is not_for everybody If you dont have the matching personality dont Find one that matches your personality . Be honest with yourself . Sparring Partner Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas . The wiser the better Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with . I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice of course when theyve bought already and when I dont recommend it they get pissed ... First DD I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it . Did you know Waymo is owned by Alphabet ... AHHH READ THE FUCKING BOOK It has 600 pages I swear there is more written than PE ratio ... If you have questions feel free to ask . Side note I tried my best ."

      "title": "Why USA will see a new wave of inflation and how to benefit from it",
      "selftext": "The US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the total value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined. The total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We are increasingly borrowing to pay interest on existing debt. This adds more debt to the system and steadily worsens the cycle. The Fiscal Reality: The math is simple but the politics are nearly impossible. To materially reduce the deficit, the government would have to: Cut entitlements or defense. Politically untouchable. Raise taxes significantly. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, the average taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in additional federal taxes. With no credible path to balancing the budget, reducing the interest burden becomes the only realistic option. This creates strong incentives for lower rates and renewed liquidity support, even if inflation risks remain elevated. The Real Return Trap: The market, not the Fed alone, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation runs at or above nominal yields, bondholders earn zero or negative real returns. To preserve purchasing power, investors demand higher yields. That raises borrowing costs across the entire economy. Mortgages, corporate loans, and business investment all become more expensive regardless of policy intent. The Slower Growth Reality: Higher borrowing costs flow directly to consumers. Since consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of US GDP, this creates a structural drag on growth. More income is diverted to debt servicing, leaving less discretionary spending to fuel expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift. The Coming Shift: As the perceived risk free nature of US Treasuries weakens at the margin, capital will increasingly prioritize preservation. Over time, this favors markets with more sustainable debt levels and stronger fiscal trajectories. Moving before this adjustment becomes consensus may be necessary to protect real wealth.

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway remains a unique study in capital allocation and long-term value creation. Its diverse portfolio spans insurance, industrials, consumer goods, and equities, with a significant cash position that provides optionality in volatile markets. Given the company’s approach to underwriting float, share repurchases, and opportunistic acquisitions, I’m interested in discussing the fundamentals beyond the headline numbers. How are others modeling intrinsic value for Berkshire today? Are you focusing on normalized operating earnings, insurance float contribution, or the embedded optionality in publicly traded equity holdings? How do you weigh the potential upside from selective acquisitions against risks like interest rate exposure, regulatory constraints, or underperformance in cyclical segments? I’d also like to hear your thoughts on using metrics like adjusted book value, FCF yield, and ROIC as frameworks for evaluating the current attractiveness of BRK shares.",

Its diverse portfolio spans insurance industrials consumer goods and equities with a significant cash position that provides optionality in volatile markets . Given the company ’ s approach to underwriting float share repurchases and opportunistic acquisitions I ’ m interested in discussing the fundamentals beyond the headline numbers . How are others modeling intrinsic value for Berkshire today Are you focusing on normalized operating earnings insurance float contribution or the embedded optionality in publicly traded equity holdings How do you weigh the potential upside from selective acquisitions against risks like interest rate exposure regulatory constraints or underperformance in cyclical segments I ’ d also like to hear your thoughts on using metrics like adjusted book value FCF yield and ROIC as frameworks for evaluating the current attractiveness of BRK shares ."

Happened cuz regulations went nuts after Sarbanes-Oxley, small companies cant afford all the compliance crap. Private money is everywhere too, VCs and PE sitting on piles of cash so good startups just stay private forever. Big corps also scoop up the small public ones faster than new ones list. Now the huge growth happens behind closed doors. OpenAI talking raises that could hit 800B+ valuation, zero public shares. SpaceX already at 800B private. Same with Anthropic pushing 350B, Databricks 134B, all locked up. NVDA went public in 99 and retail could grab it dirt cheap, ride the whole way up. That doesnt happen anymore, the 100x part is private now. So hows retail supposed to get any edge these days? Secondary platforms, small cap hunting, venture funds if youre rich enough? Or we just stuck buying winners after they already 50xd private? What strategies you actually using? Serious answers only, skip the bitcoin jokes pls.",

Now the huge growth happens behind closed doors . OpenAI talking raises that could hit 800B valuation zero public shares . SpaceX already at 800B private . Same with Anthropic pushing 350B Databricks 134B all locked up . NVDA went public in 99 and retail could grab it dirt cheap ride the whole way up . That doesnt happen anymore the 100x part is private now .

      "selftext": "$GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection, with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never solved well: catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear. Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw, many of which currently have no routine screening, and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales. The addressable market is enormous, and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation, regulatory progress, and payer acceptance. From a growth perspective, the key drivers are FDA approval pathways, Medicare reimbursement, and employer or health system adoption. Each of those acts as a step function for volume, not a linear ramp. Once reimbursement is secured, testing can move from discretionary to routine, which changes utilization overnight. Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness, and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators. Near term, GRAL remains volatile and news driven, which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale. Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM - on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials, timelines, or commercialization strategy. This is not a value stock or a trade on multiples, it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected. If Galleri becomes standard of care, today’s valuation will look small in hindsight. #biotech #fuckcancer #cancerdetection",

The c fund is 100% stocks with the S&P 500.

My current retirement fund is the C fund with TSP and I would like to mirror those options with my Fidelity investment . Im just unsure which option to choose . The c fund is 100 % stocks with the SP 500 . Honestly I dont really know what Im doing when it comes to investing which is why I originally wanted them to do it for me I just know that my TSP has been doing well and historically it does do well over time"

      "selftext": "Does a \"perfect\" brokerage actually exist? I’m currently split between M1 and Robinhood and it’s a massive headache. I’ve reached the point where I’m spread too thin and tracking everything on a manual spreadsheet just to see my actual allocation, which sucks. **The M1 side:** I love the \"Pie\" setup for organizing my long-term stuff, but I’m over the trading windows and the way their auto-investing works. If one of my high-conviction stocks starts ripping, M1’s \"dynamic rebalancing\" basically stops buying it because it’s now \"overweight.\" I want my recurring buys to stay at the fixed % I set (e.g., if I set 10% to Apple, I want 10% of every deposit to go there regardless of the current price). **The Robinhood side:** The UI is obviously great and I love being able to set limit orders for flash crashes or just buy instantly. But managing a \"custom index\" of 15+ stocks on there is a nightmare. I don't want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month. Basically, I want: 1. M1-style Pies/Baskets (for organization). 2. Fixed-ratio DCA (every $100 deposit splits exactly how I set it). 3. Instant execution / No trading windows. 4. A UI that doesn't feel like it was built in 1995. I’ve looked at Public and Fidelity Solo Baskets but haven't pulled the trigger. Has anyone found a platform that actually hits all of these? Or a way to consolidate this without it being a second job?",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I currently use both M1 and Robinhood. I both like and dislike both for different reasons, there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds... right? **The problem statement:** I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFs/Stocks, but it doesn't allow for an \"Easy\" way to make my own \"pie\" that I can DCA into. I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or \"index\" that I DCA into on a recurring deposit, but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete, doesn't allow for fixed auto-recurring deposits (goes based off current weight relative to target weight), and some other restrictions. I love robinhood for index investing because the UI/UX is top-tier and I can just easily set recurring investments. I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis (certain price met, flash crash, etc...). I love M1 for making \"pies\" (basically my own index) that auto-invest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank. The issue is, between these platforms and stragegies, and other aspects of my financial situation, I've spread myself too thin. Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps, do calculations, track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I can't do it all in one place, etc.. Happy to hear others' experiences and would love any reccomendations, even if it's not a direct answer to my question!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all I currently use both M1 and Robinhood . I both like and dislike both for different reasons there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds ... right The problem statement I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFsStocks but it doesnt allow for an Easy way to make my own pie that I can DCA into . I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or index that I DCA into on a recurring deposit but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete doesnt allow for fixed autorecurring deposits goes based off current weight relative to target weight and some other restrictions . I love robinhood for index investing because the UIUX is toptier and I can just easily set recurring investments . I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis certain price met flash crash etc .... I love M1 for making pies basically my own index that autoinvest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank . The issue is between these platforms and stragegies and other aspects of my financial situation Ive spread myself too thin . Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps do calculations track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I cant do it all in one place etc .. Happy to hear others experiences and would love any reccomendations even if its not_a direct answer to my question"

The broader semiconductor group has been lagging AI “pure plays,” but memory names had been oversold relative to both Nvidia and the rest of the chip complex. Today’s strength suggests some rotation may finally be happening. There are a few catalysts behind this move: signs of improving memory pricing in channel checks, continued AI server demand, and technicals showing a break above short-term consolidation. MU isn’t cheap, but the market seems to be repricing the earnings outlook after digesting last quarter’s results. I’m thinking of holding and looking for disciplined pullbacks to add, not chasing at the top. Still curious whether this is the start of a sustained move or just relief in a choppy sector. What do others see in MU’s tape right now?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares in Paramount Skydance (PSKY) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) spiked Monday after Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle (ORCL), agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. >Paramount stock rose over 4%, while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5%. >In a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deal's financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discovery's board. Last week, the board rejected Paramount's offer in favor of Netflix's (NFLX) bid, arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line. >Paramount's announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or \"adversely transfer\" assets while negotiations remain open. >\"Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,\" David Ellison said in Paramount's press release. >\"Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice,\" he added. >Netflix stock fell over 1% Monday. >Warner Bros., led by media mogul David Zaslav, has become the target of a multi-round bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks. >In Paramount's previous proposal, which was rejected by WBD's board, David Ellison's company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition valued at $108.4 billion. >The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital would backstop \"100% of our equity commitments,\" or the $40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through, while Jared Kushner's investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to \"forgo any governance rights.\" Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid. >Larry Ellison's offer to personally backstop $40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. \"assert\\[ed\\] that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison,\" Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement. >Warner Bros.' mid-December rejection of Paramount's offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal, which would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division. Under Netflix's offer, the streaming giant, helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos, would bring Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, HBO, and HBO Max in-house. >Warner Bros.' other news, sports, and entertainment assets, in its \"global networks\" division, would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025. >However, that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns, already flagged by President Trump. A combined Netflix-Warner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity, according to data from JustWatch, which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares in Paramount Skydance PSKY and Warner Bros . Discovery WBD spiked Monday after Larry Ellison the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle ORCL agreed to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramounts proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Paramount stock rose over 4 % while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5 % . In a securities filing Monday morning Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellisons son David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deals financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discoverys board . Last week the board rejected Paramounts offer in favor of Netflixs NFLX bid arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line . Paramounts announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not_to revoke the trust or adversely transfer assets while negotiations remain open . Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD . Our $ 30 per share fully financed allcash offer was on December 4th and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders David Ellison said in Paramounts press release . Because of our commitment to investment and growth our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders as a catalyst for greater content production greater theatrical output and more consumer choice he added . Netflix stock fell over 1 % Monday . Warner Bros. led by media mogul David Zaslav has become the target of a multiround bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks . In Paramounts previous proposal which was rejected by WBDs board David Ellisons company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $ 30 per share allcash acquisition valued at $ 108.4 billion . The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinales RedBird Capital would backstop 100 % of our equity commitments or the $ 40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through while Jared Kushners investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to forgo any governance rights . Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid . Larry Ellisons offer to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. asserted that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement . Warner Bros. midDecember rejection of Paramounts offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflixs proposal which would see the streaming giant absorb WBDs streaming and studios division . Under Netflixs offer the streaming giant helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos would bring Warner Bros. film and TV studios HBO and HBO Max inhouse . Warner Bros. other news sports and entertainment assets in its global networks division would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025 . However that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns already flagged by President Trump . A combined NetflixWarner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity according to data from JustWatch which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department ."

      "selftext": "I've explained it once, but badly - if I don't collect my thoughts well in advance it's hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays. This post is the start of **my redemption ark (in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts)**, and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy \"LUNR tickets\" when it was trading at $8\\~ I've since then got an 800% gain on my options: [My position \\(not including the new one I just made\\)]( # It started with a message from a WSB discord user I'll forever love this dude, he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract, briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them. My initial thoughts were the typical \"yea right, buddy\" thoughts: * How do I know you're a mechanical/space/whatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA? * How can you be so sure, that they are the ones to get picked? * Have you even checked their financials? [My brain when I realized what I realized]( But then my ADHD-crippled-monkey inside my brain took over: * Wait, did you say only three companies selected? * Final stage of the contest? * Previous collaborations with NASA? * Wait, you told me that there's a probability two companies might make the cut? * $4.7Bln contract? This is a typical 'gambling' game, and every gambling game can be analyzed, simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge. You see I used to play poker, and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices. # Simple Gambling Math Note: To simplify the text and make it shorter, I'll denote probability as P(event). Imagine that you're playing a simple \"roll the 3-sided dice\" game. Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 1/3. Now say you're betting $1 on your favorite number and if you win, you get $1.5 back. You could calculate the EV (expected value) of this game by simply calculating: P(win) \\* amount(won) + P(loss) \\* - amount(loss) = your EV (of discrete probability) so in our sample game we have: 1/3 \\* $1.5 - 2/3 \\* $1 \\~= $-0,17 Roughly translated to human language -> In the long run, for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $0.17 If we can figure out how this \"LTV contract game\" is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not. # Monte Carlo Simulations Now here's what I was thinking, there's a lot of information out there, publicly available. That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision. So all I need to do is to \"define a game\" and the rules to play this game, run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability. Why do I need to do this? To be as independent as possible (and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way). **So this is the game:** You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end (1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked), you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability (random events). At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules you'll randomly select from the original set. At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule (/event) occurring (and you do so randomly). Run a lot of simulations -> assess conditional probabilities based on results, i.e.: **- P(LUNR win | IF 1 selected)** **- P(LUNR win | IF 2 selected)** Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering, space age boom, etc. everything slightly improving your odds. # Results Even if the chances that 1 company would've been selected, the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry (at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly \\~ 45c premium each). The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility, but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it, standard shares would just fall to a certain price. However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 1/2... meaning that it just didn't make sense \"not to play\" - even if you think they might lose. As of right now, if it wasn't made clear that 2 companies would get selected... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldn't pay off (or barely for that matter), mostly because the premiums are already high. However - NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies, to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in, making the calls still lucrative. Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning, further helping the \"narrative\" that this is a valuable play. **Trying to estimate a PT** The problem with companies such as LUNR is that it's increasingly hard to estimate a PT. One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap -> recalculating the price (it's not perfect, it's pretty inaccurate, but it gives you some kind of an estimate). If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $40 a share. I tend to use this number as \"the super-positive estimate\", I then take roughly 1/3 of it and declare it as the \"the super-pessimistic estimate\" .. i.e. $40 / 3 \\~= $13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $40/2 = $20 The middle ground is what I use as the \"average, regular estimate\" i.e. $30 \\----- So, rough estimates: **Super-positive estimate: $40+** **Average estimate: $30** **Pessimistic estimate: \\~$20** \\----- **Super-pessimistic estimate: $13.4** \\----- This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $12.5C. Current price - USD 16\\~",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive explained it once but badly if I dont collect my thoughts well in advance its hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays . This post is the start of my redemption ark in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy LUNR tickets when it was trading at $ 8 Ive since then got an 800 % gain on my options My position not including the new one I just made It started with a message from a WSB discord user Ill forever love this dude he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them . My initial thoughts were the typical yea right buddy thoughts How do I know youre a mechanicalspacewhatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA How can you be so sure that they are the ones to get picked Have you even checked their financials My brain when I realized what I realized But then my ADHDcrippledmonkey inside my brain took over Wait did you say only three companies selected Final stage of the contest Previous collaborations with NASA Wait you told me that theres a probability two companies might make the cut $ 4.7Bln contract This is a typical gambling game and every gambling game can be analyzed simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge . You see I used to play poker and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices . Simple Gambling Math Note To simplify the text and make it shorter Ill denote probability as Pevent . Imagine that youre playing a simple roll the 3sided dice game . Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 13 . Now say youre betting $ 1 on your favorite number and if you win you get $ 1.5 back . You could calculate the EV expected value of this game by simply calculating Pwin amountwon Ploss amountloss your EV of discrete probability so in our sample game we have 13 $ 1.5 23 $ 1 $ 017 Roughly translated to human language In the long run for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $ 0.17 If we can figure out how this LTV contract game is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not_ Monte Carlo Simulations Now heres what I was thinking theres a lot of information out there publicly available . That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision . So all I need to do is to define a game and the rules to play this game run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability . Why do I need to do this To be as independent as possible and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way . So this is the game You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end 1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability random events . At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules youll randomly select from the original set . At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule event occurring and you do so randomly . Run a lot of simulations assess conditional probabilities based on results i.e . PLUNR win IF 1 selected PLUNR win IF 2 selected Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering space age boom etc . everything slightly improving your odds . Results Even if the chances that 1 company wouldve been selected the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly 45c premium each . The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it standard shares would just fall to a certain price . However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 12 ... meaning that it just didnt make sense not to play even if you think they might lose . As of right now if it wasnt made clear that 2 companies would get selected ... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldnt pay off or barely for that matter mostly because the premiums are already high . However NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in making the calls still lucrative . Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning further helping the narrative that this is a valuable play . Trying to estimate a PT The problem with companies such as LUNR is that its increasingly hard to estimate a PT . One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap recalculating the price its not_perfect its pretty inaccurate but it gives you some kind of an estimate . If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $ 40 a share . I tend to use this number as the superpositive estimate I then take roughly 13 of it and declare it as the the superpessimistic estimate .. i.e . $ 40 3 $ 13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $ 402 $ 20 The middle ground is what I use as the average regular estimate i.e . $ 30 So rough estimates Superpositive estimate $ 40 Average estimate $ 30 Pessimistic estimate $ 20 Superpessimistic estimate $ 13.4 This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $ 12.5C . Current price USD 16"

More than double the S&P 500's return of 16.20% this year! In 2024, Reddit's Dark Horse thread picks also more than doubled the S&P 500! The Dark Horse Stocks mentioned in the thread returned 50.92% , and the S&P 500's returned 23.92% that year. I would like to pose the question again for 2026 and see if Wallstreetbets can beat the S&P 500 for the third year in a row. I will compile a list based on the most upvoted comments based on this thread and post results New Years Eve. What are your top Dark Horse Picks for 2026? Which stocks, that nobody thinks will do good, will do the best in 2026? Stocks that will rise from the dead and take us on a ride. Stocks that people count out. Stocks that are beaten down. Which stocks will make the biggest comebacks in 2026? Results as of 12/25/25: 1. RDDT : 299 upvotes 2. A S T S : 238 upvotes 3. NBIS : 227 upvotes 4. ONDS : 162 upvotes 5. AMZN : 154 upvotes 6.
