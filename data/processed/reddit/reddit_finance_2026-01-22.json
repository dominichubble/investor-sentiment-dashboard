      "selftext": "I have lost over five hundred thousand American dollars in the stock market. I want you to sit with that number. Let it wash over you. Let it enter your body. That's a house. That's several houses in Ohio. I have donated multiple homes to the market makers. They have not sent a thank you card. This is fine. I was losing money during the easiest bull run in human history. You people were buying stocks based on emoji sentiment and becoming wealthy. I was studying charts. I was doing \"research.\" I was \"being smart about it.\" Some of you have witnessed my posts over the years. A beautiful public decomposition. Each update a little more desperate. A little more creative with the cope. You watched a man slowly enter the wood chipper feet-first and narrate the experience. Thank you for being here. Thank you for your awards. They meant nothing but I did notice them. Here is something I learned about myself: when I lose money, I do not stop. I do not \"cut my losses.\" I look at the loss and I think \"what if I made this worse.\" And then I DO. Exposed to flame, I do not recoil. I lean in. I say \"more please.\" I say \"I can take it.\" I could not take it. The more I lost, the more deranged the plays became. This is what scientists call \"chasing.\" I was chasing. I was chasing so hard I lapped myself. I was running in circles in a burning building looking for the exit and the exit was just more fire and I said \"this is fine, fire is just fast air.\" I am 38 years old. I have spent a DECADE of my life watching lines go directions I did not want them to go. Ten years. Three thousand six hundred days of looking at a screen and seeing my net worth do a little dance and then die. I have aged like a president. I have the internal organs of a much older man. Last year, I reached what the philosophers call \"the bottom.\" I was suicidal. This is not a joke part. I was genuinely going to leave. I had made peace with it. The market had taken everything and I was going to let it have the rest. I started having panic attacks. Do you know what a panic attack is? It's when your body decides to simulate death for practice. Very helpful. Great feature. I could not sleep. I would lie in bed and my brain would calculate. Automatically. Without my permission. \"If you had sold there. If you had bought here. If you had simply done nothing. If you had simply been born a different person with different impulses. If you had simply not been you.\" The losses compounded in my skull. They grew. They multiplied. They became a whole civilization in there. A society of regret. Little regret people building little regret buildings. Infrastructure. Economy. The losses became MORE organized than I was. The truth is embarrassing so I'll tell it. I was googling ways to kill myself. Specifics. And the algorithm, in its infinite wisdom, decided to serve me an article about old folk tales where people who die by their own hand become trapped as spirits in the place they died. Forever. Exposed to the elements. Unable to leave. And my first thought was: \"that would be annoying.\" And my second thought was: \"what else did medieval peasants actually believe.\" Six hours later I had written eleven pages about bells and runners and men who chased sounds they couldn't name and I had not thought about my portfolio once. My brain found a loophole. The loophole was folklore. I am not okay but I am BETTER. I am standing. I am vertical. The market tried to put me in the ground and I said \"not today, I have to finish writing about the town that destroyed itself chasing a bell that meant nothing.\" So here is my gift to you, degenerate gamblers. My daily \"stock tips.\" They are folklore now. Warnings from the old world. Written by a man the market already killed. I am writing to you from the afterlife. It's quiet here. No charts. No tickers. Just me and the bell and the runners and the ones who learned to stay still. Read them. Heed them. Or don't. I am no longer in the business of telling people what to do with money. I am in the business of warning you about what happens when you chase every sound. Sometimes they are the same thing. In closing, I made a website. I'm not going to say what it is because this isn't an ad. It's just a place where a broken man posts folklore about financial ruin. If you google \"unhinged stock market folklore written by someone who should be institutionalized\" you'll probably find it. This is not financial advice. This is not even website advice.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have lost over five hundred thousand American dollars in the stock market . I want you to sit with that number . Let it wash over you . Let it enter your body . Thats a house . Thats several houses in Ohio . I have donated multiple homes to the market makers . They have not_sent a thank you card . This is fine . I was losing money during the easiest bull run in human history . You people were buying stocks based on emoji sentiment and becoming wealthy . I was studying charts . I was doing research . I was being smart about it . Some of you have witnessed my posts over the years . A beautiful public decomposition . Each update a little more desperate . A little more creative with the cope . You watched a man slowly enter the wood chipper feetfirst and narrate the experience . Thank you for being here . Thank you for your awards . They meant nothing_but I did notice them . Here is something I learned about myself when I lose money I do not_stop . I do not_cut my losses . I look at the loss and I think what if I made this worse . And then I DO . Exposed to flame I do not_recoil . I lean in . I say more please . I say I can take it . I could not_take it . The more I lost the more deranged the plays became . This is what scientists call chasing . I was chasing . I was chasing so hard I lapped myself . I was running in circles in a burning building looking for the exit and the exit was just more fire and I said this is fine fire is just fast air . I am 38 years old . I have spent a DECADE of my life watching lines go directions I did not_want them to go . Ten years . Three thousand six hundred days of looking at a screen and seeing my net worth do a little dance and then die . I have aged like a president . I have the internal organs of a much older man . Last year I reached what the philosophers call the bottom . I was suicidal . This is not_a joke part . I was genuinely going to leave . I had made peace with it . The market had taken everything and I was going to let it have the rest . I started having panic attacks . Do you know what a panic attack is Its when your body decides to simulate death for practice . Very helpful . Great feature . I could not_sleep . I would lie in bed and my brain would calculate . Automatically . Without my permission . If you had sold there . If you had bought here . If you had simply done nothing_If you had simply been born a different person with different impulses . If you had simply not_been you . The losses compounded in my skull . They grew . They multiplied . They became a whole civilization in there . A society of regret . Little regret people building little regret buildings . Infrastructure . Economy . The losses became MORE organized than I was . The truth is embarrassing so Ill tell it . I was googling ways to kill myself . Specifics . And the algorithm in its infinite wisdom decided to serve me an article about old folk tales where people who die by their own hand become trapped as spirits in the place they died . Forever . Exposed to the elements . Unable to leave . And my first thought was that would be annoying . And my second thought was what else did medieval peasants actually believe . Six hours later I had written eleven pages about bells and runners and men who chased sounds they couldnt name and I had not_thought about my portfolio once . My brain found a loophole . The loophole was folklore . I am not_okay but I am BETTER . I am standing . I am vertical . The market tried to put me in the ground and I said not today I have to finish writing about the town that destroyed itself chasing a bell that meant nothing._So here is my gift to you degenerate gamblers . My daily stock tips . They are folklore now . Warnings from the old world . Written by a man the market already killed . I am writing to you from the afterlife . Its quiet here . No_charts . No_tickers . Just me and the bell and the runners and the ones who learned to stay still . Read them . Heed them . Or dont . I am no_longer in the business of telling people what to do with money . I am in the business of warning you about what happens when you chase every sound . Sometimes they are the same thing . In closing I made a website . Im not_going to say what it is because this isnt an ad . Its just a place where a broken man posts folklore about financial ruin . If you google unhinged stock market folklore written by someone who should be institutionalized youll probably find it . This is not_financial advice . This is not_even website advice ."

Anterix (ATEX) is a deep-value play on Smart Grids' needs for critical radio frequency communication. \\*\\***As of writing, ATEX holds the exclusive nationwide license for the 900 MHz band, a specialised frequency critical for the multi-trillion dollar US grid modernisation**.\\*\\* The current market cap sits at approximately $473 million, with the spectrum pipeline valued at nearly $3B across 60+ potential utility customers. Financial filings reveal a pivot toward profitability, with the company reporting a stellar EPS of $2.86 and increasing projected cash proceeds to $100 million from the previous $80 million guidance. On a business metrics and stock mathematics level, there is a significant valuation gap and a debt-free balance sheet. ATEX currently trades at a trailing P/E ratio of 4.9x, a solid discount compared to the telecom industry average of \\~16x. This undervaluation is further apparent when considering the company’s $250 million authorised share repurchase program, which remains active through to September 2026. \\***As of the most recent filings, over $227 million remains on this authorisation - a figure representing nearly 48% of the company's total market capitalisation**.\\* This suggests that as Anterix continues to execute its monetisation strategy, it has the liquidity to significantly reduce its share count, effectively creating a buyback floor that amplifies per-share value as revenue from long-term utility contracts scales. From a technical and operational standpoint, the turnaround is validated by accelerating contracted proceeds and strategic de-risking. The company has moved from a development phase into an execution phase, evidenced by the $147 million in contracted proceeds already on the books and the launch of TowerX with Crown Castle to speed up utility deployments. The stock chart reflects this momentum; after bottoming in late 2025 near $18, ATEX has established a strong ascending channel, with current technical support firming up around $23.50 - $24.00. With $39 million in cash and zero debt, Anterix is positioned to navigate the lumpy nature of spectrum deals while waiting for the market to re-rate its share price toward a fair value consensus of $50 - $55, which aligns with conservative spectrum-valuation methodologies of \\~$0.40/MHz-pop. \\*\\*Wireless Company Valuation\\*\\* *Conservative* If one applies a conservative $0.40/MHz pop math to Anterix’s nationwide footprint: 2.0 Billion MHz-pops x $0.40 = $800 Million (Spectrum Value) Add: \\~$40M Cash + \\~$140M in Contracted Receivables. Subtract: liabilities/burn. Divide by: \\~18-19 million shares. This calculation results in a price per share in the $50 range *Bull* At (already in contract with SDG&E) $2/MHz pop, this valuation quickly shifts to $200-250/ps Entry: $23-26 Target: $65 LFG 🍀🥸",

Notably, this rally wasn't a market-wide one. It was driven by major AI and robotics companies, including Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, and Hyundai Motor Company. This is interpreted as a concentrated rally driven by increased global AI investment and momentum in the semiconductor market, rather than a general market uptrend. I'm curious to hear your thoughts.

      "selftext": "(I’m long on Nvidia and a dozen other major AI related stocks. I’m also in various S&P positions and funds. Just a disclaimer.) Congress is one step closer to gaining the authority to review artificial intelligence chip sales to China, a move likely to open a rift with the Trump administration over plans to let Nvidia Corp. sell its powerful H200 processors to the world’s second largest economy. A House committee focused on foreign affairs approved bipartisan legislation Wednesday that calls for arms-sale style congressional oversight of advanced AI chip exports. The text, endorsed by the panel’s Republicans and Democrats, would outright ban sales of Nvidia’s Blackwell chips to China for two years, codifying existing export controls into law. The bill marks a response to President Donald Trump’s decision last month to ease longstanding export controls on China, a move aimed at spurring adoption of American AI technology in global markets but one that drew strenuous objections from national security hawks in Congress. Trump’s approval for Nvidia’s H200 sales to Chinese customers was formalized by a new rule issued last week by the Commerce Department. The panel approved the bill by a 42-2 margin. It now heads to the House for a floor vote. The Senate has yet to release a companion version, but lawmakers there have introduced a separate bill that would effectively block H200 sales. Under the legislation, the administration would be required to notify Congress of advanced AI chip sales before they’re approved, giving lawmakers the power to review and block export licenses to China, Russia, Iran, and other adversaries through a joint resolution. The measure calls for allowing members of House Foreign Affairs and Senate Banking committees to see the numbers of chips up for export as well as the end-users buying them. It also creates a way for so-called “trusted” AI companies to receive license exemptions when sending chips to US allies and neutral countries, an approach commended by Microsoft Corp. executive Fred Humphries, and requires the administration to submit a strategy on its policy for maintaining the US lead in the AI race. Spokespeople for Nvidia didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.",

He did not give details of the deal. ------ Michael Brown, Senior Research Strategist, Pepperstone, UK: “Very predictable, I suppose, as we had been viewing this as an ‘escalate to de-escalate’ situation all along. Now that geopolitical risk has been dialed down by many notches, I’d expect that participants will re-focus on what remains a solid equity bull case, as seen by dip buyers already stepping in, while risks to the USD also tilt to the upside, as we again focus on the U.S. macro outlook, where risks tilt firmly to the upside.” ------- Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands: “It's positive that the path toward de-escalation has been taken and that the 10 percent import tariffs are off the table. Now it's important that the US, Canada, and Europe continue to work together within NATO to strengthen Arctic security and combat threats from Russia and China.\" -------- End of day: ​S&P 500: up 1.2%, ​Nasdaq 100: up 1.4%, ​Dow: up 1.2%",

Michael Brown Senior Research Strategist Pepperstone UK “ Very predictable I suppose as we had been viewing this as an ‘ escalate to deescalate ’ situation all along . Now that geopolitical risk has been dialed down by many notches I ’ d expect that participants will refocus on what remains a solid equity bull case as seen by dip buyers already stepping in while risks to the USD also tilt to the upside as we again focus on the U.S. macro outlook where risks tilt firmly to the upside. ” Prime Minister Dick Schoof of the Netherlands “ Its positive that the path toward deescalation has been taken and that the 10 percent import tariffs are off the table . Now its important that the US Canada and Europe continue to work together within NATO to strengthen Arctic security and combat threats from Russia and China .

      "selftext": "Hey guys, so I am trying to figure out the proper way to do a stock and bond balance. I am currently 24 and have a ROTH IRA that is at 15k and fully invested in VT. I am planning on adding bonds when I get to 40 or so. At 40 I am thinking to get to 10% bonds, then increase by 1% each ear until I am at 30% at 60. I know that is is best to have bonds in a traditional IRA and keep the ROTH 100% VT. The problem I've been thinking about is when I'm 40, lets say the ROTH is at 100k or something with me contributing the max each year. If I just start the bonds at that point in a traditional IRA, how could I get the traditional to 10K? I know you cannot transfer funds from a ROTH to traditional, and the contribution limit is around 7k shared between both of them. I was thinking maybe if I get a 401k(which I dont currently have) I could transfer that to a traditional with funds already in there. It would be nice to just immediately transfer 10% of the funds from VT to bonds, but this doesn't seem possible between a ROTH and traditional. This all seems like a headache. What is the best way to go about the bond and stock balance?",

I am planning on adding bonds when I get to 40 or so . At 40 I am thinking to get to 10 % bonds then increase by 1 % each ear until I am at 30 % at 60 . I know that is is best to have bonds in a traditional IRA and keep the ROTH 100 % VT . The problem Ive been thinking about is when Im 40 lets say the ROTH is at 100k or something with me contributing the max each year . If I just start the bonds at that point in a traditional IRA how could I get the traditional to 10K I know you can not transfer funds from a ROTH to traditional and the contribution limit is around 7k shared between both of them . I was thinking maybe if I get a 401kwhich I dont currently have I could transfer that to a traditional with funds already in there . It would be nice to just immediately transfer 10 % of the funds from VT to bonds but this doesnt seem possible between a ROTH and traditional . This all seems like a headache . What is the best way to go about the bond and stock balance"

      "selftext": "**The 30-year backstory** Japan's economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble. To restore the economy, Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere: slash interest rates to zero, then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds. This creates artificial demand that pushes yields (aka borrowing costs) even lower. It's a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket. And being able to print money to pay it back. It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world. 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact. That's quadrillion with a Q. It also opened up an obvious trade. If you can borrow money for free, and put it in something yielding 4, 5, 6%... you've found an infinite money glitch. Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills. This made them the largest holder of US treasuries, with $1.2 trillion. The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up. This worked great for thirty years until COVID. Governments were forced to print money en masse, and inflation finally arrived. Japan's playbook worked when inflation was dead. But when it finally came back and prices started rising, printing money would make it worse. So Japan has had to stop printing money, and raise rates. **The $1.2 trillion dollar question** So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up? Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4% for the first time in decades. For thirty years, Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield. Now they can get it at home. That $1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo. All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere. For thirty years, it went into Treasuries, tech stocks, everything. Now imagine it leaving. And that has markets on edge. **What's next?** I don't know how this shakes out. But when Ray Dalio talks about a \"changing world order,\" this is probably part of it. One of the global market's laws of nature, endless cheap Japanese money, is coming to an end. **Note:** I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation. By no means an expert, so let me know if I missed anything obvious.",

      "selftext_processed": "The 30year backstory Japans economy melted down in 1990 with the popping of a huge real estate and equity bubble . To restore the economy Japan pioneered the playbook central banks now run everywhere slash interest rates to zero then buy massive quantities of your own government bonds . This creates artificial demand that pushes yields aka borrowing costs even lower . Its a bit like your left pocket owing money to your right pocket . And being able to print money to pay it back . It let Japan run up the largest debt in the world . 1.3 quadrillion yen to be exact . Thats quadrillion with a Q . It also opened up an obvious trade . If you can borrow money for free and put it in something yielding 4 5 6 % ... youve found an infinite money glitch . Japanese investors plowed into US treasury bills . This made them the largest holder of US treasuries with $ 1.2 trillion . The rest went into tech stocks and anything else going up . This worked great for thirty years until COVID . Governments were forced to print money en masse and inflation finally arrived . Japans playbook worked when inflation was dead . But when it finally came back and prices started rising printing money would make it worse . So Japan has had to stop printing money and raise rates . The $ 1.2 trillion dollar question So the reason people are freaking out about Japanese bond yields being up Because Japanese bond yields have crossed 4 % for the first time in decades . For thirty years Japanese investors had to look abroad for yield . Now they can get it at home . That $ 1.2 trillion in US Treasuries starts to have a reason to head back to Tokyo . All that cheap Japanese money had to go somewhere . For thirty years it went into Treasuries tech stocks everything . Now imagine it leaving . And that has markets on edge . Whats next I dont know how this shakes out . But when Ray Dalio talks about a changing world order this is probably part of it . One of the global markets laws of nature endless cheap Japanese money is coming to an end . Note I wrote this as an exercise to help myself understand the situation . By no_means an expert so let me know if I missed anything obvious ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ ]( >The European Union's legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump. >\"Given the continued and escalating threats, including tariff threats, against Greenland and Denmark, and their European allies, we have been left with no alternative but to suspend work\" on the deal, said Bernd Lange, the chairman of the European Parliament's international trade committee. >\"Until the US decides to re-engage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation,\" no steps to move the deal forward would be taken, Lange said in a statement. >\"Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake,\" he added in a post on X. \"Business as usual impossible.\" >The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries, plus the U.K., with tariffs if they did not allow the United States to control Greenland. >The E.U. trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trump's golf club in Turnberry, Scotland. >The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U. at just 15%. The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year. >Some imports from the E.U., such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed. >In exchange for the lower tariff rate, the European Union, America's largest trading partner, would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States. This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27-country bloc. >The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U. was worth $1.5 trillion in goods and services annually, as of 2024. The U.S. imports more than $600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average, while Europeans buy more than $360 billion of U.S. goods, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative. >When the so-called \"Turnberry deal\" was first announced, the European Commission hailed its potential, saying it \"restores stability and predictability.\" >But all that changed with Trump's Saturday tariff threat. >\"In politics as in business, a deal is a deal\" Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"When friends shake hands, it must mean something.\" >During his own Davos speech, Trump said that the U.S. would not use force to seize Greenland. But he did not take his threat of a 10% tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table. >Lange, the E.U. trade official, held a press conference following Trump's speech and called the president's assurances about force in Greenland \"a small positive element.\" >Nonetheless, \"It's totally clear that with this 10%-25% \\[tariffs\\] pressure, he is really getting into a new quality of relation,\" said Lange. >As long as Trump's tariff threat remains in place, \"There will be no possibility for compromise\" Lange said. >On Thursday, leaders of the 27 E.U. countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trump's Greenland threats. >This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $110 billion, which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports, from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon. >Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the bloc's \"Anti-Coercion Instrument,\" a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.'s trade \"bazooka.\" >The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers. >These could include investment restrictions, the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies, the suspension of business licenses, and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone. >Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U. a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion, the trade bazooka has never been deployed before. >On Wednesday, Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The European Unions legislative body on Wednesday halted work on the formal approval and implementation of the trade deal it reached last summer with President Donald Trump . Given the continued and escalating threats including tariff threats against Greenland and Denmark and their European allies we have been left with no_alternative but to suspend work on the deal said Bernd Lange the chairman of the European Parliaments international trade committee . Until the US decides to reengage on a path of cooperation rather than confrontation no_steps to move the deal forward would be taken Lange said in a statement . Our sovereignty and territorial integrity are at stake he added in a post on X . Business as usual impossible . The announcement came after Trump on Saturday said he would hit seven European Union countries plus the U.K. with tariffs if they did not_allow the United States to control Greenland . The E.U . trade deal was reached in July during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Trumps golf club in Turnberry Scotland . The core of the deal was a cap on U.S. tariffs applied to most imports from the E.U . at just 15 % . The rate was among the lowest received by any trading partner last year . Some imports from the E.U . such as generic pharmaceuticals would have had all tariffs removed . In exchange for the lower tariff rate the European Union Americas largest trading partner would have lowered tariffs on some goods it imports from the United States . This would have helped American agricultural and industrial companies sell products into the 27country bloc . The total trading relationship between the U.S. and E.U . was worth $ 1.5 trillion in goods and services annually as of 2024 . The U.S. imports more than $ 600 billion in goods from the bloc each year on average while Europeans buy more than $ 360 billion of U.S. goods according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative . When the socalled Turnberry deal was first announced the European Commission hailed its potential saying it restores stability and predictability . But all that changed with Trumps Saturday tariff threat . In politics as in business a deal is a deal Von der Leyen said on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos Switzerland . When friends shake hands it must mean something . During his own Davos speech Trump said that the U.S. would not_use force to seize Greenland . But he did not_take his threat of a 10 % tariff starting Feb. 1 off the table . Lange the E.U . trade official held a press conference following Trumps speech and called the presidents assurances about force in Greenland a small positive element . Nonetheless Its totally clear that with this 10 % 25 % tariffs pressure he is really getting into a new quality of relation said Lange . As long as Trumps tariff threat remains in place There will be no_possibility for compromise Lange said . On Thursday leaders of the 27 E.U . countries will meet to discuss their coordinated response to Trumps Greenland threats . This may include a package of retaliatory tariffs worth nearly $ 110 billion which would impact a wide range of U.S. exports from Boeing airplanes to soybeans to Kentucky bourbon . Another potential retaliatory measure would be to deploy the blocs AntiCoercion Instrument a policy option sometimes referred to as the E.U.s trade bazooka . The ACI would allow the European Commission to target nearly any U.S. goods or services in Europe with a wide range of restrictions and barriers . These could include investment restrictions the lifting of intellectual property protections for American companies the suspension of business licenses and outright bans on market access to the Eurozone . Originally proposed in 2021 to give the E.U . a powerful set of tools to counter potential Chinese economic coercion the trade bazooka has never_been deployed before . On Wednesday Lange said he was in favor of putting the bazooka into use ."

      "selftext": "European lawmakers on Wednesday suspended the approval of the trade deal that the EU and U.S. agreed in July. In a statement on Wednesday, European Parliament member Bernd Lange, and INTA chair on EU-US trade relations, said the recent plans by President Donald Trump to impose tariffs of between 10% to 25% on European nations go against the terms of the trade pact. Referring to Trump’s address at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, Lange said: “I guess he didn’t revise his position. He wants to have Greenland as part of the United States as quick as possible.” In his speech, the president called for “immediate negotiations” on the acquisition of the Arctic territory. Trump ruled out the use of military force in his speech, a commitment Lange described as a “small positive element.” However, Lange said the proposed 10% to 25% tariffs remain on the table, adding that, until the threat of them is over, “there will be no possibility of compromise.” “We will hold on the procedure... until there is clarity regarding Greenland and the threats,” he said. Lange said Trump is “using tariffs as an instrument of political pressure” as a way to buy Greenland, and described the move as “an attack against the economic and territorial sovereignty of the European Union.” Politics aside, this is good for Equities market all around.

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I am a beginner trader/investor and lately I have been experiencing a lot of unnecessary risk and unrealized loss due to FOMO. The worst one so far for me has been with IBRX as I bought it yesterday as it was rising, making my average price of 7.11$. I realized my mistake too late after seeing the prices drop down to 6.5$ and at that point I just couldn't accept the loss so I didn't sell. In order to break out of this \"buy high sell low\" pattern, how should I approach buying a stock or an ETF? I know the general advice is to \"buy the dip\" but stocks, at least to me, seem to rarely drop considerably to be considered a dip. How do you approach buying or selling a stock? TL;DR: Beginner dummy making FOMO mistakes and looking to learn how to correctly buy and sell stocks and ETFs, alongside any other advice. Thank you for reading and have a nice day!",

      "selftext": "I keep hearing people compare Nvidia to Cisco Systems circa 1999. Bulls say Nvidia is different. Bears say it's the dot-com bubble all over again. I own 190 shares and here's my honest assessment. First, the bull case. Nvidia's real moat isn't just GPUs. It's CUDA. 4.5M developers vs 1.8M in 2020. That's an ecosystem Cisco never had. Cisco laid 'dark fiber', infrastructure nobody used. Nvidia's GPUs are powering real products generating real revenue. There are already 10 AI products over $1B ARR, 50 over $100M. Enterprise AI spending is $37B in 2025, up from $11.5B in 2024. That's 3x growth. The demand is real, not hypothetical as it was for Cisco. But the bear case is legitimate. At 50x P/E, Nvidia is priced for perfection. If hyperscaler capex peaks or competition emerges, the stock has a long way to fall. Google's TPU, Amazon's Trainium, Microsoft's Maia - all custom chips designed to reduce Nvidia dependence. If any succeed at scale, Nvidia's moat gets tested (although these are arguably a long way off). The wildcard is export controls. As a lawyer and former compliance officer at a big bank, I see something most overlook - the US govt plans to take 25% of Nvidia's China chip sales. They've literally crowned Nvidia as the winner. This creates a regulatory moat. The government has skin in the game. But it's also a risk because China has to play along (which they soon likely will) and policy could change overnight. But here's the valuation reality - Nvidia needs \\~$198B earnings by 2028 to justify current prices. In my newsletter, I break down various scenarios: Bull case (25%): doubles from here. Base case (50%): down \\~15%. Bear case (25%): down \\~65%.",

      "selftext": "So I've been watching Atlassian (**$TEAM**) stock for a while now and have personally decided to pull the trigger. If you don't know Atlassian, they're a software company who create productivity software and are massively used in the tech industry and in most companies that use Agile processes. Put it this way, I work in tech and the majority of companies I have worked in use Atlassian products, namely Confluence, Jira, Service desk and such. Also before anyone mentions it, the profitability of Atlassian is hidden because of SBC but this hasn't been a problem for the market in the past 5+ years. Plus they invest 30% in R&D! It has pulled back over 50% in the past year from its 52 week high of $326. The main reasoning for this is the insider selling, but this is just 10b5-1 plans which is expected... To counter this they currently have a $2.5b share buy back issued and I suspect they'll have more to come at these low prices. The other main reason is the AI fear. Why I think the stock will rise a lot from here: * AI replacing engineers is overhyped, so imo we won't be seeing less sales coming from this. If anything I think over the long term it will increase as more software products are desired and a bunch of mess from AI has to be cleaned up by real developers * AI being able to produce a product like Jira is even more overhyped/crazy. Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what you're doing, but thinking you can create a scalable, secure, production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy... * Deeply embedded in many companies - as I mentioned whether you like Confluence/Jira or not it is used in so many companies and won't be going anywhere * The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues * Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs * Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary: TEAM often trades at massive multiples (25x-40x Sales). Today, trading around **4.7x** **EV/Sales** with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies, 20%+ growth, and massive Free Cash Flow (FCF) margins. Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 6-24 months. Let me know what you think! Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS sell-off over?",

Its great for boilerplate code and basic apps if you know what youre doing but thinking you can create a scalable secure production ready application set like what Atlassian has with all of the regulatory compliance and such built in is crazy ... Deeply embedded in many companies as I mentioned whether you like ConfluenceJira or not_it is used in so many companies and wont be going anywhere The move away from self hosted to cloud based subscriptions is going to create even more revenue growth as the adoption continues Rovo their AI tool that will be integrated in the Atlassian eco system will add even more value once further adoption occurs Recent acquisitions will add further revenue Summary TEAM often trades at massive multiples 25x40x Sales . Today trading around 4.7x EVSales with a deeply entrenched moat embedded within thousands of large companies 20 % growth and massive Free Cash Flow FCF margins . Currently sitting at a multi year support level ready for its next explosive recovery and new all time high in the next 624 months . Let me know what you think Is the overhyped AI fear SaaS selloff over"

      "selftext": "President Trump said the U.S. wouldn't use force to acquire Greenland and was seeking negotiations on the acquisition of the territory, repeating his claim that only the U.S. is capable of defending it. In an address in Davos, Switzerland, he said the reason the U.S. needs to take control of Greenland is purely for security and has nothing to do with access to minerals. He opened his speech by saying Europe wasn't heading in the right direction, adding that “certain places in Europe are not recognizable” and criticizing the region's approach to energy. He also touted the successes of the U.S. economy, saying it was in the midst of the “most dramatic economic turnaround in history.” The speech came on the back of raised tensions between the U.S. and Europe over the president's designs on Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, with terse exchanges between officials at the Swiss gathering.

      "selftext": "Many of you know this but in the last century, money changed three times: 1. 1933-1934 During the Great Depression, the US government banned the ownership of gold. Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $20.67 per ounce. Shortly after people turned in their gold, the US government revalued gold at 35$ per ounce, effectively devaluing the dollar overnight. 2. 1944-1971 After World War II, a new system was created: the Bretton Woods system. The US dollar became the world's reserve currency, convertible to gold at $35 per ounce for foreign governments & central banks. Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars, while gold was stored in US government vaults. This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves. 3. 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely. Money was backed by trust, institutions and policy. Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods, the Federal Reserve’s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility. After Bretton Woods ended in 1971, those constraints disappeared, giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve (8 metric tons of gold) was accumulated before 1971, first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold. The same \\~8,000 tons of US gold were valued at \\~$5B in 1933, \\~$9B after the 1934 revaluation, and would be worth over $1.25T today at market prices. This lead to assets going up in value drastically. \\- Today gold is valued at $4,880 per ounce. That means the dollar has lost it's value 233 times to gold since the 1930s. \\- Equities performed very well, despite early volatility. The S&P 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7,000 recently (trading around 6,800 as I am writing this). \\- Real Estate compounded strongly. The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States (ASPUS - a statistic from FRED) went from $19,300 in 1963 to $512,800 in Q2 of 2025. \\- Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles, rising from roughly $1.50/oz in the early 1970s to \\~$95/oz today. \\- Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3$ per barrel in the early 70s to \\~60$ per barrel. Early stock markets were far more volatile than today. During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90%. Over time, owning productive businesses proved resilient not because volatility disappeared, but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules. Gold followed a similar path, from money to restricted asset, to restricted reserve and finally a long-term hedge against currency debasement. Today, digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process. Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply. Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value, settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain. How do you think monetary policy will evolve? Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution?",

      "selftext_processed": "Many of you know this but in the last century money changed three times 1 . 19331934 During the Great Depression the US government banned the ownership of gold . Citizens were required by law to turn in their gold for dollars at $ 20.67 per ounce . Shortly after people turned in their gold the US government revalued gold at 35 $ per ounce effectively devaluing the dollar overnight . 2 . 19441971 After World War II a new system was created the Bretton Woods system . The US dollar became the worlds reserve currency convertible to gold at $ 35 per ounce for foreign governments central banks . Most global trade and reserves were held in dollars while gold was stored in US government vaults . This system worked until foreign claims on US gold exceeded available reserves . 3 . 1971 The US ended gold convertibility entirely . Money was backed by trust institutions and policy . Under the gold standard and Bretton Woods the Federal Reserve ’ s ability to expand the money supply was constrained by gold convertibility . After Bretton Woods ended in 1971 those constraints disappeared giving the Fed far greater discretion to create liquidity Most of the US gold reserve 8 metric tons of gold was accumulated before 1971 first through domestic gold confiscation in the 1930s and later through foreign gold inflows under the Bretton Woods system as dollars were exchanged for gold . The same 8000 tons of US gold were valued at $ 5B in 1933 $ 9B after the 1934 revaluation and would be worth over $ 1.25T today at market prices . This lead to assets going up in value drastically . Today gold is valued at $ 4880 per ounce . That means the dollar has lost its value 233 times to gold since the 1930s . Equities performed very well despite early volatility . The SP 500 rose from 90 in the early 1970s to almost hitting 7000 recently trading around 6800 as I am writing this . Real Estate compounded strongly . The Average Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States ASPUS a statistic from FRED went from $ 19300 in 1963 to $ 512800 in Q2 of 2025 . Silver oscillated between monetary and industrial roles rising from roughly $ 1.50oz in the early 1970s to $ 95oz today . Oil repriced meaningfully going from 3 $ per barrel in the early 70s to 60 $ per barrel . Early stock markets were far more volatile than today . During the Great Depression equities fell nearly 90 % . Over time owning productive businesses proved resilient not_because volatility disappeared but because companies could adapt and reprice under new monetary rules . Gold followed a similar path from money to restricted asset to restricted reserve and finally a longterm hedge against currency debasement . Today digital assets exist alongside the traditional assets mentioned above and they appear to be at an earlier stage of that same maturation process . Bitcoin introduced a globally transferable asset with a hard capped supply . Whether this asset ultimately becomes a long term store of value settlement infrastructure or simply another category of risk asset is still uncertain . How do you think monetary policy will evolve Do you think digital assets have a part in this evolution"

      "selftext": "Looking at the cross-asset snapshot (SPY/QQQ down \\~2%, ARKK down more, BTC/ETH weak, long yields still elevated, and gold up hard), the message doesn’t feel like a clean “growth scare” or a clean “inflation scare.” It reads more like: the constraint is financing, and the adjustment is getting pushed into the places that can move fastest (risk premia, multiples, labor). A useful way to frame it is: stop asking “soft landing or recession?” and ask “where does the system externalize adjustment: prices, profits, or people?” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and still-meaningful financing rates, companies tend to defend mrgns first. This often means labor becomes the shock absorber (hiring slows, layoffs, wage pressure), while capex gets more selective, concentrated into productivity tech and “bottleneck control, not broad expansion. The non-obvious link here is the long end. When long yields stay firm while equities sell off, that’s not the market offering relief. It’s tightening the hurdle rate. That’s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn’t fall is interesting: it can be less “inflation hedge” and more “trust hedge/regime hedge.” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective, some things find bids, a lot of things don’t. **Quick asset paths (just how I’d map scenarios):** Gold: can keep working if stress is about confidence/term premium, even if stocks are weak. If yields actually roll over cleanly, gold can go sideways while risk re-rates. BTC: tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity + reflexivity. If the funding constraint persists, BTC can stay heavy; if policy/liquidity engineering shows up, it can move violently. ETH: usually higher beta than BTC, often needs “easy conditions” more. Watch ETH/BTC for whether liquidty is broadening. Tech companies like AMD/NVDA: caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity (duration). If yields stabilize/fall, multiples can re-rate fast; if term premium stays sticky, “good company, bad tape” can persist. If this is the right read, “solutions” probably don’t look like a simple Fed cut story. More likely it’s a mix of liquidity plumbing, debt management, and,or implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable. The trade-off is you don’t get a stable “everything rallies” regime, you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks.",

A useful way to frame it is stop asking “ soft landing or recession ” and ask “ where does the system externalize adjustment prices profits or people ” In a slowdown with high fixed costs and stillmeaningful financing rates companies tend to defend mrgns first . This often means labor becomes the shock absorber hiring slows layoffs wage pressure while capex gets more selective concentrated into productivity tech and “ bottleneck control not_broad expansion . The nonobvious link here is the long end . When long yields stay firm while equities sell off that ’ s not_the market offering relief . It ’ s tightening the hurdle rate . That ’ s also why gold ripping while the long end doesn ’ t fall is interesting it can be less “ inflation hedge ” and more “ trust hedgeregime hedge. ” This is the kind of tape where liquidity is selective some things find bids a lot of things don ’ t . Quick asset paths just how I ’ d map scenarios Gold can keep working if stress is about confidenceterm premium even if stocks are weak . If yields actually roll over cleanly gold can go sideways while risk rerates . BTC tends to trade like liquidity sensitivity reflexivity . If the funding constraint persists BTC can stay heavy if policyliquidity engineering shows up it can move violently . ETH usually higher beta than BTC often needs “ easy conditions ” more . Watch ETHBTC for whether liquidty is broadening . Tech companies like AMDNVDA caught between AI capex resilience and rate sensitivity duration . If yields stabilizefall multiples can rerate fast if term premium stays sticky “ good company bad tape ” can persist . If this is the right read “ solutions ” probably don ’ t look like a simple Fed cut story . More likely it ’ s a mix of liquidity plumbing debt management andor implicit yield management when volatility becomes unacceptable . The tradeoff is you don ’ t get a stable “ everything rallies ” regime you get dispersion and capital concentrating in whoever can fund themselves cheaply and control bottlenecks ."

Following recent news, and recent Trump administraion 'tendencies', I dont have a feeling of investing in the US anymore. The US find and have showed that they have unmatched power, they can do what they want. But without the rest of the world, being isolated, that power will be no more than just a bluff. I find it is the time to sell all my US stocks, leave the damn market, put that money into Europe, where there are still lots of great companies. I would like to hear opinions from Americans and Europeans as well. Edit: thank you guys for sharing the thoughts. Somebody judged that my thought is childish and emotional. Well, yes and no. It is not only that I am unhappy or mad at Trump and his fellows, it is more about showing to the US the resistance once they have stepped too far. Me alone is just a grain of sand, but with the many of Europeans or else where, it will not be an insignificant negative impact on the US market (which Trump cares very much). So hopefully, he realizes a borderline. But well, I am cashing out quite some portion of the US part, not completely yet. Hope to see a better US, with more respect from both directions.",

This year, some people have asked a great question: Why is the Trump administration going to Davos at all? Why show up and participate when we’ve been so clear that the old globalist line of thinking has been a disaster for America? >The answer is simple: we’re not going to Davos to uphold the status quo. We’re going to confront it head-on. >For far too long, the fate of the global economy has been decided by an international establishment who took America’s economic power and gave it to the rest of the world. Some of our past leaders believed the lies that offshoring was necessary, borders were not, and our national interest needed to submit to global lower cost of labour for the common good. That approach failed the US, crushed American workers and ripped apart most of the rest of the world as well. It destroyed industries, weakened supply chains and left working people in most western countries behind. ... >We are here at Davos to make one thing crystal clear: With President Trump, capitalism has a new sheriff in town. For decades, countries were told there was only one acceptable model. They were forced to depend on global supply chains and foolishly trust that global institutions would have their backs. That model put America dead last, and left countless others weaker as well. There's other crazy stuff in there like taking credit for the uptick in overseas stock markets. No mention of the Greenland/NATO stuff. EDIT: [FT now reporting]( that Lutnick got heckled and jeered at a Davos dinner last night, with some attendees walking out. It's going to be a messy day.",

He brushed off the recent market chaos caused by Trump’s threat to slap 10% to 25% tariffs on several European allies if they don’t help make the deal happen. Even though some international investors started dumping U.S. Treasuries in response, Bessent claimed the idea of a global selloff is just a false narrative. He insisted that U.S. debt is still the safest bet around and urged world leaders to stay cool while the administration focuses on shoring up national security.",

      "title": "Why Are People So Negative on HIMS? “No Moat” Argument Feels Overblown",
      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately, and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no moat and will get crushed by competition. I’m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic. Yes, telehealth is competitive. Yes, a lot of companies can sell ED meds, hair loss treatments, etc. But HIMS isn’t just standing still or doing the bare minimum. They’re rolling out at-home lab testing, expanding into menopause / perimenopause care, and even getting into peptides. Those are not trivial add-ons. I honestly haven’t seen many competitors offering at-home labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform. To me, the moat argument misses a few things: Ecosystem > single product. Someone who does labs + ongoing treatment + subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once. Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast. Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings, not late-stage commoditized stuff. Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare. I get the concerns around: Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro, Amazon, traditional healthcare, etc. But saying “no moat” feels lazy. Not every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it’s distribution, trust, brand, and integration. So I’m genuinely curious: Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance? Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company? Or is there something structurally broken here that I’m missing? Not trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder, more defensible areas, not easier ones. Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “competition bad.”",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing a lot of bearish takes on HIMS lately and the most common criticism seems to be that the company has no_moat and will get crushed by competition . I ’ m genuinely trying to understand this take because it feels overly simplistic . Yes telehealth is competitive . Yes a lot of companies can sell ED meds hair loss treatments etc . But HIMS isn ’ t just standing still or doing the bare minimum . They ’ re rolling out athome lab testing expanding into menopause perimenopause care and even getting into peptides . Those are not_trivial addons . I honestly haven ’ t seen many competitors offering athome labs at scale as part of a broader subscription health platform . To me the moat argument misses a few things Ecosystem single product . Someone who does labs ongoing treatment subscriptions is way stickier than someone buying generic meds once . Menopause care is massively underserved and growing fast . Peptides and personalized health feel like early innings not_latestage commoditized stuff . Brand matters more than people admit in healthcare . I get the concerns around Marketing spend Margins Competition from Ro Amazon traditional healthcare etc . But saying “ no moat ” feels lazy . Not_every moat is patents or exclusive tech — sometimes it ’ s distribution trust brand and integration . So I ’ m genuinely curious Is the negativity mostly about valuation and past stock performance Do people just lump HIMS in with every other telehealth company Or is there something structurally broken here that I ’ m missing Not_trying to pump — just trying to understand why sentiment is so bad when the company seems to be expanding into harder more defensible areas not_easier ones . Would love to hear real bear cases beyond “ competition bad . ”"

According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high: Copper prices jumped to an all-time high of $13,253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela, a key region for natural resources. • Critical minerals theme: According to market experts, metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order. • Impact of US Fed rate cut: The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities. • Supply-side concerns: Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sector-specific tariffs have added to positive sentiment. • Aluminium price rise: Aluminium prices also moved higher, driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong long-term demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy. In view of these factors, stocks like Vedanta, Hindustan Zinc, Hindustan Copper, Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest. Which is your fav stock at the moment?",

According to a report by tradebrains these are the reasons for the Metal Stocks Rally • Copper prices at record high Copper prices jumped to an alltime high of $ 13253.50 per tonne on the LME due to fears of supply shortages and rising uncertainty in Venezuela a key region for natural resources . • Critical minerals theme According to market experts metals like copper are gaining importance as countries focus on securing critical minerals and strengthening supply chains in the changing global order . • Impact of US Fed rate cut The December US Federal Reserve rate cut supported metal prices by improving liquidity and encouraging investment in commodities . • Supplyside concerns Ongoing worries about tight global supply and the possibility of additional sectorspecific tariffs have added to positive sentiment . • Aluminium price rise Aluminium prices also moved higher driven by a tighter supply outlook and expectations of strong longterm demand across industries such as infrastructure and energy . In view of these factors stocks like Vedanta Hindustan Zinc Hindustan Copper Hindalco are witnessing sharp buying interest . Which is your fav stock at the moment"

Most of it was received from my parents and grandparents, collected over time as gifts on special occasions such as birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries. My collection includes full silver cutlery sets (forks, knives, spoons) as well as jewelry, including bracelets, necklaces, rings, earrings, and chains. The silver, in its physical form, has a total combined weight of approximately 10 kilograms (≈320 troy ounces). If the market price of silver reaches $100 per ounce, one might think the total value would be $100 × 320 = $32,000. Are there ways to get closer to the full market (spot) price) for my silver?",

In advance, thank you for your time and ideas ! :) I have recently invested into 2 ETFs, one being the S&P 500 (ishares) and the other being MSCI Europe Value Factor (ishares). Both are ACC. Being in europe and following the tax code ACC would be better hence why the choice of ACC ETFs was made. The idea was being invested in the american market and also doing research shows it has had good and steady growth. And to also have a european market to be able to keep it diverse and not put all my eggs in one basket. I make monthly contributions to both with the split roughly being 75% into S&P 500 and the remaining 25% going into the MSCI Europe Value Factor. is this a good move or am i wasting time in the long run ? once again thank you for your time ! May your future endeavors.",

In advance thank you for your time and ideas I have recently invested into 2 ETFs one being the SP 500 ishares and the other being MSCI Europe Value Factor ishares . Both are ACC . Being in europe and following the tax code ACC would be better hence why the choice of ACC ETFs was made . The idea was being invested in the american market and also doing research shows it has had good and steady growth . And to also have a european market to be able to keep it diverse and not_put all my eggs in one basket . I make monthly contributions to both with the split roughly being 75 % into SP 500 and the remaining 25 % going into the MSCI Europe Value Factor . is this a good move or am i wasting time in the long run once again thank you for your time May your future endeavors ."

      "selftext": "I want this knowledgeable community to poke holes in my logic. I have stocks that have significant unrealized gains, and I have decent amount of cash. If I invest all the cash in VOO right now (close to ATH) and when market goes down, I sell VOO and buy VTI to maintain same exposure while harvesting tax losses against the significant realized gains *(yes, I will sell the stock with gains but won't have to pay any or as much tax)*. With this approach, I win if market goes up (VOO investment increases) and I win if market goes down (tax benefit). Here's an example - let's say I invested $2k in individual stocks and have $10k unrealized gain in those individual stocks (i.e. total $12k). Additionally, I have $20k cash I invest in VOO and if this $20k becomes $15k, I sell $15k VOO to get $15k VTI and $5k in TLH. Now when I sell the individual stocks, I get $12k and need to pay tax on $5k ($10k realized gain - $5k TLH). As a result, I scan invest $12k cash in individual stocks. What am I missing?",

      "selftext_processed": "I want this knowledgeable community to poke holes in my logic . I have stocks that have significant unrealized gains and I have decent amount of cash . If I invest all the cash in VOO right now close to ATH and when market goes down I sell VOO and buy VTI to maintain same exposure while harvesting tax losses against the significant realized gains yes I will sell the stock with gains but wont have to pay any or as much tax . With this approach I win if market goes up VOO investment increases and I win if market goes down tax benefit . Heres an example lets say I invested $ 2k in individual stocks and have $ 10k unrealized gain in those individual stocks i.e . total $ 12k . Additionally I have $ 20k cash I invest in VOO and if this $ 20k becomes $ 15k I sell $ 15k VOO to get $ 15k VTI and $ 5k in TLH . Now when I sell the individual stocks I get $ 12k and need to pay tax on $ 5k $ 10k realized gain $ 5k TLH . As a result I scan invest $ 12k cash in individual stocks . What am I missing"

      "selftext": "**TL;DR:** Hycroft Mining (HYMC) is sitting on what could be the largest undeveloped silver deposit in the United States. Eric Sprott has poured $200M+ into this stock in 6 months and averaged up on a 1000% gain position at 1.5billion dollars. # Part 1: The Asset — What Hycroft Actually Has **Old NI 43-101 Resource (2023):** \\- \"Low grade pit/moose pasture\" - Uneconomical to mine at low gold/silver spot prices, call options when spot rises - 10.5 million oz Gold - 400 million oz Silver - Location: Nevada, USA (fully permitted) **What's NOT in that number yet:** \\- Two new high-grade silver discoveries (Brimstone & Vortex) - Exploration drilling has 90-100% hit rate — every hole finds ore - Deposit is \"open in all directions\" — no boundaries found yet - Geophysics confirmed a 650m x 425m anomaly at depth (Feeder Zone) **Estimated High-Grade resource (coming in Q1 2026 MRE):** \\- 100-200+ million oz Silver at 400-500 g/t - For context: Cannington (world's largest silver mine) has \\~700 Moz lifetime production **Alex Davidson (VP Exploration) — What He's Seeing:** > **The Geology (Why This Matters):** |Features Seen|What It Means| |:-|:-| |**Argentotetrahedrite**|Primary silver mineral — coarse-grained, high-grade| |**Chalcopyrite throughout**|Copper sulfide — indicates magmatic source| |**IP Anomaly at depth**|Large-scale intrusive body = potential feeder zone| |**90%+ hit rate over 14 months**|Not random — continuous mineralized system| |**Open in all directions**|No boundaries found — deposit keeps growing| **Key Drill Intercepts (2025):** |Hole|Zone|Interval|Grade|Significance| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |H25D-6070|Vortex|31m|438 g/t Ag|Highest-grade continuous intercept| |H25D-6068|Vortex|169m|Mineralized|Remarkable continuous zone| |Brimstone 2024|Brimstone|21m|2,400 g/t Ag|Bonanza grades| # Part 2: The Billionaire — Eric Sprott's $200M+ Bet Eric Sprott made a billion dollars on Kirkland Lake's Fosterville discovery.

At 40% owner, he is the company and sees everything. # Part 3: The Timeline — Incoming Mineral Resource Update (MRE) **Management Guidance:** \\- \"Resource update coming out in the first quarter\" (Diane, Jan 20) - \"Two very significant silver discoveries not yet in our resource\" (Diane, Jan 20) **Expected MRE Release:** Jan 21-31 **What the MRE will likely show:** \\- 100-200 Moz High-Grade Silver (at 400+ g/t) - Separated reporting of High-Grade vs Low-Grade domains - \"Open in all directions\" exploration target statement **Government:** \\- Silver has been added as a critical mineral for solar, EVs, and military electronics - Hycroft is 100% US-based — no China/Russia exposure - DOE loan program or strategic reserve purchase could be announced # Part 4: The Catalysts — What's Coming |Catalyst|Timing|Impact| |:-|:-|:-| |MRE Update (High-Grade)|Jan 27-31|\\+50-100%| |Government Support Announcement|Q1-Q2 2026|\\+30-50%| |Pre-Feasibility Study|H2 2026|\\+20-30%| |Takeout Offer|2026-2027|\\+30%+| **The Development Path (If High-Grade Proven):** `HG MRE Confirmed → Starter Mine → Immediate Cash Flow → No Dilution → Funds $1B Processing CAPEX` |Step|What Happens| |:-|:-| |**1. HG MRE releases**|100-200+ Moz @ 400+ g/t confirmed| |**2. Starter mine approved**|Small open pit on Brimstone/Vortex (confirmed in interviews)| |**3. Heap leach oxide cap**|Quick cash flow from existing infrastructure| |**4. Revenue funds development**|Internal funding = no dilution| |**5. Build sulfide processing**|Roaster or POX facility for high-grade| **The Barrick Option (Why Takeover Makes Sense):** |Factor|Significance| |:-|:-| |**Barrick's Turquoise Ridge**|Next door in Nevada — literally across the fence| |**Under-utilized roasters**|Barrick has excess roasting capacity| |**HYMC's sulfide ore**|Perfect feed for Barrick's roasters| |**No new CAPEX needed**|Truck ore to existing facility| |**Eric's exit strategy**|He's done this before — position for takeout| **Bottom line**: If the high-grade is real, Hycroft either: 1. **Self-funds** with starter mine cash flow (no dilution), or 2. **Gets acquired** by Barrick who needs feed for their roasters Either path = massive upside from $45. # Part 5: The Shareholding Structure — Why There Are No Sell-Offs **Major Shareholders (SEC Filings):** |Owner|Shares|% Ownership|Type| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Eric Sprott (2176423 Ontario)|36,453,704|41.2%|Strategic| |Tribeca Investment Partners|6,615,366|7.9%|Institutional| |BlackRock Investment Management (UK)|6,000,000|7.4%|Institutional| |Schroder Investment Management|—|\\~%|Institutional| |Franklin Equity Group|—|\\~%|Institutional| |**Tier 1 Total**|—|**56.8%**|—| |Owner|Shares|% Ownership|Type| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Libra Advisors LLC|—|\\~%|Institutional| |APAC Resources Limited|—|\\~%|Institutional| |Regal Funds Management|—|\\~%|Institutional| |Helikon Investments Limited|—|\\~%|Institutional| |Other Institutional + Insiders|—|\\~%|Mixed| |**Tier 2 Total**|—|**24.9%**|—| |Summary|%| |:-|:-| |**Total Institutional Ownership**|**81.7%**| |**True Retail Float**|**\\~18.3%**| **Why This Structure Matters:** 1. **Sprott is Locked (41%)** — He can't sell, >10% owner means he has a 6 month lockup and selling any meaningful position will crash the stock. He's still buying. His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2. **BlackRock's 6M Share Position** — This isn't a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team. BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4% of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fund/client account. 3. **Tribeca (7.9%)** — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources. They're long-term holders, not day traders. 4. **81.7% Institutional** — Only \\~18% of shares are held by retail. When institutions own this much and none are selling, there's no supply. **The Price Dynamics:** |Factor|Effect| |:-|:-| |Low float (\\~30M shares)|Small buying pressure = big price moves (what we're seeing)| |Sprott adding, not selling|Largest holder is a buyer| |No short-term flippers|Patient, thesis-driven holders| **Why the Stock Doesn't Sell Off:** When a stock rises 13x (from $3.50 to $45), you normally see profit-taking. Not here. Why? * **Sprott's cost basis is \\~$5/share** — He's up 9x and still buying at $33. No exit pressure. * **Institutions bought for the takeover** — They're not selling before the a major is forced to buy # Part 6: The Risks |Risk|Mitigation| |:-|:-| |MRE disappoints|Eric's buying pattern suggests otherwise| |Metallurgical issues|Nov 2025 study showed 93% Ag recovery + potential roasting feasibility| |Commodity price drop|Silver has structural deficit (5 years)| |Execution risk|Diane has track record (built Romarco)| |Dilution|Higher stock = less dilution needed| # Part 7: Price Targets |Scenario|Share Price|Multiple from $45| |:-|:-|:-| |MRE Disappointment|$30-35|\\-20% to -30%| |MRE Meets Expectations|$70-90|1.5-2x| |MRE Beats Expectations|$100-130|2-3x| |Takeout (2026-2027)|$130-175|3-4x| # Positions \\-11k in shares, 50 in Feb 25$ calls, 45 in May 30$ calls Up: \\~+300k USD (Positions in SGD) [SGD - USD - SGD](",

Sprott is Locked 41 % — He cant sell 10 % owner means he has a 6 month lockup and selling any meaningful position will crash the stock . Hes still buying . His only exit is a full takeover which he always aims for in the past 2 . BlackRocks 6M Share Position — This isnt a passive index fund holding and rumoured to be Evy Hambro UK team . BlackRock actively chose to hold 7.4 % of a junior miner exploration on a conviction fundclient account . 3 . Tribeca 7.9 % — Australian hedge fund specializing in natural resources . Theyre longterm holders not_day traders . 4 . 81.7 % Institutional — Only 18 % of shares are held by retail . When institutions own this much and none are selling theres no_supply .

      "selftext": "I know most people on this subreddit are American and will continue to buy and hold US stocks no matter what. But I live outside the US and am not a US citizen. I'm in my late 20s and have been investing quite heavily in the stock market for the past 5 years. Around half of my portfolio is VOO, and the other half is made up of individual stocks, most of which are American companies like Nvidia, Google and AMD. I also own non-US stocks like BABA, BYD, LULU and a couple others, but those are a relatively small portion of my portfolio atm. I've made some decent returns, but lately, with all the crazy political stuff happening in the US, I don't really have confidence that America is a safe country to invest in anymore (please keep in mind that I'm not American so I have nothing tying me to the US). I think America is speedrunning its own collapse and doing everything it can to destroy decades worth of alliances and soft power. At any moment, Trump could decide to invade Greenland and all my US shares would freefall overnight, with no guarantee on how long it would take to recover. Even from a moral perspective, not even looking at profits, it doesn't feel right investing in US companies when the US is doing so much harm globally at the moment. All this is leading me to seriously considering selling all my US stocks and reallocating them towards either individual non-US stocks, or just investing in an ETF like VXUS. Would this be a smart decision given the fact that I'm not American and am more pessimistic than optimistic about the future of the US's role on the world stage? If not, what else can I do to minimize my risk as a foreign investor?",

      "selftext_processed": "I know most people on this subreddit are American and will continue to buy and hold US stocks no_matter what . But I live outside the US and am not_a US citizen . Im in my late 20s and have been investing quite heavily in the stock market for the past 5 years . Around half of my portfolio is VOO and the other half is made up of individual stocks most of which are American companies like Nvidia Google and AMD . I also own nonUS stocks like BABA BYD LULU and a couple others but those are a relatively small portion of my portfolio atm . Ive made some decent returns but lately with all the crazy political stuff happening in the US I dont really have confidence that America is a safe country to invest in anymore please keep in mind that Im not_American so I have nothing_tying me to the US . I think America is speedrunning its own collapse and doing everything it can to destroy decades worth of alliances and soft power . At any moment Trump could decide to invade Greenland and all my US shares would freefall overnight with no_guarantee on how long it would take to recover . Even from a moral perspective not_even looking at profits it doesnt feel right investing in US companies when the US is doing so much harm globally at the moment . All this is leading me to seriously considering selling all my US stocks and reallocating them towards either individual nonUS stocks or just investing in an ETF like VXUS . Would this be a smart decision given the fact that Im not_American and am more pessimistic than optimistic about the future of the USs role on the world stage If not_what else can I do to minimize my risk as a foreign investor"

      "selftext": "Sold 31 $25 2/20 $AXTI Cash Secured Puts (\\~31DTE). Why? Desperation. On December 1st, I moved apartments because my side and upstairs neighbors would alternate blasting music in the middle of the night. The leasing office and security did Jack shit. I was a pussy and didn't call the cops. So I just moved. Well here's the problem, in the beginning of January, someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place, and is stomping and jumping on the floor. I tried talking to them, but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump. Ok, not a problem, I can deal with this. except, now they do it in the middle of the night. I don't think they have a job, because I hear this at 1am and 9am alike. I spoke with the leasing office, and get this, the ceilings on the 1st floor units are thinner. when first I moved in, they phrased it as \"The first floor units have extra tall ceilings!\" 😭 Anyway, if AXTI is more than $25 on Feb 20th, then the 18.6k in premium would more than cover breaking my current lease, moving into a new apartment complex (ON THE TOP FLOOR THIS TIME), a new phone for my mom, and the Valve Steam frame for my homie who helped me though all this. oh and taxes of course. You might think this is stupid, and yes, it is, but I've been spiraling these past 6 months. The lack of sleep and constant headache in my old apartment did a number on my mental health. Then, management at my job was going to layoff my entire department, but turns out the new company that was to replace us, didn't have product knowledge. So, a few coworkers and I escaped the layoffs for now. And now, this new apartment upstairs neighbor situation is draining me. I was 170lb in September, I'm now 155lb from all this stress.",

      "selftext_processed": "Sold 31 $ 25 220 $ AXTI Cash Secured Puts 31DTE . Why Desperation . On December 1st I moved apartments because my side and upstairs neighbors would alternate blasting music in the middle of the night . The leasing office and security did Jack shit . I was a pussy and didnt call the cops . So I just moved . Well heres the problem in the beginning of January someone moved into the upstairs unit in my new place and is stomping and jumping on the floor . I tried talking to them but that caused them to stomp even harder and jump . Ok not_a problem I can deal with this . except now they do it in the middle of the night . I dont think they have a job because I hear this at 1am and 9am alike . I spoke with the leasing office and get this the ceilings on the 1st floor units are thinner . when first I moved in they phrased it as The first floor units have extra tall ceilings 😭 Anyway if AXTI is more than $ 25 on Feb 20th then the 18.6k in premium would more than cover breaking my current lease moving into a new apartment complex ON THE TOP FLOOR THIS TIME a new phone for my mom and the Valve Steam frame for my homie who helped me though all this . oh and taxes of course . You might think this is stupid and yes it is but Ive been spiraling these past 6 months . The lack of sleep and constant headache in my old apartment did a number on my mental health . Then management at my job was going to layoff my entire department but turns out the new company that was to replace us didnt have product knowledge . So a few coworkers and I escaped the layoffs for now . And now this new apartment upstairs neighbor situation is draining me . I was 170lb in September Im now 155lb from all this stress ."

      "selftext": "REPOST my fault Netflix is an absolute steal right now. NFLX is currently down 30+% over the last 3 months, and is currently looking to be down another 5% after the long weekend. NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don’t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years, but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth. First things first, NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company, with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report. I don’t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is. I just want to talk the politics. The big money maker? WBS The deal is happening. It’s very clear the deal is happening. WBS wants it, NFLX wants it, the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump, which I don’t see happening. Once this deal goes through, Netflix will have the monopoly. While every other entertainment company (YouTube, Insta, FB, TikTok, etc.) focus on short form entertainment. The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix, going all the way to production, not just rights to stream the movie. Netflix is just going to get bigger, and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again. Depending on when the deal goes through, I could potentially see NFLX rising 50% this year alone, and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years. I’m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix, keeping in MU until 400, and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note: Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term. Stranger things finale sucked ass = Lower Stock. I could potentially see it going as low as 75, but over the next year-2 NFLX will see explosive growth. Thoughts?",

NFLX is currently down 30 % over the last 3 months and is currently looking to be down another 5 % after the long weekend . NFLX has long been a consistent hold for investors that don ’ t look at this sub for its consistent growth throughout the years but this year and coming NFLX could very well have EXPLOSIVE growth . First things first NFLX is a very well ran and consistently growing company with share price still going down right now despite surpassing expectations in their recent report . I don ’ t need to go into specifics about how good Netflix as a company is . I just want to talk the politics . The big money maker WBS The deal is happening . It ’ s very clear the deal is happening . WBS wants it NFLX wants it the only thing potentially stopping it is Trump which I don ’ t see happening . Once this deal goes through Netflix will have the monopoly . While every other entertainment company YouTube Insta FB TikTok etc . focus on short form entertainment . The movie industry will essentially be entirely owned by Netflix going all the way to production not_just rights to stream the movie . Netflix is just going to get bigger and before this deal goes through is the absolute best price for NFLX shares you will ever see again . Depending on when the deal goes through I could potentially see NFLX rising 50 % this year alone and could see NFLX reaching 200 within 3 years . I ’ m putting most of my portfolio into Netflix keeping in MU until 400 and another decent amount in UUUU and POET Note Netflix is a pretty volatile stock short term . Stranger things finale sucked ass Lower Stock . I could potentially see it going as low as 75 but over the next year2 NFLX will see explosive growth . Thoughts"

Once you start design there you never really need to leave and new designers learn Figma first not Photoshop or Illustrator. That pipeline shift matters way more than people think Adobe has distribution and legacy sure but that can flip into a liability fast.

Today for example I was excited because my holdings in RZLV were up, I believe 8% at one point. Then they announced that they were issuing more shares of stock, and the stock crashed. Hard. Finishing the day down 23% (bastards...). The chart right up to closing time was heading down. BUT! Look at the stock price that it is trading at after hours, and it currently is UP 3.6%. Why?? Maybe Im wrong, but I seem to see this reversal in after-hours trading (and sometimes in pre-market trading as well) a lot. What happens in pre-market or after-hours trading that is different than a normal open market? How is it different? Why would their be these sudden reversals / movements? I guess related to that, is there any correlation in the direction of after-hours trading and the direction the stock is likely to move in on the following trading day?",

Why Today for example I was excited because my holdings in RZLV were up I believe 8 % at one point . Then they announced that they were issuing more shares of stock and the stock crashed . Hard . Finishing the day down 23 % bastards .... The chart right up to closing time was heading down . BUT Look at the stock price that it is trading at after hours and it currently is UP 3.6 % . Why Maybe Im wrong but I seem to see this reversal in afterhours trading and sometimes in premarket trading as well a lot . What happens in premarket or afterhours trading that is different than a normal open market How is it different Why would their be these sudden reversals movements I guess related to that is there any correlation in the direction of afterhours trading and the direction the stock is likely to move in on the following trading day"

In clinical trials treating late-stage prostate cancer patients, actinium-225 wiped out the cancer in three treatments. \"There is no residual impact of the prostate cancer. It's remarkable,” said Kevin John, a researcher at the Department of Energy's (DOE) Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). Actinium-225 and treatments derived from it have also been used in [early trials]( for leukemia, melanoma, and glioma. But something stood in the way of expanding this treatment. For decades, one place in the world has produced the majority of actinium-225: DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). Even with two other international facilities contributing smaller amounts, all three combined can only create enough actinium-225 to treat fewer than 100 patients annually. That's not enough to run anything but the most preliminary of clinical trials [ 1) Why don't US government speed up the approval for such drugs when the filing took place in June 2024?

      "title": "Why copper investors should stop thinking in single tickers",
      "selftext": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not the price chart, it is the physics. Advanced systems like radar, satellites, lasers, and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently, carry heat away from dense electronics, and maintain grounding and signal integrity. Copper is not always the active ingredient, but without it, reliability and performance fall apart. That helps explain why demand projections look sticky. You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 33-35 Mt by 2030 and potentially 50-55 Mt by 2050. Electrification adds copper intensity, and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb. Now connect that to stocks. A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently. A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution. A developer can move on permitting, capex clarity, and financing milestones. An explorer can move on targets and drilling, even without revenue. That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers. For producer exposure with different profiles, you could track Capstone Copper (TSX: CS, OTC: CSCCF), Lundin Mining (TSX: LUN, OTC: LUNMF), and First Quantum Minerals (TSX: FM, OTC: FQVLF). For the longer-cycle supply pipeline, Ivanhoe Mines (TSX: IVN, OTC: IVPAF) is a developer-style name people often associate with future copper supply. Then for pure optionality, keep Rumble Resources (CSE: RB, often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance) as the speculative end of the barbell. If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decade-plus to respond, do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline, or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names?

      "selftext_processed": "The most interesting copper angle right now is not_the price chart it is the physics . Advanced systems like radar satellites lasers and AI infrastructure are only practical at scale because copper can move power efficiently carry heat away from dense electronics and maintain grounding and signal integrity . Copper is not_always the active ingredient but without it reliability and performance fall apart . That helps explain why demand projections look sticky . You shared estimates that global copper demand could rise from around 25 Mt per year today to 3335 Mt by 2030 and potentially 5055 Mt by 2050 . Electrification adds copper intensity and AI data centers add another layer because power distribution and thermal management become the limiting factors as rack densities climb . Now connect that to stocks . A single ticker rarely captures the whole copper setup because different parts of the pipeline respond differently . A producer can benefit from price strength and operational execution . A developer can move on permitting capex clarity and financing milestones . An explorer can move on targets and drilling even without revenue . That is why I prefer a watchlist that spans risk layers . For producer exposure with different profiles you could track Capstone Copper TSX CS OTC CSCCF Lundin Mining TSX LUN OTC LUNMF and First Quantum Minerals TSX FM OTC FQVLF . For the longercycle supply pipeline Ivanhoe Mines TSX IVN OTC IVPAF is a developerstyle name people often associate with future copper supply . Then for pure optionality keep Rumble Resources CSE RB often shown as RB.CN on Yahoo Finance as the speculative end of the barbell . If the demand drivers are structural and supply takes a decadeplus to respond do you think the market starts rewarding the whole pipeline or does it still mostly pay producers and ignore the upstream names NFA ."

Reducing empty runs by even a few percentage points can swing millions in annual spend for large shippers.

      "selftext": "RIME’s recent move makes more sense when you treat it as a reclassification event. For a long time, the ticker was mentally filed under \"legacy junk\" and ignored. Once that mental label breaks, price can move fast because the market isn’t updating a price target, it’s updating a category. The numbers behind the new category are what matter. SemiCab’s deck points to enterprise-scale execution: about 173K loads run through the platform in a defined window, roughly 77% optimized, with around 11.7M miles removed and about $28.5M saved on roughly $340M of freight spend. That’s an 8%+ savings impact. Not theory. Then compare that to what the market is valuing the company at. With roughly 2.72M shares outstanding, even around the $0.80–$1.00 zone you’re talking about a market cap of only \\~$2.4M to $2.7M. That’s tiny relative to the scale implied by multi-million annual contracts and ARR discussion. That’s why the tape changed. When people stop thinking \"old business\" and start thinking \"logistics optimization with measurable savings,\" they stop selling dips and start buying them. Not advice, do your own reading.",

I am tired spending a tremendous amount of tired of researching a stock only to conclude that it is not worth it. In the meanwhile as i cannot find any decent store hold of wealth. Bonds yields are increasing faster then rates can keep up and my home currency is losing value. At the same time hard assets are either heavily taxed or require obscene fees to buy.

I am trying to find defensive equities but can not find any fairly priced onces . I am not_into ETFs cause I like to understand what i am buying . That is why i do so much research .

      "selftext": "Bloomberg) -- The Danish pension fund AkademikerPension is planning to exit US Treasuries by the end of the month, amid concerns that the policies of President Donald Trump have created credit risks too big to ignore. “The US is basically not a good credit and long-term the US government finances are not sustainable,” Anders Schelde, chief investment officer at AkademikerPension, told Bloomberg on Tuesday. AkademikerPension, which manages around $25 billion in savings for teachers and academics, held about $100 million in US Treasuries at the end of 2025, Schelde said. Risk and liquidity management is the only reason to remain in Treasuries, and “we decided that we can find alternative to that,” he said. Schelde cited Trump’s threats to take over Greenland as part of the reason to sell US Treasuries. But concerns about fiscal discipline and a weaker dollar also justify a retreat from US exposure, he said.",

Probably equal parts cash flowing real estate and US stock indexes with a bit of MAG 7 weighting, some EX-US exposure and a growing position in EU defense. Nice chunk of bitcoin and a small sliver of precious metals. but there’s a wad of cash getting eroded and I hate moving quickly about things. a friend said he’s sticking a bunch of his in Swiss Francs for now, which doesn’t seem crazy. I’m a little leery of gold given it’s at all time highs, but I suppose that’s justified given “full faith faith and credit“ of the US government is at all time lows... I don’t want to make some extreme bet that the US is cooked. But I need to do something and TIPS or CDs just don’t seem safe enough.",

      "title": "Grey Swan: Why the Rise in Japan 30 and 40 Year Bond Yield Will Cause Yen Carry Trade Unwind and Fuel a Global Financial Meltdown",
      "selftext": "# # Part I: The Political Detonator: The Takaichi Gambit and the 4% Barrier Since our last assessment, the \"Great Liquidity Era\" has entered a chaotic terminal phase. On January 19, 2026, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, Japan’s first female premier, shattered the remaining market calm by calling a snap election for February 8, 2026. This is not a standard political maneuver; it is a high-stakes referendum on \"proactive fiscal spending\" that has effectively declared war on the bond market. The Super-Long Yield Shock While the world was watching the 10-year JGB, the real carnage has moved to the \"back end\" of the curve. The 30-year JGB yield has ripped to 3.83%, while the 40-year yield has pierced the psychological 4.0% ceiling. This is a structural shift in the Term Premium. Investors are no longer just pricing in higher overnight rates; they are pricing in fiscal risk. The Takaichi administration’s proposal to cut sales taxes on food, estimated to cost the treasury 0.6% of GDP, has signaled to the world that Japan is opting for populism over solvency. The Mathematics of Maturity For thirty years, Japan’s debt was \"sustainable\" because it was pinned to a zero-bound. Today, that debt is being repriced at the speed of a high-frequency trade. * **The Yield Velocity:** The speed ($dy/dt$) of the move in the 30-year bond is now outpacing its G7 peers. * **The Duration Trap:** Because Japan’s debt has a high average maturity, these moves in the 30-year and 40-year yields are devastating. For every 10-basis point move in the super-long end, the \"mark-to-market\" loss on the Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) balance sheet and the portfolios of domestic \"lifers\" (insurers) is catastrophic. # Part II: The Policy Paradox: BOJ vs. Ministry of Finance We are now witnessing the \"Truss-ification\" of the Japanese Yen. The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has shifted from coordination to active sabotage. The MoF’s Debt Servicing Nightmare The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its \"assumed interest rate\" for the FY2026 budget to 3.0%, the highest in nearly three decades. At this level, Japan’s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen. > The BOJ’s Mandate of Thorns Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped. * To fight inflation (core at 2.6%), the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases (Quantitative Tightening). * To save the MoF, the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control (YCC) to cap the 30-year yield at 4%. However, if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus, the Yen collapses. If the BOJ allows yields to market-price, the MoF goes insolvent. They are no longer partners; they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nose-dive. # Part III: The Yen Carry Trade Unwind: The Great Repatriation The surge in the 40-year yield to 4% has changed the \"Internal Rate of Return\" (IRR) for Japan’s massive institutional investors. This is the \"Passive Structural Breach\" we feared. Japanese life insurers and pension funds, the world's largest \"whales\", no longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5% US Treasuries. When you factor in the cost of hedging USD/JPY volatility, a 4% risk-free return in their home currency (JPY) is mathematically superior to a 4.8% return in USD. The \"Infinite Money Glitch\" hasn't just stopped; it has reversed. The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese government's record-breaking interest bill. For thirty years, the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy: the Japanese Yen. It was the \"infinite money glitch,\" a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history. But yesterday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) did not just raise rates; they shattered the glass floor. With the 10-year Japanese Government Bond (JGB) yield finally piercing the 2.02% threshold, the \"Great Liquidity Era\" has officially met its end. As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape, I need you to understand that we are not just looking at a currency fluctuation. We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade. If you are not watching the Yen, you are flying blind into a hurricane. # I. The Architecture of the Glitch: 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990, Japan has been a laboratory for \"Extraordinary Monetary Policy.\" To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation, the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing (QE) and Yield Curve Control (YCC). By pinning JGB yields near zero, the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth. This birthed the Yen Carry Trade: investors borrow JPY at near-zero rates, sell it for USD, and buy high-yielding US Treasuries or high-growth Nasdaq tech. This was not just a trade; it was a systemic short-volatility bet. As long as Japan stayed \"frozen,\" the world had a \"BOJ Put.\" However, that era of artificial stability created a massive build-up of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge. # II. The Mathematics of the Shock: Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates. In the halls of institutional finance, we care about Velocity ($dy/dt$). The absolute yield matters for long-term solvency, but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival. The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return ($E\\_r$): $$Expected Return = Leverage \\* \\[ (Asset Yield - Japanese Funding Rate) + Currency Drift - Volatility Premium \\]$$ **Variable Breakdown** * **Leverage (L):** This is your Multiplier. Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash. They are typically levered 3x to 10x. This variable acts as a force multiplier, magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or, increasingly, for worse. * **Asset Yield:** Your Target Return. This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen, typically the US 10-Year Treasury yield or the S&P 500 earnings yield. * **Japanese Funding Rate:** Your Cost of Carry. This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen. As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5%, this cost eats directly into your profit margin, narrowing the \"spread.\" * **Currency Drift:** The Exchange Rate Delta. This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen. If the Yen appreciates, you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency. Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains. * **Volatility/Fear Premium:** The Risk Tax. This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added risk-premium required to hold the trade. When markets get jittery, this value spikes, often making the trade mathematically unviable for risk-managed funds before they even lose money on the interest rates. When JGB yields \"gap\" higher in a matter of days, the Value-at-Risk (VaR) models of every major bank go \"code red.\" This triggers an explosion in the $\\\\sigma\\_{fx}$ variable, causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse. The trade does not just stop; it unwinds. A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans, creating the Feedback Loop of Doom. # III. The Bridge to 2.5%: From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a \"Volatility Shock,\" which is a violent, short-term liquidation, a breach of the 2.5% JGB level represents something far more dangerous: a Passive Structural Breach. If USD/JPY reaches 170, the BOJ’s hand is forced. The cost of imported energy creates an \"Inflationary Breach\" that threatens social stability. To defend the currency, the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5%. Once yields pass 2.5%, the carry trade does not \"crash\" due to panic. Instead, it evaporates due to math. At 2.5%, the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero. Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a risk-free return in their own currency, creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets cannot replace. # IV. The Mechanics of the Unwind: The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds, it does not happen in a vacuum. It triggers a mechanical, cross-asset contagion. This is the \"Gravity\" phase of the cycle. * **The Treasury Sell-Off (The Initial Trigger):** As Japanese yields approach the 2.5% \"Death Zone,\" Japanese banks and insurers stop buying. To shore up domestic balance sheets, they begin selling their US holdings. This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit. * **The Result:** US 10-year yields spike toward 5.5% or 6.0%. * **The Equity Market Margin Call:** Most of the \"borrowed\" Yen is parked in high-beta growth stocks and crypto. As US Treasury yields spike, the discount rate for these equities rises, causing their valuations to compress. * **The Feedback Loop:** Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders. To pay back their JPY loans, they must sell more stocks. This selling forces them to buy back Yen, which makes the Yen stronger, making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back. * **The Liquidity Vacuum:** Because the Fed and BOJ are \"boxed in,\" there is no buyer of last resort. Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable. In this phase, the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0, and everything sells off at once. # V. The Boxed-In Reality: The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence. For decades, the US Federal Reserve acted as the world's ultimate Volatility Suppressor. Whenever the system shook, the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable. But today, the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction (MAD) framework. The BOJ is boxed in by the Yen's survival. If they do not raise rates, the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyper-inflation. If they do raise rates, they trigger a global margin call. **The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall. With US inflation remaining sticky, the Fed has lost its dampening powers. They can no longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation. The \"Volatility Suppressor\" has been unplugged.** # VI. Conclusion: The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct, catastrophic outcomes, but they both terminate at the same point: the liquidation of global leverage. * **The 140 Tail (Deflationary Spiral):** A sudden, violent surge in the Yen to 140. This is the \"fast-death\" scenario, which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world’s equities to pay back JPY loans. * **The 170 Tail (The Inflationary Breach):** This is the most likely path. As the Yen bleeds out to 170, the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5% to stop the hemorrhage. This causes the Passive Breach, which is the \"slow-death\" scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets, causing a relentless sell-off in Treasuries and equities. The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable. For the first time in the modern era, the Fed cannot print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency. Across the entire vector of assets, including equities, crypto, and private credit, the VaR is exploding. **Volatility is no longer being dampened; it is being amplified. The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent**. The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo. The detonator has been triggered, the fuse is burning, and 170 is the point of no return.",

      "selftext_processed": "Part I The Political Detonator The Takaichi Gambit and the 4 % Barrier Since our last assessment the Great Liquidity Era has entered a chaotic terminal phase . On January 19 2026 Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi Japan ’ s first female premier shattered the remaining market calm by calling a snap election for February 8 2026 . This is not_a standard political maneuver it is a highstakes referendum on proactive fiscal spending that has effectively declared war on the bond market . The SuperLong Yield Shock While the world was watching the 10year JGB the real carnage has moved to the back end of the curve . The 30year JGB yield has ripped to 3.83 % while the 40year yield has pierced the psychological 4.0 % ceiling . This is a structural shift in the Term Premium . Investors are no_longer just pricing in higher overnight rates they are pricing in fiscal risk . The Takaichi administration ’ s proposal to cut sales taxes on food estimated to cost the treasury 0.6 % of GDP has signaled to the world that Japan is opting for populism over solvency . The Mathematics of Maturity For thirty years Japan ’ s debt was sustainable because it was pinned to a zerobound . Today that debt is being repriced at the speed of a highfrequency trade . The Yield Velocity The speed $ dydt $ of the move in the 30year bond is now outpacing its G7 peers . The Duration Trap Because Japan ’ s debt has a high average maturity these moves in the 30year and 40year yields are devastating . For every 10basis point move in the superlong end the marktomarket loss on the Bank of Japan ’ s BOJ balance sheet and the portfolios of domestic lifers insurers is catastrophic . Part II The Policy Paradox BOJ vs. Ministry of Finance We are now witnessing the Trussification of the Japanese Yen . The dynamic between the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of Finance MoF has shifted from coordination to active sabotage . The MoF ’ s Debt Servicing Nightmare The Ministry of Finance has officially raised its assumed interest rate for the FY2026 budget to 3.0 % the highest in nearly three decades . At this level Japan ’ s debt servicing costs are projected to explode to over 31.3 trillion yen . The BOJ ’ s Mandate of Thorns Governor Ueda and the BOJ are trapped . To fight inflation core at 2.6 % the BOJ must raise the policy rate and reduce JGB purchases Quantitative Tightening . To save the MoF the BOJ would need to restart Yield Curve Control YCC to cap the 30year yield at 4 % . However if the BOJ caps yields while the MoF prints money for stimulus the Yen collapses . If the BOJ allows yields to marketprice the MoF goes insolvent . They are no_longer partners they are two pilots fighting for control of the same stick while the plane is in a nosedive . Part III The Yen Carry Trade Unwind The Great Repatriation The surge in the 40year yield to 4 % has changed the Internal Rate of Return IRR for Japan ’ s massive institutional investors . This is the Passive Structural Breach we feared . Japanese life insurers and pension funds the worlds largest whales no_longer need to hunt for yield in 4.5 % US Treasuries . When you factor in the cost of hedging USDJPY volatility a 4 % riskfree return in their home currency JPY is mathematically superior to a 4.8 % return in USD . The Infinite Money Glitch hasnt just stopped it has reversed . The trillions of Yen that fueled the Nasdaq and the US housing market are being pulled back to Tokyo to fund the Japanese governments recordbreaking interest bill . For thirty years the global financial system has operated on a hidden subsidy the Japanese Yen . It was the infinite money glitch a fountain of cheap capital that fueled the greatest bull market in human history . But yesterday the Bank of Japan BOJ did not_just raise rates they shattered the glass floor . With the 10year Japanese Government Bond JGB yield finally piercing the 2.02 % threshold the Great Liquidity Era has officially met its end . As your bored Ape in this shifting landscape I need you to understand that we are not_just looking at a currency fluctuation . We are looking at the potential structural failure of the global carry trade . If you are not_watching the Yen you are flying blind into a hurricane . I . The Architecture of the Glitch 30 Years of QE and YCC Since 1990 Japan has been a laboratory for Extraordinary Monetary Policy . To fight a demographic death spiral and entrenched deflation the BOJ pioneered Quantitative Easing QE and Yield Curve Control YCC . By pinning JGB yields near zero the BOJ effectively shorted its own currency to subsidize global growth . This birthed the Yen Carry Trade investors borrow JPY at nearzero rates sell it for USD and buy highyielding US Treasuries or highgrowth Nasdaq tech . This was not_just a trade it was a systemic shortvolatility bet . As long as Japan stayed frozen the world had a BOJ Put . However that era of artificial stability created a massive buildup of kinetic energy that is now beginning to discharge . II . The Mathematics of the Shock Velocity Over Levels The mistake most retail investors make is focusing on the absolute level of JGB interest rates . In the halls of institutional finance we care about Velocity $ dydt $ . The absolute yield matters for longterm solvency but the speed of the move matters for immediate survival . The carry trade is governed by the Expected Excess Return $ E_r $ $ $ Expected Return Leverage Asset Yield Japanese Funding Rate Currency Drift Volatility Premium $ $ Variable Breakdown Leverage L This is your Multiplier . Institutional carry trades are rarely executed with simple cash . They are typically levered 3x to 10x . This variable acts as a force multiplier magnifying every basis point of movement in the following variables for better or increasingly for worse . Asset Yield Your Target Return . This represents the yield of the asset you are buying with the borrowed Yen typically the US 10Year Treasury yield or the SP 500 earnings yield . Japanese Funding Rate Your Cost of Carry . This is the interest rate you pay to borrow the Yen . As the BOJ pushes yields toward 2.5 % this cost eats directly into your profit margin narrowing the spread . Currency Drift The Exchange Rate Delta . This is the percentage change in the value of the Yen . If the Yen appreciates you are forced to pay back your loan with more expensive currency . Even a small move here can instantly wipe out years of interest gains . VolatilityFear Premium The Risk Tax . This represents the cost of hedging your position or the added riskpremium required to hold the trade . When markets get jittery this value spikes often making the trade mathematically unviable for riskmanaged funds before they even lose money on the interest rates . When JGB yields gap higher in a matter of days the ValueatRisk VaR models of every major bank go code red . This triggers an explosion in the $ sigma_fx $ variable causing the Sharpe ratio of the trade to collapse . The trade does not_just stop it unwinds . A rapid spike in yields triggers a forced buyback of Yen to close out loans creating the Feedback Loop of Doom . III . The Bridge to 2.5 % From Volatility Shock to Passive Breach While a sudden spike in yields creates a Volatility Shock which is a violent shortterm liquidation a breach of the 2.5 % JGB level represents something far more dangerous a Passive Structural Breach . If USDJPY reaches 170 the BOJ ’ s hand is forced . The cost of imported energy creates an Inflationary Breach that threatens social stability . To defend the currency the BOJ must allow JGB yields to climb toward 2.5 % . Once yields pass 2.5 % the carry trade does not_crash due to panic . Instead it evaporates due to math . At 2.5 % the net spread between JPY borrowing and USD assets hits zero . Japanese institutional giants simply bring their trillions home to earn a riskfree return in their own currency creating a permanent exit of liquidity that global markets can not replace . IV . The Mechanics of the Unwind The Liquidation Feedback Loop When the yen carry trade unwinds it does not_happen in a vacuum . It triggers a mechanical crossasset contagion . This is the Gravity phase of the cycle . The Treasury SellOff The Initial Trigger As Japanese yields approach the 2.5 % Death Zone Japanese banks and insurers stop buying . To shore up domestic balance sheets they begin selling their US holdings . This floods the market with supply just as the US Treasury is trying to fund a record deficit . The Result US 10year yields spike toward 5.5 % or 6.0 % . The Equity Market Margin Call Most of the borrowed Yen is parked in highbeta growth stocks and crypto . As US Treasury yields spike the discount rate for these equities rises causing their valuations to compress . The Feedback Loop Falling stock prices trigger margin calls for carry traders . To pay back their JPY loans they must sell more stocks . This selling forces them to buy back Yen which makes the Yen stronger making the remaining JPY loans even more expensive to pay back . The Liquidity Vacuum Because the Fed and BOJ are boxed in there is no_buyer of last resort . Private credit markets freeze as the cost of capital becomes unpredictable . In this phase the correlation between all risk assets moves to 1.0 and everything sells off at once . V. The BoxedIn Reality The Death of the US Fed Volatility Suppressor We are witnessing the terminal phase of central bank omnipotence . For decades the US Federal Reserve acted as the worlds ultimate Volatility Suppressor . Whenever the system shook the Fed injected liquidity to dampen the Ofx variable . But today the Fed and the BOJ are trapped in a mutually assured destruction MAD framework . The BOJ is boxed in by the Yens survival . If they do not_raise rates the Yen collapses toward 170 and imports hyperinflation . If they do raise rates they trigger a global margin call . The Fed is boxed in by the Inflationary Wall . With US inflation remaining sticky the Fed has lost its dampening powers . They can no_longer suppress volatility because the very act of suppression now fuels the fire of inflation . The Volatility Suppressor has been unplugged . VI . Conclusion The Dual Tail Risk and the Inevitable Meltdown We are navigating two distinct catastrophic outcomes but they both terminate at the same point the liquidation of global leverage . The 140 Tail Deflationary Spiral A sudden violent surge in the Yen to 140 . This is the fastdeath scenario which is a mechanical margin call that liquidates the world ’ s equities to pay back JPY loans . The 170 Tail The Inflationary Breach This is the most likely path . As the Yen bleeds out to 170 the BOJ is forced to jack JGB yields to 2.5 % to stop the hemorrhage . This causes the Passive Breach which is the slowdeath scenario where Japanese capital is sucked out of US markets causing a relentless selloff in Treasuries and equities . The Yen carry trade unwind is now mathematically inevitable . For the first time in the modern era the Fed can not print its way out of a liquidity crisis without destroying its own currency . Across the entire vector of assets including equities crypto and private credit the VaR is exploding . Volatility is no_longer being dampened it is being amplified . The US Fed volatility suppression is now impotent . The trillions of Yen that once acted as global lubricant are being pulled back to Tokyo . The detonator has been triggered the fuse is burning and 170 is the point of no_return ."

      "selftext": "Posting this because the last few threads here were really insightful. Yields on Treasuries have been relatively high over the past few months, and some parts of the curve have even moved up. Yet, the indexes (S&P, Nasdaq) are still near highs. Historically, rising yields should put pressure on equity valuations through higher discount rates, but that doesn’t seem to be happening in full force. I’m curious how people here are thinking about this: 1. At what point do yields start to matter for stocks? 2.Is it the absolute level, the speed of change, or how long rates stay elevated? 3.Are you adjusting your view on risk when yields are high but leadership remains narrow? Not looking to predict a top or crash... just trying to understand how people mentally factor rates into equity risk, or whether most just ignore yields and focus on earnings and price action. Would love to hear how others here are framing it.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I don't own any individual stocks, and most of my investments are in growth mutual funds. I have some bond exposure in my 401k, but everything in my personal accounts is a mix between S&P500 (FXAIX), large cap growth (FSPGX) and semiconductor (FSELX.) I do realize there's quite a bit of overlap between these three mutual funds. Looking at the performance over the few years I've owned these, FSELX has blown everything out of the water by a large margin. Now I'm more inclined to invest a larger percentage of my money in FSELX. I realize we don't have crystal balls and we can't predict the future, but can you think of plausible scenarios where the semiconductor, microchip and AI sectors completely go bust? The more I look at the world around me, the more I'm convinced there's no plausible way, but I would love to hear your opinions. Many thanks in advance!! =)",

I have some bond exposure in my 401k but everything in my personal accounts is a mix between SP500 FXAIX large cap growth FSPGX and semiconductor FSELX . I do realize theres quite a bit of overlap between these three mutual funds . Looking at the performance over the few years Ive owned these FSELX has blown everything out of the water by a large margin . Now Im more inclined to invest a larger percentage of my money in FSELX . I realize we dont have crystal balls and we cant predict the future but can you think of plausible scenarios where the semiconductor microchip and AI sectors completely go bust The more I look at the world around me the more Im convinced theres no_plausible way but I would love to hear your opinions . Many thanks in advance"

I’d done 183 percent last year on AI stocks I sold out of completely like NBIS at 20$ during April. This is just the most ridiculous misplacing in an overpriced market. Now here’s the reason you need to be buying TTD. **Midterms.** If you take a gander at every time Trade Desk has massive earnings surprises to the upside it’s on political campaign years. TTD is at the same price it was at in June of 2020. The company is just getting destroyed but it’s also one of the most watched stocks currently on the market. Nobody wants TTD, sentiment couldn’t be worse. But watch as sentiment changes, everyone is bearish until just one positive happens with a company. At minimum you have an incredible margin of safety. If they kill earnings for two quarters at this price the forward PE goes from 18- to 12,13. And BTW TTD could implement their own AI system.",

      "selftext": "Russell 2000 hit an all-time high Friday and has now outperformed the S&P 500 for 11 straight days - longest streak since June 2008. **Whats driving this?** The thesis is straightforward.. stock prices track earnings growth over time. Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022, S&P 500 earnings have grown around 27% cumulatively, driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in mega-cap tech. Small-cap earnings over that period? Essentially flat. That equation is now reversing: * Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating.. +36.8% in 2024 down to +18% expected in 2025 * Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet: * S&P 500: +15% * S&P 400 mid-caps: +17% * S&P 600 small-caps: +19% * Russell 2000: +60% (includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive) **Why small caps specifically?** Small-cap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy - these companies have less international exposure. It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs. **The counter-argument:** Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade. The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multi-year range. Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift. **Also worth noting on precious metals:** Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling. Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries. However the gold/S&P 500 ratio is now sitting right at its long-term average - historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability (like 2008 or the early 80s inflation). 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here: [Redditr/dubapp]( Curious what everyone's thinking heading into earnings season 👇",

      "selftext_processed": "Russell 2000 hit an alltime high Friday and has now outperformed the SP 500 for 11 straight days longest streak since June 2008 . Whats driving this The thesis is straightforward .. stock prices track earnings growth over time . Since ChatGPT launched in late 2022 SP 500 earnings have grown around 27 % cumulatively driven largely by the AI buildout and concentrated in megacap tech . Smallcap earnings over that period Essentially flat . That equation is now reversing Nasdaq 100 earnings growth is decelerating .. 36.8 % in 2024 down to 18 % expected in 2025 Meanwhile earnings growth for the broader market is accelerating Looking at 2026 expectations per FactSet SP 500 15 % SP 400 midcaps 17 % SP 600 smallcaps 19 % Russell 2000 60 % includes companies currently unprofitable turning positive Why small caps specifically Smallcap strength historically signals investor confidence in the domestic economy these companies have less international exposure . It also suggests expectations for continued rate cuts since smaller companies tend to carry more leverage and benefit more from lower borrowing costs . The counterargument Small caps are notoriously volatile and have underperformed large caps for most of the past decade . The Russell 2000 only recently broke out of a multiyear range . Some argue this is just mean reversion rather than a durable trend shift . Also worth noting on precious metals Gold and silver have gone parabolic since last April with silver more than tripling . Central banks have been aggressively adding to gold reserves while diversifying away from Treasuries . However the goldSP 500 ratio is now sitting right at its longterm average historically for gold to continue outperforming from here would require either excessive stock valuations or global financial instability like 2008 or the early 80s inflation . 🗄️ Please see disclaimers here Redditrdubapp Curious what everyones thinking heading into earnings season 👇"

      "title": "My 2026 Picks: Stocks I feel are Undervalued",
      "selftext": "I've been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued, feel free to roast me or not, although I feel pretty secure about them. **1. Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)** * **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland. * **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs. **2. Ferrari ($RACE)** * **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth. * **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it. **3. Aston Martin ($AML)** * **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization. * **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside. **4. Fluor ($FLR)** * **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog, 82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance. * **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake. **5. L3Harris ($LHX)** * **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation. * **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core. **6. Capital One ($COF)** * **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through) * **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies. **7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)** * **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power & Light) attached to a high-growth tech play. * **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued feel free to roast me or not_although I feel pretty secure about them . 1 . Amaroq Minerals $ AMRQ Thesis Amaroq has successfully transitioned from explorer to producer recently beating FY25 gold production guidance . The real story is strategic The West is desperate to secure critical minerals GoldCopper outside of Chinese influence and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland . 2026 Catalyst The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026 . This boosts recovery rates to 90 % turning this into a cashflow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs . 2 . Ferrari $ RACE Thesis Stop looking at PE ratios this trades like Hermès not_Ford . The order book is entirely sold out through 2026 . Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth . 2026 Catalyst Lewis Hamilton ’ s second season in Red the imminent launch of their first EV . The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it . 3 . Aston Martin $ AML Thesis The contrarian pick . The stock has been battered creating a distressed valuation 0.4x sales . The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the Valhalla supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization . 2026 Catalyst If they deliver cars on time this year the stock rerates from bankruptcy risk to luxury brand . High risk massive potential upside . 4 . Fluor $ FLR Thesis Fluor has derisked its backlog 82 % of its contracts are now reimbursable meaning the client pays for cost overruns not_Fluor . They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the NuclearSMR renaissance . 2026 Catalyst Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale SMR stake . 5 . L3Harris $ LHX Thesis Unlike the slowmoving metal benders LockheedNorthrop LHX focuses on the highgrowth tech layer of defense space cyber and comms . They are the trusted disruptor in a sector seeing increased budget allocation . 2026 Catalyst The planned spinoff of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026 . This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner highermargin tech core . 6 . Capital One $ COF Thesis The play is the Discover acquisition . By owning the Discover network COF creates a closedloop system issuer network that lets them bypass VisaMastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin . Even without it it ’ s a techforward bank trading at a value multiple . 10 % CC Cap Highly Unlikely to go through 2026 Catalyst Realizing the projected $ 2.7B in synergies . 7 . NextEra Energy $ NEE Thesis AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity . NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale 30GW backlog to power the AI boom . You get the safety of a regulated utility Florida Power Light attached to a highgrowth tech play . 2026 Catalyst Confirmed 10 % dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers GoogleMicrosoft signing longterm power purchase agreements ."

      "title": "Gold & Silver: still safe havens, or already overbought?",
      "selftext": "I’m not usually a metals investor. I mostly stick to equities, ETFs, and some crypto. But given the current political and macro backdrop, I’m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk. Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks. Gold is trading around $4,675–$4,690/oz, up roughly +1.8% to +1.9% today, while silver is near $94/oz, up +5% to +6.6% today. Silver has been especially volatile, up about +25% YTD (2026) and roughly +200% over the past year. From a macro perspective, this looks like a classic **safe-haven rally**, driven by several overlapping factors: * **Geopolitical tensions**: renewed trade-war risks, US–Europe tariff threats, and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets. * **Macro uncertainty**: a weaker US dollar, uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts, persistent inflation, and rising global debt levels. * **Central bank behavior**: continued strong gold purchases, especially from China, as part of reserve diversification. * **Silver-specific dynamics**: rising industrial demand (electrification, AI infrastructure, crypto-related hardware), structural supply deficits, export restrictions, and its classification as a critical mineral in the US. Some analysts (Citi, JPMorgan) are talking about **$5,000 gold** and **$100 silver** into 2026, though that obviously comes with downside risks. A pullback from profit-taking seems very possible after such a sharp move, even if the broader trend remains bullish. I’m personally conflicted. On one hand, this feels late in the move. On the other, if the political and macro situation deteriorates further, not having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio. I’m not looking at physical metals, but rather trading exposure, which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk. That said, I’m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto. Even crypto platforms, Bitget, for example, now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products, which I’ve already tested from a trading perspective. Execution is fast and fees are low. Given the current geopolitical tensions, I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures. **Palantir ($PLTR)**: military data analysis and intelligence fusion. Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts, especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran ( a near-total nationwide internet blackout (around 99% disruption since January 8, confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts), as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using military-grade interference, with packet loss reaching up to 80% in some areas. Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities, an estimated 50,000 smuggled terminals remain in use). However, this time I’m clearly talking about investing rather than short-term trading, which is why I’m approaching it differently. Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this: * Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels? * Is this a structural shift, or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction? * How (if at all) are you integrating metals into a portfolio that’s otherwise equity-heavy? Not looking for predictions, just thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m not_usually a metals investor . I mostly stick to equities ETFs and some crypto . But given the current political and macro backdrop I ’ m starting to question whether ignoring gold and silver right now is actually the bigger risk . Gold and silver have been in a very strong uptrend over the past days and weeks . Gold is trading around $ 4675– $ 4690oz up roughly 1.8 % to 1.9 % today while silver is near $ 94oz up 5 % to 6.6 % today . Silver has been especially volatile up about 25 % YTD 2026 and roughly 200 % over the past year . From a macro perspective this looks like a classic safehaven rally driven by several overlapping factors Geopolitical tensions renewed tradewar risks US–Europe tariff threats and broader instability are pushing investors toward defensive assets . Macro uncertainty a weaker US dollar uncertainty around Fed leadership and rate cuts persistent inflation and rising global debt levels . Central bank behavior continued strong gold purchases especially from China as part of reserve diversification . Silverspecific dynamics rising industrial demand electrification AI infrastructure cryptorelated hardware structural supply deficits export restrictions and its classification as a critical mineral in the US . Some analysts Citi JPMorgan are talking about $ 5000 gold and $ 100 silver into 2026 though that obviously comes with downside risks . A pullback from profittaking seems very possible after such a sharp move even if the broader trend remains bullish . I ’ m personally conflicted . On one hand this feels late in the move . On the other if the political and macro situation deteriorates further not_having any exposure to precious metals could be a blind spot in my portfolio . I ’ m not_looking at physical metals but rather trading exposure which makes it easier to follow institutional flows and manage risk . That said I ’ m aware metals behave very differently from equities and crypto . Even crypto platforms Bitget for example now offer gold and silver trading through their TradFi products which I ’ ve already tested from a trading perspective . Execution is fast and fees are low . Given the current geopolitical tensions I have also identified a potential stock that could benefit from a surge despite the instability on Bitget Stock Futures . Palantir $ PLTR military data analysis and intelligence fusion . Demand typically increases during periods of heightened security alerts especially in light of the potential risk of a U.S. intervention in Greenland and the situation in Iran a neartotal nationwide internet blackout around 99 % disruption since January 8 confirmed by NetBlocks and cybersecurity experts as well as widespread jamming of Starlink satellite internet using militarygrade interference with packet loss reaching up to 80 % in some areas . Despite bans and active crackdowns by authorities an estimated 50000 smuggled terminals remain in use . However this time I ’ m clearly talking about investing rather than shortterm trading which is why I ’ m approaching it differently . Curious to hear how others here are thinking about this Are gold and silver still effective hedges at these levels Is this a structural shift or just a crowded trade waiting for a correction How if at all are you integrating metals into a portfolio that ’ s otherwise equityheavy Not_looking for predictions just thoughtful perspectives ."

      "selftext": "I’ve been seeing bullish thesis’s for ADBE everywhere. I get it. Adobe is a great company. But ADBE is not a great stock. Most claims I hear are “great earnings” “Growth on sale” “moat + shrinking forward PE” or similar. In his book “The Most Important Thing,” Howard Marks proposes the concept of second-level thinking, which is a more complex analysis compared to first level-thinking, which is a more superficial one. I think there’s a lot of first-level thinking on ADBE in the market right now. A lot of investor price anchoring. And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth, instead of real compounding growth. I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not from increasing cash flow from operations. In FY 21, ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO, and repurchased $4.67 Billion common stock. In FY 25, adobe had $10 Billion in CFO and $12 Billion in share buybacks. So in a 5 year period, the CFO grew at 8.45% cagr, while the share buybacks grew at 26.61%. But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025. If you do a CFO 4-year cagr that’s adjusted for cash received for services rendered, ADBE’s 4-year cash flow growth is 6.28% Why make this adjustment? Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities. (Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds) Now to round out my analysis, I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 2021-2025: about 6%. Net these cagr’s: 6.28-6 =0.28% Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28% CFO cagr for ADBE 2021-2025- basically adobe’s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5% roughly, so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks. Since the rate of buyback increase can’t mathematically continue, it’s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon. Overall, I’m not saying ADBE is deteriorating, but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price, are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been seeing bullish thesis ’ s for ADBE everywhere . I get it . Adobe is a great company . But ADBE is not_a great stock . Most claims I hear are “ great earnings ” “ Growth on sale ” “ moat shrinking forward PE ” or similar . In his book “ The Most Important Thing ” Howard Marks proposes the concept of secondlevel thinking which is a more complex analysis compared to first levelthinking which is a more superficial one . I think there ’ s a lot of firstlevel thinking on ADBE in the market right now . A lot of investor price anchoring . And a lot of fixation on accounting profit growth instead of real compounding growth . I say this because most of the earnings growth is supported by share buybacks and not_from increasing cash flow from operations . In FY 21 ADBE had 7.23 Billion in CFO and repurchased $ 4.67 Billion common stock . In FY 25 adobe had $ 10 Billion in CFO and $ 12 Billion in share buybacks . So in a 5 year period the CFO grew at 8.45 % cagr while the share buybacks grew at 26.61 % . But notice that current unearned revenue increased by 0.774 B in 2025 . If you do a CFO 4year cagr that ’ s adjusted for cash received for services rendered ADBE ’ s 4year cash flow growth is 6.28 % Why make this adjustment Because unearned revenue is extra cash today for future liabilities . Likely to be 2026 cash flow headwinds Now to round out my analysis I calculate the rough cagr of CPI inflation 20212025 about 6 % . Net these cagr ’ s 6.286 0.28 % Adjusted for services rendered and inflation 0.28 % CFO cagr for ADBE 20212025 basically adobe ’ s CFO is moving in lockstep with inflation Earnings growth had a CAGR of 13.5 % roughly so the PE multiple improvement seems to be exclusively from inflation and buybacks . Since the rate of buyback increase can ’ t mathematically continue it ’ s likely the metrics that justify a higher share price have negative convexity on the horizon . Overall I ’ m not_saying ADBE is deteriorating but I am saying most of the reasons people give to forecast a higher share price are based on deceivingly optimistic metrics ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys. Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity. My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them. Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time. I didn’t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan. They got out. Just found out last year they weren’t my account managers anymore after leaving. I’m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though. I don’t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed. Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally. I’ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it’s so shady and you can’t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone. Anyways, now I’m with Fidelity. I had asked before on r/personalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap. High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica. This is what shows on my account that I own: ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on r/personalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio. Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND. I honestly have no idea what to do or what most of this means. I did read about the ones I own now and they’re not good is what I’m gathering? Sorry to sound so inept on this topic. I genuinely don’t know what to do. I was going to call Fidelity and have them help me but I don’t even know what to say or ask. I also need to withdraw some of my money to pay off credit cards. Recently pregnant and going to stop working and we can’t take on the debt with one paycheck. If it helps I’m also 33 years old if this makes a difference for anything above. Thank you all. Edit: clarification",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys . Extremely new to stocks and Fidelity . My MIL set me up with Primerica when my great grandparents passed and put my inheritance into a Roth IRA through them . Her and her husband were doing Primerica at the time . I didn ’ t know anything but knew I needed a savings plan . They got out . Just found out last year they weren ’ t my account managers anymore after leaving . I ’ m pretty sure they still use Primerica services though . I don ’ t know anything about stocks as it is so when I found out I was obviously pissed . Made the decision to switch to Fidelity finally . I ’ ve been wanting to leave Primerica for quite some time because it ’ s so shady and you can ’ t control or see anything yourself really without going through someone . Anyways now I ’ m with Fidelity . I had asked before on rpersonalfinance what to do and I remember them telling me my money will be in stocks that are basically crap . High expense ratio funds owned by Primerica . This is what shows on my account that I own ACGIX VAFAX SMEAX AIIEX ASIAX When I asked for advice on rpersonalfinance they told me to sell what I was in and build a 3 fund portfolio . Like VTI VXUS BND or VT and BND . I honestly have no_idea what to do or what most of this means . I did read about the ones I own now and they ’ re not_good is what I ’ m gathering Sorry to sound so inept on this topic . I genuinely don ’ t know what to do . I was going to call Fidelity and have them help me but I don ’ t even know what to say or ask . I also need to withdraw some of my money to pay off credit cards . Recently pregnant and going to stop working and we can ’ t take on the debt with one paycheck . If it helps I ’ m also 33 years old if this makes a difference for anything above . Thank you all . Edit clarification"

      "selftext": "Whatever your view of his moves – and it is striking how ostensibly market-friendly capitalists can either overlook this extraordinary level of government intervention, or even enthusiastically welcome it – one thing is clear: Trump knows how to command global attention. Equally striking is how little markets seem to care. Despite the barrage of policy shocks, the S&P 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month, while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain. That strength reflects Australia’s exposure to booming commodity markets, where surging gold and silver prices, along with another jump in copper, have driven solid gains for resources stocks. Are investors unusually foresighted, or simply complacent? Macquarie strategist Viktor Shvets argues it’s largely the latter, noting that investors are notoriously poor at pricing political and geopolitical risk. [ [",

Equally striking is how little markets seem to care . Despite the barrage of policy shocks the SP 500 has risen 3.3 per cent over the past month while the ASX 200 has outperformed with a 3.7 per cent gain . That strength reflects Australia ’ s exposure to booming commodity markets where surging gold and silver prices along with another jump in copper have driven solid gains for resources stocks .

Allowing allocations to drift can improve returns but increases concentration risk, while frequent rebalancing may reduce momentum and create tax or transaction friction. I’m curious how others approach this balance in practice. Do you follow strict calendar-based rules, percentage thresholds, or allow significant drift before acting ? How do you weigh risk control against return drag during long bull cycles.?",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, As you probably know, Jerome Powell is expected to step down from the Fed at the end of May. Over the last few months, Trump has been pushing hard for interest rate cuts, but Powell has held off, mainly because the US job market is still fairly strong and inflation remains a bit too high. Once Powell leaves, Trump will be the one appointing his replacement, and it seems reasonable to assume that a Fed chair chosen by Trump might be more open to cutting rates. Rate cuts usually make borrowing cheaper for companies, which can boost hiring and speed up economic activity, in simple terms, that’s generally good for the S&P 500. On the flip side, they also tend to push inflation higher and often weaken the dollar against the euro. Given this, do you think it makes sense to switch from a euro-denominated S&P 500 index fund to a currency-hedged one? For anyone who hasn’t really felt the impact of dollar weakness, just look at the numbers: over the last year, the S&P 500 is up about 17% in USD, but only around 4% in EUR. I'm Portuguese and that's why don't want it in dollars.",

      "title": "Volume III: Greenland & The Inevitable - Why Uranium Rare Earths and Strategic Materials Are About to Break the Market",
      "selftext": "Alright, I am back with Volume III. If you listened to me in late December, you should now be up around 45% YTD holding long. Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold: —— **My portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, LEU)** is not a bet on higher spot prices. It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics, energy security, and capital rotation. The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be. The desire for Greenland is not reckless, it was inevitable. It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago…. We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials. When that happens equity repricing does not happen gradually. It happens all at once. Like a fucking Hurricane. **The Macro Thesis** I. Energy security has replaced cost efficiency. II. China’s dominance is now politically intolerable. III. Supply chains cannot be rebuilt on demand. IV. Demand is inelastic and accelerating. V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints. Greenland was the accelerant not the cause. The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth - just like Venezuela. **The West does not control the materials it needs to function**. That realization does not lead to negotiation. It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding. **Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa** None of this started in Greenland. Greenland is the flashpoint not the origin. The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy. Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice. Control the inputs not the brands. While the West shut down processing, delayed permits, financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades, China invested directly in mines, built roads, ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources. **Africa was the centerpiece.** Across the DRC, Zambia, Namibia, Guinea, Zimbabwe and beyond, China locked up cobalt, copper, lithium, rare earths manganese, and graphite, not through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch (because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago). Once those contracts were signed the game was over. The molecules were spoken for. China now controls the majority of rare earths. We’re fucked and now we’re panicking. **The West’s Mistake and Why It Cannot Be Fixed Quickly** 1). The West assumed supply would always be available. 2). That China would remain a neutral trade partner. 3). That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy. By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened. You cannot rebuild mines in two years. You cannot rebuild processing in three. You cannot recreate workforce expertise overnight. You cannot manufacture social license on demand. China did not win because it was smarter. It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future. **What we are watching now is not a transition. It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake.** Emergency funding long term contracts, ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization. Time no longer exists. **Why Greenland Changed Everything** Greenland forced the issue into the open. It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained, that supply chains are political, and that China already made its move. This is not a new arms race. It is the late innings of one that already began. When time disappears price stops mattering. **The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control (and how to make money from this)** This portfolio (UUUU, MP, CCJ, LYC, & LEU) is not a collection of commodity stocks. *It is a collection of chokepoint owners.* **Energy Fuels** controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides. Mining without processing is irrelevant. Processing is the bottleneck. As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not a trade. **Cameco** sits at the center of Western uranium supply. Utilities do not want exposure to geopolitics. They want certainty. Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades. This is not price leverage. It is contract leverage. **Centrus** controls enrichment. Mining is step one. Enrichment is the gate. SMRs require HALEU. HALEU barely exists. Russia dominates enrichment and that is no longer acceptable. Centrus is not leveraged to spot uranium. It is leveraged to national security timelines. **MP Materials** controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States. No mine means no supply. No supply means no EVs no defense systems no AI hardware. Processing will follow but mining is the choke. **Lynas** is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China. That single fact makes it irreplaceable. In a real supply crisis Lynas does not compete. It gets allocated. YTD, this portfolio is up 40%. Tomorrow (and for the rest of Q1 and beyond) we should expect another major rally. **Final Thoughts** This is not a meme stock play. This is structural. A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates. Join the ride!",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright I am back with Volume III . If you listened to me in late December you should now be up around 45 % YTD holding long . Here is my next piece as we continue to track global events and the rare earths bananza continues to take hold —— My portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a bet on higher spot prices . It is a bet on physical bottlenecks colliding with geopolitics energy security and capital rotation . The market is still underestimating how violent that collision will be . The desire for Greenland is not_reckless it was inevitable . It is the visible phase of a transition that was locked in years ago… . We are entering a period where governments and utilities will pay whatever they must to secure supply of rare earths and materials . When that happens equity repricing does not_happen gradually . It happens all at once . Like a fucking Hurricane . The Macro Thesis I . Energy security has replaced cost efficiency . II . China ’ s dominance is now politically intolerable . III . Supply chains can not be rebuilt on demand . IV . Demand is inelastic and accelerating . V. Capital is rotating away from over owned growth and toward physical chokepoints . Greenland was the accelerant not_the cause . The moment Greenland entered the geopolitical spotlight markets were reminded of a simple truth just like Venezuela . The West does not_control the materials it needs to function . That realization does not_lead to negotiation . It leads to stockpiling long term contracts and panic bidding . Why This Was Set in Stone Years Ago China Won Africa None of this started in Greenland . Greenland is the flashpoint not_the origin . The origin was a twenty year strategic campaign where China secured the physical foundation of the global economy while the West assumed markets and interdependence would enable the continuation of their growth and supremacy . Beginning in the early 2000s China made a deliberate choice . Control the inputs not_the brands . While the West shut down processing delayed permits financialized commodities and treated minerals as cyclical trades China invested directly in mines built roads ports and rail while using state backed capital for long term access to resources . Africa was the centerpiece . Across the DRC Zambia Namibia Guinea Zimbabwe and beyond China locked up cobalt copper lithium rare earths manganese and graphite not_through spot markets but through multi decade offtake agreements and state to state deals the West refused to touch because were politically correct pansies playing a game against realists who understood this mineral war years ago . Once those contracts were signed the game was over . The molecules were spoken for . China now controls the majority of rare earths . We ’ re fucked and now we ’ re panicking . The West ’ s Mistake and Why It Can not Be Fixed Quickly 1 . The West assumed supply would always be available . 2 . That China would remain a neutral trade partner . 3 . That ESG frameworks and markets could replace strategy . By the time policymakers woke up the supply chain had already hardened . You can not rebuild mines in two years . You can not rebuild processing in three . You can not recreate workforce expertise overnight . You can not manufacture social license on demand . China did not_win because it was smarter . It won because it was earlier and planned for the long term future . What we are watching now is not_a transition . It is a forced unwind of a twenty year mistake . Emergency funding long term contracts ensuring strategic stockpiles and national security exemptions are all symptoms of the same realization . Time no_longer exists . Why Greenland Changed Everything Greenland forced the issue into the open . It reminded markets and policymakers that strategic minerals are geographically constrained that supply chains are political and that China already made its move . This is not_a new arms race . It is the late innings of one that already began . When time disappears price stops mattering . The Companies and the Bottlenecks They Control and how to make money from this This portfolio UUUU MP CCJ LYC LEU is not_a collection of commodity stocks . It is a collection of chokepoint owners . Energy Fuels controls one of the only domestic pathways in the United States for converting uranium into usable nuclear fuel and separating rare earth oxides . Mining without processing is irrelevant . Processing is the bottleneck . As supply nationalism accelerates Energy Fuels becomes policy infrastructure not_a trade . Cameco sits at the center of Western uranium supply . Utilities do not_want exposure to geopolitics . They want certainty . Cameco controls scalable politically acceptable supply at the exact moment utilities are pulling contracts forward and locking volumes for decades . This is not_price leverage . It is contract leverage . Centrus controls enrichment . Mining is step one . Enrichment is the gate . SMRs require HALEU . HALEU barely exists . Russia dominates enrichment and that is no_longer acceptable . Centrus is not_leveraged to spot uranium . It is leveraged to national security timelines . MP Materials controls the only large scale rare earth mine in the United States . No_mine means no_supply . No_supply means no_EVs no_defense systems no_AI hardware . Processing will follow but mining is the choke . Lynas is the only meaningful rare earth processor outside China . That single fact makes it irreplaceable . In a real supply crisis Lynas does not_compete . It gets allocated . YTD this portfolio is up 40 % . Tomorrow and for the rest of Q1 and beyond we should expect another major rally . Final Thoughts This is not_a meme stock play . This is structural . A Face melting lift off based around our world changing and the minerals needed to ensure it operates . Join the ride"

Acquirer is similar to Constellation Software.| |Managed Portfolio|1.1M|I've been working with the person who manages it for 5 years, I trust them and I like their strategy.| |ETFs|1.3M|60% S&P (Voo), 25% outside US (VEA), 15% emerging markets (VWO)| |Bonds|400k|Liquid quickly sellable bonds - should act as a cash reserve.| |Properties|1M|In different locations| I’m currently staying with my company and will have a salary, so don’t plan to withdraw any money.

      "selftext": "I’m 28M and currently maxing out my Traditional 401k and fully utilizing my company's Mega Backdoor Roth (MBDR) (so $72,000 a year). I’m looking to optimize my asset location. Right now, I’m basically mirroring my allocation in both (mostly total market/S&P 500), but I’m considering if I should be more intentional about which assets sit in which tax bucket. The Question: For those with significant balances in both Traditional and Roth, how do you split your holdings? Roth priority: Do you put your highest-growth/highest-risk assets here (e.g., Small Cap Value, Emerging Markets) to maximize tax-free growth? Traditional priority: Do you keep the \"steadier\" stuff here (e.g., S&P 500, Bonds) to mitigate the future tax bill? Or do you just keep the same allocation across all accounts for simplicity? My current thoughts: I'm leaning toward putting my Small Cap tilt in the Roth side and keeping the core S&P 500 in Traditional. I have a 30+ year horizon, so I want to be aggressive, but I’m curious if I'm overthinking the \"tax drag\" vs. the simplicity of mirroring. What’s your strategy and why?",

      "title": "Black Swan | The Greenland Gambit: Why Novo Nordisk (NVO) is the Ultimate Geopolitical Pawn | Denmark's Crown Jewel on US Entity Black List",
      "selftext": "# Section 1: The Arctic Standoff and the \"Novo Nordisk Risk\" In the early weeks of 2026, the frozen landscape of the Arctic has transformed into the most volatile theater in global geopolitics. What began as the \"Greenland Crisis\" has rapidly escalated from a diplomatic curiosity into a full-blown transatlantic fracture. At the epicenter of this dispute is a renewed, aggressive demand from Washington for the United States to purchase Greenland. This is a proposition the Danish government has repeatedly, and perhaps fatefully, characterized as \"absurd.\" # The Greenland-Denmark Nexus To understand the stakes, one must look at the structural ties binding the North Atlantic. While Greenland is a self-governing, autonomous territory, it remains an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark. * Financial Dependency: Copenhagen provides a substantial annual subsidy, known as the block grant, which accounts for roughly half of Greenland’s public budget. * Strategic Leverage: For Denmark, Greenland is not merely territory; it is the bedrock of their status as an Arctic power and their primary source of strategic leverage within the NATO alliance. # The Novo Nordisk Risk However, the true vulnerability of Denmark lies not in its military outposts, but on its balance sheet. We are witnessing a possible \"black swan\" event for the Danish economy centered on a single corporate giant. Novo Nordisk, the pharmaceutical titan behind the blockbuster GLP-1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, has achieved such staggering scale that its market capitalization frequently exceeds Denmark's entire annual GDP. This economic concentration creates a unique geopolitical fragility: * The Pension Anchor: The link to the Danish citizenry is direct and visceral. Danish pension funds, most notably ATP (the nation's largest supplementary provider), are heavily overweight in Novo Nordisk stock. * Retirement Security: As the company’s valuation soared, it became the foundation of Danish retirement security. * The Doom Loop: If Novo Nordisk is targeted, a \"Pension Doom Loop\" begins: a hit to the stock is a direct hit to the future solvency of the Danish middle class. By threatening Novo Nordisk, Washington isn't just targeting a company; it is actively undermining the financial sovereignty of the Danish state to force a hand on the Greenland sale. # Section 2: The Entity List: From Trade Tool to Financial Tactical Nuke To grasp the gravity of a move against Novo Nordisk, one must understand the mechanisms of the Entity List, managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). # What is the Entity List? Unlike a standard tariff, which merely increases the cost of a product, the Entity List functions as a technological and commercial blockade. It prohibits U.S. companies from exporting, re-exporting, or transferring specific technologies, software, or components to the listed entity without a specialized license that is notoriously difficult to obtain. # The Huawei Precedent The strategic blueprint for this move was established in 2019 when the Trump administration placed Huawei on the list, citing 5G national security concerns. The impact was surgical: * Supply Chain Strangulation: Huawei was severed from vital U.S. semiconductors and the Google Android ecosystem. * Market Share Collapse: Within two years, their global smartphone business plummeted from the #1 spot to the \"others\" category. * Strategic Containment: It effectively forced global allies to make a binary choice between U.S. technology and Chinese hardware. Applying this logic to Novo Nordisk represents a radical expansion of the \"national security\" definition. If the U.S. declares that \"Danish intransigence in the Arctic poses a threat to U.S. polar security,\" the Entity List becomes the ultimate tool to hold the world’s second most valuable pharmaceutical pipeline hostage until a deal is struck. # Section 3: The $500 Billion Erasure: Why Novo Nordisk Faces an 80% Drawdown This is the \"Doom Scenario\" for NVO shareholders. This would not be a standard market correction; it would be the systematic destruction of equity value. # The 80% Drawdown Thesis In a normal market, a poor earnings report might cause a 10% dip. However, an Entity List designation is a terminal event for a foreign firm dependent on U.S. markets. An 80% collapse is justified by four catastrophic pillars: * Revenue Amputation: Approximately 55% of Novo’s revenue would vanish overnight as the U.S. border effectively slams shut to Ozempic and Wegovy shipments. * The \"Illegal Drug\" Designation: Once on the list, U.S. insurance giants like UnitedHealth and CVS would likely be legally barred from processing payments to a blacklisted entity. The world’s most sought-after medications would be treated as \"contraband\" in their most lucrative market. * Manufacturing Seizure: Novo’s massive production facilities in Clayton, North Carolina, would likely be placed under \"protective custody\" or shuttered by federal mandate. Years of multi-billion dollar CAPEX would be rendered worthless or effectively nationalized. * The Margin Call of a Nation: As the market cap craters, Danish pension funds would be forced into a \"fire sale\" of other assets to cover losses. This would trigger a systemic collapse of the Danish Krone. This isn't just a stock falling; it’s the evaporation of a nation’s balance sheet. The Valuation Reality: When you strip away the \"Growth\" narrative and the \"U.S. Market\" access, Novo Nordisk resets to a European mid-cap with a broken supply chain. The stock would likely regress to 2010 price levels. # Section 4: Supply Chain Choke Points Retaliation: The Silicon Guillotine Brussels will not witness the dismantling of its most valuable firm in silence. If the U.S. executes the \"Novo Option,\" the EU will respond by targeting the one thing the U.S. economy cannot survive without: Semiconductors. # Weaponizing ASML ASML (Netherlands) holds a total, unbreakable monopoly on the EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography machines required to manufacture advanced chips for Nvidia, Apple, and AMD. Without ASML’s cooperation, the \"AI Revolution\" becomes a collection of empty glass buildings. 1. The Service Strike: Bricking the Fabs: The EU’s opening move would be the \"Service Kill-Switch.\" They would mandate that ASML cease all software updates, remote maintenance, and spare part deliveries to \"Hostile Trade Zones.\" This specifically targets the crown jewels of the U.S. CHIPS Act: the new TSMC and Intel fabs in Arizona and Ohio. * The Reality: **These machines are so complex they require constant calibration by Dutch technicians. Without them, U.S. chip manufacturing precision drifts within weeks, yields collapse, and the machines become the world's most expensive paperweights.** 2. The Hard Hardware Ceiling: The \"AI Supercycle\" hits a physical wall. If Nvidia cannot guarantee the next generation of Blackwell or Rubin chips because the machines are \"bricked\" by a Dutch software lock, the supply of compute (the \"oil\" of the 21st century) simply stops flowing. # Section 5: The AI Bubble Collapse: A Trillion-Dollar Reset This is where the geopolitical conflict triggers a generational market wipeout. The U.S. equity market is currently a house of cards built on the assumption of infinite AI growth. The ASML blockade is the gust of wind that brings it all down. # The $5 Trillion Vaporization * The Nvidia Death Spiral: Nvidia’s $3+ trillion valuation is predicated on flawless future growth. When the ASML \"Service Strike\" makes it clear that the next two years of chip supply are physically impossible to build, the stock faces an 80% drawdown. * The Hyperscaler Contagion: Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta have spent hundreds of billions on AI data centers. If the chips to fill them never arrive, that capex becomes \"dead money.\" The \"Mag 7\" lose their growth premium, triggering a rotation out of tech that the rest of the S&P 500 cannot absorb. * The Dot-Com 2.0 Event: In 2000, the bubble took years to deflate. In 2026, with algorithmic trading and \"doom scrolling\" sentiment, $5 trillion in market cap could evaporate in a single week. # Section 6: The Big Tech \"Solidarity Tax\": Seizing Silicon Valley Profits to Save the Danish State With the Danish pension system facing a catastrophic solvency crisis and the \"Silicon Guillotine\" of the ASML blockade already in motion, Brussels is expected to move beyond regulatory friction into the realm of direct financial confiscation. To fund the bailout of the Danish people, the EU will likely pivot toward a radical new fiscal instrument: the Geopolitical Solidarity Tax. # The $50B+ Revenue Seizure Under the emergency framework of the Anti-Coercion Instrument (ACI), the European Commission would designate U.S. \"Mag 7\" giants (specifically Google and Meta) as participants in an \"unfriendly economic blockade.\" * The Escrow Mandate: Instead of traditional multi-year antitrust litigations, the EU would mandate that all advertising and service revenue generated within the Eurozone be paid directly into an EU Sovereign Recovery Fund. * Immediate Liquidity: This provides the EU with an immediate, multi-billion dollar liquidity pool. These funds would be diverted directly to the Danish Central Bank to stabilize the Krone and recapitalize the ATP pension fund, effectively using American corporate profits to social-engineer a fix for the Danish middle class. # The End of Capital Repatriation For investors, the implications are chilling. The era of \"globalized profits\" ends the moment Brussels treats U.S. tech firms as state-owned assets of a hostile power. * The Valuation Trap: If Alphabet and Meta can no longer repatriate billions in quarterly European earnings, their free cash flow models break. * The Precedent: This sets a new global standard: if you are a dominant firm in a foreign market, your balance sheet is a hostage to your home country’s foreign policy. # The \"Digital Iron Curtain\" This taxation strategy and EUVA blockade forces a final, brutal choice for Silicon Valley: comply with the EU’s confiscatory tax to maintain access to 450 million high-value consumers, or pull out of the continent entirely. Most analysts predict a forced compliance and EUVA blockade, leading to a permanent \"Geopolitical Risk Discount\" on U.S. tech stocks that could shave another 40-50% off their terminal value.",

At the epicenter of this dispute is a renewed aggressive demand from Washington for the United States to purchase Greenland . This is a proposition the Danish government has repeatedly and perhaps fatefully characterized as absurd . The GreenlandDenmark Nexus To understand the stakes one must look at the structural ties binding the North Atlantic . While Greenland is a selfgoverning autonomous territory it remains an integral part of the Kingdom of Denmark . Financial Dependency Copenhagen provides a substantial annual subsidy known as the block grant which accounts for roughly half of Greenland ’ s public budget . Strategic Leverage For Denmark Greenland is not_merely territory it is the bedrock of their status as an Arctic power and their primary source of strategic leverage within the NATO alliance . The Novo Nordisk Risk However the true vulnerability of Denmark lies not_in its military outposts but on its balance sheet . We are witnessing a possible black swan event for the Danish economy centered on a single corporate giant . Novo Nordisk the pharmaceutical titan behind the blockbuster GLP1 drugs Ozempic and Wegovy has achieved such staggering scale that its market capitalization frequently exceeds Denmarks entire annual GDP . This economic concentration creates a unique geopolitical fragility The Pension Anchor The link to the Danish citizenry is direct and visceral . Danish pension funds most notably ATP the nations largest supplementary provider are heavily overweight in Novo Nordisk stock . Retirement Security As the company ’ s valuation soared it became the foundation of Danish retirement security . The Doom Loop If Novo Nordisk is targeted a Pension Doom Loop begins a hit to the stock is a direct hit to the future solvency of the Danish middle class . By threatening Novo Nordisk Washington isnt just targeting a company it is actively undermining the financial sovereignty of the Danish state to force a hand on the Greenland sale . Section 2 The Entity List From Trade Tool to Financial Tactical Nuke To grasp the gravity of a move against Novo Nordisk one must understand the mechanisms of the Entity List managed by the U.S. Department of Commerce ’ s Bureau of Industry and Security BIS . What is the Entity List Unlike a standard tariff which merely increases the cost of a product the Entity List functions as a technological and commercial blockade . It prohibits U.S. companies from exporting reexporting or transferring specific technologies software or components to the listed entity without a specialized license that is notoriously difficult to obtain . The Huawei Precedent The strategic blueprint for this move was established in 2019 when the Trump administration placed Huawei on the list citing 5G national security concerns . The impact was surgical Supply Chain Strangulation Huawei was severed from vital U.S. semiconductors and the Google Android ecosystem . Market Share Collapse Within two years their global smartphone business plummeted from the 1 spot to the others category . Strategic Containment It effectively forced global allies to make a binary choice between U.S. technology and Chinese hardware . Applying this logic to Novo Nordisk represents a radical expansion of the national security definition . If the U.S. declares that Danish intransigence in the Arctic poses a threat to U.S. polar security the Entity List becomes the ultimate tool to hold the world ’ s second most valuable pharmaceutical pipeline hostage until a deal is struck . Section 3 The $ 500 Billion Erasure Why Novo Nordisk Faces an 80 % Drawdown This is the Doom Scenario for NVO shareholders . This would not_be a standard market correction it would be the systematic destruction of equity value . The 80 % Drawdown Thesis In a normal market a poor earnings report might cause a 10 % dip . However an Entity List designation is a terminal event for a foreign firm dependent on U.S. markets . An 80 % collapse is justified by four catastrophic pillars Revenue Amputation Approximately 55 % of Novo ’ s revenue would vanish overnight as the U.S. border effectively slams shut to Ozempic and Wegovy shipments . The Illegal Drug Designation Once on the list U.S. insurance giants like UnitedHealth and CVS would likely be legally barred from processing payments to a blacklisted entity . The world ’ s most soughtafter medications would be treated as contraband in their most lucrative market . Manufacturing Seizure Novo ’ s massive production facilities in Clayton North Carolina would likely be placed under protective custody or shuttered by federal mandate . Years of multibillion dollar CAPEX would be rendered worthless or effectively nationalized . The Margin Call of a Nation As the market cap craters Danish pension funds would be forced into a fire sale of other assets to cover losses . This would trigger a systemic collapse of the Danish Krone . This isnt just a stock falling it ’ s the evaporation of a nation ’ s balance sheet . The Valuation Reality When you strip away the Growth narrative and the U.S. Market access Novo Nordisk resets to a European midcap with a broken supply chain . The stock would likely regress to 2010 price levels . Section 4 Supply Chain Choke Points Retaliation The Silicon Guillotine Brussels will not_witness the dismantling of its most valuable firm in silence . If the U.S. executes the Novo Option the EU will respond by targeting the one thing the U.S. economy can not survive without Semiconductors . Weaponizing ASML ASML Netherlands holds a total unbreakable monopoly on the EUV Extreme Ultraviolet lithography machines required to manufacture advanced chips for Nvidia Apple and AMD . Without ASML ’ s cooperation the AI Revolution becomes a collection of empty glass buildings . 1 . The Service Strike Bricking the Fabs The EU ’ s opening move would be the Service KillSwitch . They would mandate that ASML cease all software updates remote maintenance and spare part deliveries to Hostile Trade Zones . This specifically targets the crown jewels of the U.S. CHIPS Act the new TSMC and Intel fabs in Arizona and Ohio . The Reality These machines are so complex they require constant calibration by Dutch technicians . Without them U.S. chip manufacturing precision drifts within weeks yields collapse and the machines become the worlds most expensive paperweights . 2 . The Hard Hardware Ceiling The AI Supercycle hits a physical wall . If Nvidia can not guarantee the next generation of Blackwell or Rubin chips because the machines are bricked by a Dutch software lock the supply of compute the oil of the 21st century simply stops flowing . Section 5 The AI Bubble Collapse A TrillionDollar Reset This is where the geopolitical conflict triggers a generational market wipeout . The U.S. equity market is currently a house of cards built on the assumption of infinite AI growth . The ASML blockade is the gust of wind that brings it all down . The $ 5 Trillion Vaporization The Nvidia Death Spiral Nvidia ’ s $ 3 trillion valuation is predicated on flawless future growth . When the ASML Service Strike makes it clear that the next two years of chip supply are physically impossible to build the stock faces an 80 % drawdown . The Hyperscaler Contagion Microsoft Alphabet and Meta have spent hundreds of billions on AI data centers . If the chips to fill them never_arrive that capex becomes dead money . The Mag 7 lose their growth premium triggering a rotation out of tech that the rest of the SP 500 can not absorb . The DotCom 2.0 Event In 2000 the bubble took years to deflate . In 2026 with algorithmic trading and doom scrolling sentiment $ 5 trillion in market cap could evaporate in a single week . Section 6 The Big Tech Solidarity Tax Seizing Silicon Valley Profits to Save the Danish State With the Danish pension system facing a catastrophic solvency crisis and the Silicon Guillotine of the ASML blockade already in motion Brussels is expected to move beyond regulatory friction into the realm of direct financial confiscation . To fund the bailout of the Danish people the EU will likely pivot toward a radical new fiscal instrument the Geopolitical Solidarity Tax . The $ 50B Revenue Seizure Under the emergency framework of the AntiCoercion Instrument ACI the European Commission would designate U.S. Mag 7 giants specifically Google and Meta as participants in an unfriendly economic blockade . The Escrow Mandate Instead of traditional multiyear antitrust litigations the EU would mandate that all advertising and service revenue generated within the Eurozone be paid directly into an EU Sovereign Recovery Fund . Immediate Liquidity This provides the EU with an immediate multibillion dollar liquidity pool . These funds would be diverted directly to the Danish Central Bank to stabilize the Krone and recapitalize the ATP pension fund effectively using American corporate profits to socialengineer a fix for the Danish middle class . The End of Capital Repatriation For investors the implications are chilling . The era of globalized profits ends the moment Brussels treats U.S. tech firms as stateowned assets of a hostile power . The Valuation Trap If Alphabet and Meta can no_longer repatriate billions in quarterly European earnings their free cash flow models break . The Precedent This sets a new global standard if you are a dominant firm in a foreign market your balance sheet is a hostage to your home country ’ s foreign policy . The Digital Iron Curtain This taxation strategy and EUVA blockade forces a final brutal choice for Silicon Valley comply with the EU ’ s confiscatory tax to maintain access to 450 million highvalue consumers or pull out of the continent entirely . Most analysts predict a forced compliance and EUVA blockade leading to a permanent Geopolitical Risk Discount on U.S. tech stocks that could shave another 4050 % off their terminal value ."

      "selftext": "I have been reading the book The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham which I am half way through. I have really enjoyed the 2024 commentary from Jason Zweig. I'm just wondering if people actually read this book and how well it still holds up today. The book talks a lot about bond, which I don't hear a lot about these days - Does anyone here actually invest in bonds? For context, I'm male 30 and new to stock investing. I only started seriously investing half a year ago and have had decent return, but I think it's just because it has been a bull market. Now according to The Intelligent Investor, this is when I should rebalance and put the money I gained from growing stocks back into bond to keep the stock/bond ratio, but I rarely hear anyone talks about bonds around me. But with so many people speculating that the stock market would stop doing well soon, would bonds be a good hedge or should I invest in Berkshire Hathaway or just keep cash? And if bonds, which to buy? Sorry for having too many questions, but which other resources should I consider reading or following on a regular basis? What about the books Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits and One Up On Wall Street?",

      "selftext": "Here is DD on an undervalued silver and gold mining stock, CDE: Couer Mining (CDE) is currently trading at 22.6, and is valued at 32.2. I have shares at 18.5 and have been playing calls. I am expecting a BIG gap up on Tuesday so hopefully you guys bought in last week, but it may not be too late! Here is why I like CDE: They have an upcoming potential merger with NGD, a Canadian mining company. Once this merger goes through, they will have 7 operations across North America. They will have the production capability of 900,000oz of gold and 20,000,000oz of silver. They have had substantial revenue growth over the past year and have posted 6 straight quarters of profit. They have had production expansion, like the Rochester expansion and the integration of Las Chispas. Therefore, they are still growing. They have a very strong balance sheet and are expected to generate hundreds of millions in cash next year. I think this is one of the few mining companies that have lots of room to grow going into Q1 and Q2 2026. Their debt is mostly long-term, and their cash on hand vs total debt is 266m cash vs 363.5m debt. The coupon is fixed. I could not find the all-in sustaining cost, but it cost them $248m to sell $554.6m worth of gold and silver. All their mines are considered to be in safe areas; they have 3 in the US, 2 in Mexico, and 1 explorational site in BC. After the merger, they will acquire more sites in Canada. So none of the mines will be politically impacted. They have no active offering; as a matter of fact, they have a $75 million share buyback program valid through May 31, 2026. Their free cash flow is positive, at $188M. One thing to note is that CDE tends to follow the same direction as silver does so only buy CDE if you are bullish on silver!",

I’m not asking if wars cause values to go up or down per se. It’s more about the status of ownership in general. Does it make a difference what broker the assets are held within? Is it generally a unique situation every time? Examples, all assuming the investor is a US citizen, in the US, with a US brokerage, and the US goes to war with the UK. I just picked those 2 countries since it’s easy to find example assets, not because it’s likely they’d go to war. 1. What would happen to shares of BP traded on NYSE, which is a multinational based in the UK? 2. What about shares of an international ETF like VXUS, traded on NASDAQ? (According to some reports, 8.51% of VXUS holdings are in the UK.) 3. Would bonds be any different? (E.g. VTABX, with 8.33% holdings in the UK.)",

It ’ s more about the status of ownership in general . Does it make a difference what broker the assets are held within Is it generally a unique situation every time Examples all assuming the investor is a US citizen in the US with a US brokerage and the US goes to war with the UK . I just picked those 2 countries since it ’ s easy to find example assets not_because it ’ s likely they ’ d go to war . 1 . What would happen to shares of BP traded on NYSE which is a multinational based in the UK 2 . What about shares of an international ETF like VXUS traded on NASDAQ According to some reports 8.51 % of VXUS holdings are in the UK . 3 . Would bonds be any different E.g . VTABX with 8.33 % holdings in the UK ."

      "selftext": "Everyone seems to know feel that valuations are high. J.P. Morgan recently released data showing that when the S&P 500 trades at forward P/E ratios around 22x (where we are now), subsequent 10-year returns have historically ranged between +2% and -2%. For example -> Japan in 1989 was unstoppable and from a period of 15 years (1974 to 1989), the Nikkei 225 had gone up over 10x from 3600 to over 36,000. Then had 30 years of a rollercoaster after 1990 before crossing 36,000 again in 2023. What nobody seems to talk about is what we're supposed to *do* about it. Going through it, the standard options have problems: * **Treasuries**: 4-5% nominal, maybe 1-2% real adjusted for inflation. And then you have to time your re-entry. * **Gold**: Crushed it from 2000-2010 (+15% CAGR) while the S&P was flat (and now). But from 1980-1999, gold returned -6.5% annualized while stocks did +13%. * **International**: \"Cheaper\" for a decade now, but anyone who diversified has underperformed unless they did it last year. Classically it seems like most people take the route of doing nothing. Historically includes a lot of people who waited 10-30 years. The S&P 500 has done something similar in the last 16 years. Going from a low of 677 on March 2009 to 6900+ today in Jan 2026. Also 10x growth within a similar time period. Obviously a lot of what everyone is scared about is the AI bubble. Meanwhile in Japan back in 1989 I looked it up on Reddit and [anecdotes from that time make it sound more insane]( P/E ratios back then were also 60 to 80 for companies. So basically 10 to 30 years of bad returns is not unprecedented. Still Japan at least had deflation / low inflation. I'm curious on how everyone is thinking about potentially hedging.",

I fear that the relation between the US and Europe will continue to deteriorate. And I am scared that this will affect both sides of the Atlantic negatively. What I fear the most is that my stocks will be confiscated at some point down this road of stupidity because I am a non-US citizen holding US stocks. Is this a possibility? If yes, is there a way to protect myself against it, or do I just sell my US stocks? I wish everyone good luck during these crazy times, may the future be one where our leaders can work together for the good of all instead of bullying each other.",

I fear that the relation between the US and Europe will continue to deteriorate . And I am scared that this will affect both sides of the Atlantic negatively . What I fear the most is that my stocks will be confiscated at some point down this road of stupidity because I am a nonUS citizen holding US stocks . Is this a possibility If yes is there a way to protect myself against it or do I just sell my US stocks I wish everyone good luck during these crazy times may the future be one where our leaders can work together for the good of all instead of bullying each other ."

      "selftext": "Looking at the actual revenue split of the biggest US companies, such as the Mag 7. You can argue that they aren't really American companies anymore. They are global utilities that just happen to pay taxes in California. \\- Meta: \\~64% revenue from outside US \\- Apple: \\~64% revenue from outside US \\- Google: \\~56% revenue from outside US The only reason the rest of the world let these companies dominate their economies for 20 years is because the US was seen as the \"stable, boring adult\" in the room. We had high trust. That trust is evaporating. When the US political system looks erratic, foreign governments stop seeing Microsoft or Google as neutral tools. They start seeing them as liability risks from a volatile superpower. The counter-argument is these products are sticky and hard to change. That's true, Corporate IT switching costs are brutal. This isn't going to be a cliff where revenue drops 20% overnight. But change happens on the margins. It's not about losing the current customer. it's about losing the next one. \\- It's the German government choosing a local provider for their next 10-year cloud contract instead of Microsoft. \\- It's France passing laws that force data to stay in-country, destroying margins. \\- It's the Global South adopting Chinese stacks because they don't want to be reliant on US policy whims. This won't be a crash. It will be a slow, painful drag on growth for the next decade. So why has the market been doing well? I think the market was betting heavily that this political chaos is just \"temporary noise\" once Trump is gone everything snaps back to 2015 normalcy, and not pricing in enough of the reverse (for which there is plenty of catalyst such as seemingly never ending political polarization). My argument isn't that we crash tomorrow. It's that we are permanently damaging the infrastructure of trust that allows US tech to print money globally. Trust is hard to build and easy to lose. The market is pricing in \"volatility\" (which passes). It isn't pricing in \"erosion\" (which is long-term).",

      "selftext": "Trump has said “Starting on February 1st, 2026, all of the above mentioned Countries (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, The United Kingdom, The Netherlands, and Finland), will be charged a 10% Tariff on any and all goods sent to the United States of America. On June 1st, 2026, the Tariff will be increased to 25%. This Tariff will be due and payable until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland. The United States has been trying to do this transaction for over 150 years.” The tarrifs should be bullish for gold and silver due to amplifying economic uncertainty and safe haven demand. Metals have already rose due to factors like U.S. China Trade Concerns and policy shifts. Escalating overseas friction could further boost metals as tariffs historically fuel inflation (by raising import costs) and erode confidence in fiat currencies, prompting investors to rotate into gold/silver as a hedge",

      "title": "The US \"Safety Premium\" is dying. You are paying for stability that isn't there anymore.",
      "selftext": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world. The S&P 500 is historically expensive (Shiller PE near 40x). The usual argument is that the US deserves a \"Trust Premium.\" We have the stable government, the reserve currency, and the predictable policy. You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because it's the safe haven. But that trust is evaporating. We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time. With Trump's erratic behavior and policy by tweet, the \"predictable\" part of the US thesis is gone. If the US acts like a volatile emerging market, it shouldn't trade at a safety premium. Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing? The real asymmetry is abroad. \\- China: You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings. \\- South America/Europe: Massive discounts. \\- US: You pay a huge premium for \"safety\" while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day. The valuation gap is closing, and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house. This is why I think looking for \"value\" in the US right now is a mistake. People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays. They aren't. US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline (which has been for the last year) as long as the current policies persists. EDIT: 1. Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than ex-US markets. Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%. Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors. 2. People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge. But looking long term, I think we're coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding: \\- Education is slipping. You can't have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We're relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage. \\- Basic research is drying up. The \"inventing\" part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&D now, but they focus on next quarter's profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry. We are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world . The SP 500 is historically expensive Shiller PE near 40x . The usual argument is that the US deserves a Trust Premium . We have the stable government the reserve currency and the predictable policy . You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because its the safe haven . But that trust is evaporating . We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time . With Trumps erratic behavior and policy by tweet the predictable part of the US thesis is gone . If the US acts like a volatile emerging market it shouldnt trade at a safety premium . Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing The real asymmetry is abroad . China You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings . South AmericaEurope Massive discounts . US You pay a huge premium for safety while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day . The valuation gap is closing and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house . This is why I think looking for value in the US right now is a mistake . People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays . They arent . US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline which has been for the last year as long as the current policies persists . EDIT 1 . Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than exUS markets . Case in point VXUS is up 30 % over the last year while VTI is up less than 15 % . Taking into account of USD value dropping US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors . 2 . People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge . But looking long term I think were coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn . The foundations that built that advantage are eroding Education is slipping . You cant have tech dominance without a skilled workforce and we are failing to produce it locally . US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide . Were relying entirely on importing talent which Trump is doing his best to discourage . Basic research is drying up . The inventing part used to be funded by the government Internet GPS early biotech . Federal RD spend has crashed . Corporations do RD now but they focus on next quarters profit not_the deep science that creates the next industry . We are great at harvesting the crop right now but we stopped planting the next field ."

      "title": "The Greenland Rug Pull: Nuking the Markets for a Glacier",
      "selftext": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase, how do you all think the markets will react? **1)** They will have to finance this thing somehow. Obviously, they can't just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum. Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction, likely by stuffing student loans, federal land rights, or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via \"Greenland bonds.\" **2)** Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring (not to mention the depth of the market). Selling, say, $1-2T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt, driving prices of existing, lower-rate bond portfolios down right off the bat. There goes the bond market. **3)** The higher rates would lead to crowding out, as large institutional investors decide that holding high-rate bonds with a (basically) guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns. Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios (this would offset the impact of #2, but not on a 1:1 basis). Equity markets would fall as a result. **4)** The fact that these new pseudo-government bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the 'risk-free,' i.e., discount rate of the overall economy. If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3. >**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds. **5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression. >**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation. **6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets. **Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment. >**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in. >**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.",

      "selftext_processed": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase how do you all think the markets will react 1 They will have to finance this thing somehow . Obviously they cant just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum . Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction likely by stuffing student loans federal land rights or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via Greenland bonds . 2 Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring not to mention the depth of the market . Selling say $ 12T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt driving prices of existing lowerrate bond portfolios down right off the bat . There goes the bond market . 3 The higher rates would lead to crowding out as large institutional investors decide that holding highrate bonds with a basically guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns . Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios this would offset the impact of 2 but not_on a 11 basis . Equity markets would fall as a result . 4 The fact that these new pseudogovernment bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the riskfree i.e . discount rate of the overall economy . If you were evaluating an equitys fundamental value this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before . This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down combined with 3 . 4.1 The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates but in any case this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it . This would just hypercharge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds . 5 Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to DenmarkGreenland its effectively injected the global economy with $ 12T of debt strongly raising the likelihood of inflation . Remember its also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors student loans land rights etc . which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes budget cuts or everyones favorite more debt i.e . more inflation higher debttoGDP ratio higher rates and more equity and likely bond market depression . 5.1 A small nuanced point but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle which if priced incorrectly would essentially create money also driving up money supply and possibly longterm inflation . 6 Higher rates greater inflation and depressed equitybond markets leaves one trade left for investors i.e . a debasement trade in hard assets like goldsilver . Of course goldsilver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollarsell off for cash wont get into emerging market dynamics here but you can guess but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets . Takeaway This is highly speculative and the future is anything but predictable . But the truth is that the US probably doesnt have the firepower to finance this thing and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies theres no_way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation which itself jacks up rates . I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like goldsilver should begin to climb . High rates risk Fed action and even if the Fed does bring rates down any subsequent QEinduced inflation stands to depress bondequity valuations in this type of environment . Note 1 I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland . If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner i.e . essentially immediately then perhaps there is no_excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap ratescovering cashflow holes . I do think though regardless the effect of issuing highrate bonds to pull cashflows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events . Plus and ROI from Greenland would take decades well after the inflation has sunk in . Note 2 There is the possibility that the political crisis this haswill cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy but their interlinkage is so strong I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic ."

I prefer IT’s because they are low maintenance, virtually guarantee passive income in both good times and bad times, can be traded as easily as individual stocks and often trade below NAV (at a discount). Is it better to cherry pick your own stocks in up to 30 companies? Are the IT fees so high it makes them a less cost effective investment? Are junk bonds paying 10% interest just better? Overall I prefer IT’s and building them up for passive income during both my working life and retirement.",

The thing is though: if the US would indeed invade Greenland, it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe. So I am looking into how I can de-risk my portfolio - happy to hear your opinions on that. Update: Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions, it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on. I have always been one of those \"ride it out\" people, never panicked, always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run (like for example being up 500% on Alphabet or 1200% on Apple). But I think that IF something happens this time, it will be different. Because it would be a US centered, self-inflicted desaster of the US economy. Yes, it would also hurt the rest of the economy world-wide, but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades.",

      "title": "6 Reasons I Believe SNDK Still has room to run",
      "selftext": "&#x200B; Market Cap : 60 Billion Shares Outstanding : 150million Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data. Reason 2: Google Search Trends: Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks. I can't post links but just search up \"Google Trends\", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube. No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders. Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps. Most updated price targets from investing firms: Mizuho: $410 when the stock was only at $300 Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350 RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380 Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management. These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion ASTS: 280 million shares Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared. Reason 6: Extended Momentum Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO. That is all, good luck Positions: Feb 27 500c",

The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them . Everything from Robots cars data centers all need memory chips to store data . Reason 2 Google Search Trends Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked while the share price is making all time highs DAILY . Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green . This NEVER_happens to pump and dumps . Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop . look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of . It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks . I cant post links but just search up Google Trends type in SNDK and put worldwide 90 days . Reason 3 YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube . No_hyped up videos from streamers youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000 % ... I get it its already up so much . So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock thats your cue to sell yesterday . For SNDK theres none of that so far . This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first before all the retail traders . Reason 4 Analyst Price Targets Youll never_see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps . Most updated price targets from investing firms Mizuho $ 410 when the stock was only at $ 300 Bernstein $ 580 when it was trading at $ 350 RBC Capital $ 400 when it was at $ 380 Mizuho $ 700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein $ 900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital $ 1 Trillion in Assets under Management .

      "selftext": "I’ve been investing in the stock market for 5 years only using my own cash only. My portfolio is currently at around $150k right now. I’ve been getting emails about them changing the margin rates to 5% or lower just depends how much margin you use. It sounds like a good deal just use margin to invest in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and low risk ETFs and you’ll outperform it in the long run. And a bunch of people are saying margin is risky and you shouldn’t use it. I plan on using like 20-25% of the available margin to invest in ETFs because I’ll have cash on the side just in case there’s a bear market and I know there’s a chance to get margin call. Am I missing something that I should be aware of why this is a bad deal?",

      "title": "History of US equities, t-bills, treasuries, gold, and international returns",
      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below. Note that for the sections above, the \"other\" asset classes are aligned to the same date (i.e. US stock returns for \"After Bretton Woods\" started on 1971-08-15), even though these are not shown in the table below. |Year^\\*|Party|President|S&P|US|Intl|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1926 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|10.19%|13.80%||||1.87%||\\-1.77%| |1927 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|22.85%|26.36%||||2.61%||\\-1.65%| |1928 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|50.86%|46.26%||||3.17%||\\-0.08%| |1929 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-4.14%|\\-10.52%||||3.83%||\\-0.59%| |1930 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-22.54%|\\-26.01%||||1.80%||\\-7.65%| |1931 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-45.92%|\\-46.70%||||1.10%||\\-10.20%| |1932 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-27.51%|\\-25.74%||||0.35%||\\-9.92%| |1933 ([US](|Dem|F.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods . Both timelines are represented here CAGRYearsSP 500USGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1968present57.8010.81 % 10.81 % 8.30 % 4.58 % 6.38 % 3.94 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 8.19 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic24.8015.32 % 15.52 % 8.44 % 3.68 % 3.07 % 3.97 % After Bretton Woods 1971present54.4311.16 % 11.17 % 8.72 % 4.50 % 6.49 % 3.86 % Republican30.438.00 % 7.98 % 9.11 % 5.19 % 9.23 % 3.79 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents 15.52 % vs. 7.39 % with similar levels of inflation 3.97 % D vs. 3.92 % R. Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link . Note that these reflective cumulative returns for each period . All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following 1926 19260630 to 19270304 due to start of data series 1936 19360304 to 19370120 due to change in Inauguration Day 20th Amendment 2025 20250120 to 20260116 current 1961 1968 1969 Returns for treasuries† gold‡ and international§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below .

I saw that Schwab rates specific sectors outlooks monthly. For example, for January 2026, Communication Services, Health Care, and Industrials are all rated to outperform vs the SP500. They also list a few rated to underperform. It would be easy enough to keep your \"SP500\" investment strategy account slightly overweight in those sectors by buying some sector specific ETFs in those sectors rated to outperform. Does anybody do this? If so, how much extra do you put in sectors you hope will outperform the SP500? This is the link to the Schwab webpage that presents their sector ratings.

      "selftext": "With openAI announcing they’re about to start shoving ads into chatgpt there’s gonna be some takes about it being the end of Googles ad business or metas ad revenue, so let’s just sense check that with some numbers. Chat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut, at last count has something like 900 million users (give or take) but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying. Ads will be served to the rest. Ad business take serious time to scale. Example, Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $20b in sales for them. Which isn’t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there’s potential there but again, it takes time. As for Meta, they’ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was in a single quarter not a year. If I had to guess in 5 years time I’d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there’s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it’s everyone’s consensus winner).",

Chat GPT is definitely a consumer juggernaut at last count has something like 900 million users give or take but only a small single digit percentage of those are paying . Ads will be served to the rest . Ad business take serious time to scale . Example Amazon started offering them around 2017 and by 2020 they only generated $ 20b in sales for them . Which isn ’ t small but it is the context of a trillion dollar company which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be . Amazons ad business is now $ 56b per year 2024 figures so there ’ s potential there but again it takes time . As for Meta they ’ ll probably be fine . They did $ 50b in ad revenue too . Only difference It was in a single quarter not_a year . If I had to guess in 5 years time I ’ d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m but there ’ s no_good way to figure out who that might be yet e.g . only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race now it ’ s everyone ’ s consensus winner ."

      "selftext": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments, among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question. Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $50K worth of shares from one mutual fund. Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA, she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares, but we learned that \"buy orders are not currently being accepted on this fund\" within Schwab. I'm thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual, transferred the cash to Schwab, and then re-purchased through Schwab. Option 1 (this seems to be the worst option). Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and re-allocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA? Though, if buy orders aren't being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund, I'm not sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option. Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab. Also, I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year, in addition to tax consequences. OR Option 2. There is a \"swap funds\" feature that I need to investigate and better understand, which seems to be the right way to go about this, or at least the better option. But again, if \"buy orders are not being accepted\" - I'm not sure that's possible under the \"swap.\" Granted, we'd be \"swapping\" which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together. I presume it would be best to \"swap.\" Though, I'm not sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments, for instance 50% into a different mutual fund and 50% into an equity/stock. All this said - I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional. Though, any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated.",

Im thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual transferred the cash to Schwab and then repurchased through Schwab . Option 1 this seems to be the worst option . Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and reallocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA Though if buy orders arent being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund Im not_sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option . Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab . Also I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year in addition to tax consequences . OR Option 2 . There is a swap funds feature that I need to investigate and better understand which seems to be the right way to go about this or at least the better option . But again if buy orders are not_being accepted Im not_sure thats possible under the swap . Granted wed be swapping which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together . I presume it would be best to swap . Though Im not_sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments for instance 50 % into a different mutual fund and 50 % into an equitystock . All this said I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional . Though any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated ."

This is the way I am thinking about it as a 59 year old and would like some feedback especially if I have some blind spots. \\- Taking profits without really taking profits. \\- Hedge against market downturn. \\- Low interest that I pay back to myself. \\- No double taxation as it is a roth. Post tax money in and tax free money out. Are there any down sides other than missing out on market gains which at the age of 59 is not a huge consideration. If I take out the money and there is a %10 correction then I am buying back in at a discount. Thoughts?",

Hedge against market downturn . Low interest that I pay back to myself . No_double taxation as it is a roth . Post tax money in and tax free money out . Are there any down sides other than missing out on market gains which at the age of 59 is not_a huge consideration . If I take out the money and there is a % 10 correction then I am buying back in at a discount . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’d love any advice on how you’ve resisted the urge to panic sell (or drastically rebalance) to risk-off positions? In my case, as a 36-year-old, I really regret changing the stock/bond mix in my 401(k) more than three times over the past year. About a year ago, I kept waiting for the market to fall apart because of tariffs and all the geopolitical uncertainty, so I shifted to a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds. But as I watched how resilient the market’s been, I kept moving back toward equities. In the process, I’ve probably missed out on \\~10% gains. I keep telling myself, “Don’t touch the 401(k),” but man… the temptation is almost always there. I’ve committed to 50% VOO, 50% Vanguard Target 2065 (because I want international exposure). One solution that’s actually helped: I removed my 401(k) from my Monarch Money account, so I don’t see it whipsawing up and down every time I check my budget and other accounts. **\\*edit** This blew up! I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses, and much deserved ribbing from a few of you. There's a ton of helpful insights here: \"This is a good learning lesson where you sold when things seemed scary and bought when things felt better, which lost you money.\" \"One thing that helps me is investing into an IRA alongside my 401k. I made the rule for myself that the 401k is set it and forget it. Any stock trading, market timing, rebalancing I do in the IRA. It scratches my investment itch. Regardless of what’s happening in the world or the markets I just leave the 401k alone.\" \"Sounds like you should flip it all to the 2065 and never look at it again.\" \"I'm allowed to reallocate every 6 months (Jan 1 and Jul 1).\"",

About a year ago I kept waiting for the market to fall apart because of tariffs and all the geopolitical uncertainty so I shifted to a 6040 split between stocks and bonds . But as I watched how resilient the market ’ s been I kept moving back toward equities . In the process I ’ ve probably missed out on 10 % gains . I keep telling myself “ Don ’ t touch the 401k ” but man… the temptation is almost always there . I ’ ve committed to 50 % VOO 50 % Vanguard Target 2065 because I want international exposure . One solution that ’ s actually helped I removed my 401k from my Monarch Money account so I don ’ t see it whipsawing up and down every time I check my budget and other accounts . edit This blew up I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses and much deserved ribbing from a few of you . Theres a ton of helpful insights here This is a good learning lesson where you sold when things seemed scary and bought when things felt better which lost you money . One thing that helps me is investing into an IRA alongside my 401k . I made the rule for myself that the 401k is set it and forget it . Any stock trading market timing rebalancing I do in the IRA . It scratches my investment itch . Regardless of what ’ s happening in the world or the markets I just leave the 401k alone . Sounds like you should flip it all to the 2065 and never_look at it again . Im allowed to reallocate every 6 months Jan 1 and Jul 1 ."

Nana isn’t rolling in her grave anymore; she’s popping bottles in Valhalla. The \"National Champion\" is back. Here is why we are ripping through $60: • **Uncle Sam is the Whale:** The US Gov literally bought an **$8.9 Billion equity stake**. It’s officially too big to fail. If you short this, you are fighting the printing press. • **Literal Infinite Demand:** KeyBanc just confirmed that **2026 server CPU capacity is 100% SOLD OUT**. Hyperscalers are desperate for chips, and Intel is jacking up prices because they can. • **The Apple Leak:** Trump slipped up and said \"Apple went in\" after the government deal. If Tim Apple starts printing M-chips in Ohio on the new 18A node, the bears are absolutely cooked. • **Yields are Good:** 18A yields are hitting 60-75%. The tech actually works. Lip-Bu Tan (new CEO) isn't playing games. Earnings are **Jan 22**. The rocket is fueling up. **TL;DR:** Grandma Guy was right, just early. Buy shares to respect your elders. 🚀🚀🚀",

Nana isn ’ t rolling in her grave anymore she ’ s popping bottles in Valhalla . The National Champion is back . Here is why we are ripping through $ 60 • Uncle Sam is the Whale The US Gov literally bought an $ 8.9 Billion equity stake . It ’ s officially too big to fail . If you short this you are fighting the printing press . • Literal Infinite Demand KeyBanc just confirmed that 2026 server CPU capacity is 100 % SOLD OUT . Hyperscalers are desperate for chips and Intel is jacking up prices because they can . • The Apple Leak Trump slipped up and said Apple went in after the government deal . If Tim Apple starts printing Mchips in Ohio on the new 18A node the bears are absolutely cooked . • Yields are Good 18A yields are hitting 6075 % . The tech actually works . LipBu Tan new CEO isnt playing games . Earnings are Jan 22 . The rocket is fueling up . TLDR Grandma Guy was right just early . Buy shares to respect your elders . 🚀🚀🚀"

Anyway, onto the DD... I'll keep this short, over the past few weeks, IRWD has seen two pieces of news that aren’t huge on their own, but together meaningfully improve the stock. Linzess sales blowout * \\-Q3 Linzess sales came in at **\\~$315–350M vs. \\~$250M expected** * \\-Ironwood receives **\\~33% of Linzess sales** * \\-That translates to **\\~$104M in revenue this quarter**, up from **\\~$85M last quarter** * \\-That’s roughly **+$20M per quarter**, or **\\~$80M annually**, above expectations * \\-This was a much larger jump than anticipated and strengthens profitability going forward Pediatric label expansion * \\-Linzess received FDA label expansion for pediatric patients * \\-This makes Linzess the first drug available for this pediatric indication * \\-Expands the addressable market with limited competition * \\-Should further support future sales growth In Summery * \\-Both updates are clearly bullish * \\-Revenue is already strong and now has an added tailwind * \\-There’s currently very little bearish news in the near term * \\-The next key catalyst will be the **upcoming quarterly report**, especially any updates on the pipeline * \\-There is mostly upswing with a potential of 2x-3x in the next 6 months. That's it, pretty simple and easy play that I can see. Not financial advice — do your own DD. Good luck! My positions: [",

So now I have this baby account and Im not_a bot and just want to put that out there first . Anyway onto the DD ... Ill keep this short over the past few weeks IRWD has seen two pieces of news that aren ’ t huge on their own but together meaningfully improve the stock . Linzess sales blowout Q3 Linzess sales came in at $ 315–350M vs. $ 250M expected Ironwood receives 33 % of Linzess sales That translates to $ 104M in revenue this quarter up from $ 85M last quarter That ’ s roughly $ 20M per quarter or $ 80M annually above expectations This was a much larger jump than anticipated and strengthens profitability going forward Pediatric label expansion Linzess received FDA label expansion for pediatric patients This makes Linzess the first drug available for this pediatric indication Expands the addressable market with limited competition Should further support future sales growth In Summery Both updates are clearly bullish Revenue is already strong and now has an added tailwind There ’ s currently very little bearish news in the near term The next key catalyst will be the upcoming quarterly report especially any updates on the pipeline There is mostly upswing with a potential of 2x3x in the next 6 months . Thats it pretty simple and easy play that I can see . Not_financial advice — do your own DD . Good luck My positions"

Inflation rates are high in my country, so my aim is to gain in terms of dollar and invest in big companies and the most promising companies for the future IMO. I have been researching a lot, and I’ve come up with a tree fund ETF portfolio. I wanted to share it with you guys and have your opinion: VOO - QQQM - NLR I know there are a lot of overlaps between VOO and QQQM. However, I believe in the future of the tech industry. Furthermore to keep the tech industry going I think we need other types of energy, which is why I thought of a nuclear energy fond. I don’t know how their weight will be in my portfolio yet. I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts about the future of the tech industry as well. I’m 24 years old by the way, and my aim is to keep these funds as long as I can whether they go up or down and buy them every month. Thank you so much!",

As the title says I thought my employer 401k was invested in the market, but turns out it just has been in a cash reserve, which still isn't bad since it still gets a dividend, my question though is that, if I rollover the 401k into one of my other accounts would that count towards the 7k? Or since its already in an ira account, it won't count towards the limit, silly question, but it's something I'm not sure about and would like clarity.",

      "selftext": "Not financial advice. Just sharing how I’m looking at United Microelectronics Corporation and why I think it’s more interesting than most people realize. Everyone talks about AI chips and cutting-edge nodes, but most chips in the world don’t need that. UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry, industrial equipment, power management chips, displays, IoT devices, and networking gear. These markets care more about stability, reliability, and cost than raw performance. Once a customer designs a chip on UMC’s process, they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand. Over 80% of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes, and that market is not disappearing anytime soon. With expansions in Singapore, UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million+ in 2026. This is about half of that of TSMC, but more than other leading global mature node foundries. UMC is not frozen in the past. The company offers 14nm FinFET technology, which gives customers approximately 50–60% better power efficiency versus 28nm, along with improved performance at a reasonable cost. This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don’t want to pay premium prices for leading-edge production. UMC does not need to beat TSMC. It just needs to be dependable and it is. Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade. This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk. UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs, and Intel benefits from UMC’s experience running a high-mix foundry business. If even 5–10% of UMC’s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing, that alone could justify a higher valuation. It’s not TSMC, but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero. A 20–30% re-rating over the next few years does not seem unreasonable if utilization improves, the Intel partnership delivers, and mature-node demand remains steady. UMC is not a moonshot, but it’s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running. This company is trading at a depressed valuation, with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supply-chain diversification. I also believe that this is going to be their year. Volume has been moving like there’s something about to be unearthed. It may not be exciting, but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing. UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time.",

      "selftext_processed": "Not_financial advice . Just sharing how I ’ m looking at United Microelectronics Corporation and why I think it ’ s more interesting than most people realize . Everyone talks about AI chips and cuttingedge nodes but most chips in the world don ’ t need that . UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry industrial equipment power management chips displays IoT devices and networking gear . These markets care more about stability reliability and cost than raw performance . Once a customer designs a chip on UMC ’ s process they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand . Over 80 % of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes and that market is not_disappearing anytime soon . With expansions in Singapore UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million in 2026 . This is about half of that of TSMC but more than other leading global mature node foundries . UMC is not_frozen in the past . The company offers 14nm FinFET technology which gives customers approximately 50–60 % better power efficiency versus 28nm along with improved performance at a reasonable cost . This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don ’ t want to pay premium prices for leadingedge production . UMC does not_need to beat TSMC . It just needs to be dependable and it is . Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade . This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk . UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs and Intel benefits from UMC ’ s experience running a highmix foundry business . If even 5–10 % of UMC ’ s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing that alone could justify a higher valuation . It ’ s not_TSMC but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero . A 20–30 % rerating over the next few years does not_seem unreasonable if utilization improves the Intel partnership delivers and maturenode demand remains steady . UMC is not_a moonshot but it ’ s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running . This company is trading at a depressed valuation with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supplychain diversification . I also believe that this is going to be their year . Volume has been moving like there ’ s something about to be unearthed . It may not_be exciting but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing . UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time ."

      "selftext": "Source: [ >The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs, adding to the Trump administration’s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S. >Under the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $250 billion investment in the U.S., the Commerce Department said. In exchange, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15%, from 20%, and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America. The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week. >The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China. The Trump administration is attempting to de-escalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S. >The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC, which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy. They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products. >TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion, including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan. >“We’re going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. >Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a long-planned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation. Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly, they say. >TSMC’s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan’s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory, to be seized by force if necessary. >China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently, but some analysts say it wouldn’t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC’s production of chips. That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan, they say. >Under the trade agreement, Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona. The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there. >TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs adding to the Trump administration ’ s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S . Under the agreement Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $ 250 billion investment in the U.S. the Commerce Department said . In exchange the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 % from 20 % and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America . The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week . The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China . The Trump administration is attempting to deescalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S . The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy . They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products . TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan . “ We ’ re going to bring it all over so we become selfsufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors ” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC . Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a longplanned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation . Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly they say . TSMC ’ s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan ’ s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion . China claims the selfruled island as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary . China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently but some analysts say it wouldn ’ t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC ’ s production of chips . That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan they say . Under the trade agreement Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona . The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there . TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $ 56 billion on capital expenditures this year highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips ."

No more chasing gains and emotional trades without clear understanding of why the trade makes sense. Expecting 2026 to be big for space, AI, and autonomous vehicles. Core holdings are RKLB, ASTS, NBIS, PL, LUNR, ONDS, SLS I recently broke $1M net worth again and plan to stay above it by derisking from option plays via taking out initial capital after 100% increases. It’s worked out well so far. Hopefully the market doesn’t tank soon. Also using the wheel strategy in my brokerage account to make additional investment funds. Aiming to hit $2M net worth sometime this year. Doing it before 30 years old would be fun (I know I’m lucky)",

      "title": "TSMC earnings target up to $56B in 2026 capex and ~30% revenue growth, boosting the AI outlook. Pre-market: TSM +5%, ASML +7%",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $56 billion in capital spending for 2026, a stronger-than-anticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom. >Asia’s most valuable company expects expenditures of $52 billion to $56 billion this year, up at least a quarter from 2025. It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30% in 2026, faster than the average analyst estimate. Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6% to a record in Europe, sending its market value beyond $500 billion. >The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that’s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators. It’s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending. TSMC — Nvidia’s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout, most notably in the US, to sate future demand. >“You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst’s question on a conference call. “We’re investing $52 billion to $56 billion in capex, right? If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.” >Click here for a liveblog on the results. >TSMC reported NT$505.7 billion ($16 billion) in net income for the December quarter, beating the average estimate. That’s off previously reported sales of $33.1 billion in the period, helping the company surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025. >Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot. That’s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su, who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again. >“TSMC’s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. >The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips, now surpassing $1 trillion in planned expenditures, has helped TSMC achieve more than 30% annual sales growth over the past two years. But it may also hamper some parts of the company’s business. >An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025, when manufacturers prioritized premium high-bandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips. That’s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices. Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year. >Hsinchu-based TSMC still relies on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc.’s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business. The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026: Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6%. >On Thursday, Wei said his company won’t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as high-end smartphones are still selling well. >TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan. It’s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $165 billion in the US. >It’s also building plants in Japan and Germany, propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home. Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “close the gap” in supply versus demand.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $ 56 billion in capital spending for 2026 a strongerthananticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom . Asia ’ s most valuable company expects expenditures of $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion this year up at least a quarter from 2025 . It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30 % in 2026 faster than the average analyst estimate . Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6 % to a record in Europe sending its market value beyond $ 500 billion . The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that ’ s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators . It ’ s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending . TSMC — Nvidia ’ s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout most notably in the US to sate future demand . “ You ’ re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not_I ’ m also very nervous about it ” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst ’ s question on a conference call . “ We ’ re investing $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion in capex right If we don ’ t do it carefully that ’ d be a big disaster for TSMC. ” Click here for a liveblog on the results . TSMC reported NT $ 505.7 billion $ 16 billion in net income for the December quarter beating the average estimate . That ’ s off previously reported sales of $ 33.1 billion in the period helping the company surpass $ 100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025 . Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot . That ’ s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again . “ TSMC ’ s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term ” said Gary Tan a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments . The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips now surpassing $ 1 trillion in planned expenditures has helped TSMC achieve more than 30 % annual sales growth over the past two years . But it may also hamper some parts of the company ’ s business . An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025 when manufacturers prioritized premium highbandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips . That ’ s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices . Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year . Hsinchubased TSMC still relies on Apple Inc. ’ s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc. ’ s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business . The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026 Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6 % . On Thursday Wei said his company won ’ t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as highend smartphones are still selling well . TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan . It ’ s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $ 165 billion in the US . It ’ s also building plants in Japan and Germany propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home . Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “ close the gap ” in supply versus demand ."
