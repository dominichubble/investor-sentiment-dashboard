      "selftext": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world. The S&P 500 is historically expensive (Shiller PE near 40x). The usual argument is that the US deserves a \"Trust Premium.\" We have the stable government, the reserve currency, and the predictable policy. You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because it's the safe haven. But that trust is evaporating. We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time. With Trump's erratic behavior and policy by tweet, the \"predictable\" part of the US thesis is gone. If the US acts like a volatile emerging market, it shouldn't trade at a safety premium. Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing? The real asymmetry is abroad. \\- China: You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings. \\- South America/Europe: Massive discounts. \\- US: You pay a huge premium for \"safety\" while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day. The valuation gap is closing, and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house. This is why I think looking for \"value\" in the US right now is a mistake. People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays. They aren't. US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline (which has been for the last year) as long as the current policies persists. EDIT: 1. Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than ex-US markets. Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%. Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors. 2. People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge. But looking long term, I think we're coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding: \\- Education is slipping. You can't have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We're relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage. \\- Basic research is drying up. The \"inventing\" part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&D now, but they focus on next quarter's profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry. We are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyone knows US stocks trade at higher valuations than the rest of the world . The SP 500 is historically expensive Shiller PE near 40x . The usual argument is that the US deserves a Trust Premium . We have the stable government the reserve currency and the predictable policy . You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because its the safe haven . But that trust is evaporating . We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time . With Trumps erratic behavior and policy by tweet the predictable part of the US thesis is gone . If the US acts like a volatile emerging market it shouldnt trade at a safety premium . Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing The real asymmetry is abroad . China You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings . South AmericaEurope Massive discounts . US You pay a huge premium for safety while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day . The valuation gap is closing and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house . This is why I think looking for value in the US right now is a mistake . People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays . They arent . US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline which has been for the last year as long as the current policies persists . EDIT 1 . Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than exUS markets . Case in point VXUS is up 30 % over the last year while VTI is up less than 15 % . Taking into account of USD value dropping US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors . 2 . People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge . But looking long term I think were coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn . The foundations that built that advantage are eroding Education is slipping . You cant have tech dominance without a skilled workforce and we are failing to produce it locally . US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide . Were relying entirely on importing talent which Trump is doing his best to discourage . Basic research is drying up . The inventing part used to be funded by the government Internet GPS early biotech . Federal RD spend has crashed . Corporations do RD now but they focus on next quarters profit not_the deep science that creates the next industry . We are great at harvesting the crop right now but we stopped planting the next field ."

      "selftext": "A while ago, I was watching a stock that everyone seemed excited about. Good news, strong price action, lots of confidence in the comments. It felt like one of those trades you are supposed to take. But something felt off. Not because I thought the company was bad. Not because I had a better stock to buy. It was because I could not clearly answer one simple question: what is the worst thing that could happen if this goes wrong? I realized I had only looked at the upside. How high it could go. How fast. What the “best case” looked like. I had not seriously thought about the downside. So I did nothing. A few weeks later, the stock dropped hard. Nothing dramatic happened. No big scandal. Just a shift in sentiment and liquidity. People rushed out the same way they rushed in. I did not make money. But I also did not lose any. That experience changed how I look at trades. Sometimes the best decision is not buying or selling. It is stepping back and asking if you are prepared for the bad outcome, not just hoping for the good one. Curious how others here think about trades they choose not to take. Do you track those decisions, or only the ones you enter?",

Not one has dropped them but the stocks down 70 percent. There might not be a good AI program for that ATM with real results and likely won’t have that until at least 2 years. Consider TTD could also be the first to implement and adopt that technology when it works and is proven. Likely they’d just buy that company out. The big note nobody is talking about is what happened in 2024? Elections and huge campaign spending from democrats and republicans who need the best marketing and will pay for it. 2026 is midterm guys, financials will never look better for TTD. They’re going to get more money than they even know what to do with. Back at the end of Jan 2024 TTD bottomed and went up doubled. Were half the price currently that we were even at the bottom in 2024 at 35$ I’m unbelievably bullish on Trade Desk",

Not_one has dropped them but the stocks down 70 percent . There might not_be a good AI program for that ATM with real results and likely won ’ t have that until at least 2 years . Consider TTD could also be the first to implement and adopt that technology when it works and is proven . Likely they ’ d just buy that company out . The big note nobody_is talking about is what happened in 2024 Elections and huge campaign spending from democrats and republicans who need the best marketing and will pay for it . 2026 is midterm guys financials will never_look better for TTD . They ’ re going to get more money than they even know what to do with . Back at the end of Jan 2024 TTD bottomed and went up doubled . Were half the price currently that we were even at the bottom in 2024 at 35 $ I ’ m unbelievably bullish on Trade Desk"

      "selftext": "Just thought I’d share this lesson I was taught in case it helps anyone (been investing 17 years, learned from some pretty smart people along the way). When it comes to news and investing it’s pretty tempting to think a) that big ‘news’ events will affect the market, and b) that you can buy / sell something to benefit and profit from that news. The truth though? It’s doesn’t happen anywhere near as much as we think it does. The way that I think about it is on one extreme you have: - ‘really big news that crashes the market’ and then on the other end you have, - ‘really big news that a lot of people THINK is gonna the market then nothing really happens.’ Now when you really think about it, which of these happens more? It’s definitely the second one. Just think, in the last few months all the chat we’ve had about debt ceiling stuff, Iran nuclear facilities bombings, the Ukraine war, Venezuela, Greenland, investigating the Fed chair, Iran protests, on again, off again tariffs with a dozen different places. And how all of those things were gonna be bad for the market or even crash it. Hasn’t really happened has it? The strategy of successful investors I learned from was to just tune out a lot of that stuff as ‘noise’ cause living in all that noise and trying to react to it all is actually super distracting and not great for your investing. And by investing I mean buying businesses that do their thing well and holding them while they grow their earnings and then their value (market cap, share price) grows with that. If you want to trade day to day news, there’s nothing wrong with that, but it’s basically a coin flip so the odds aren’t with you there.",

Hasn ’ t really happened has it The strategy of successful investors I learned from was to just tune out a lot of that stuff as ‘ noise ’ cause living in all that noise and trying to react to it all is actually super distracting and not_great for your investing . And by investing I mean buying businesses that do their thing well and holding them while they grow their earnings and then their value market cap share price grows with that . If you want to trade day to day news there ’ s nothing_wrong with that but it ’ s basically a coin flip so the odds aren ’ t with you there ."

It is implausible that these announcements aren’t planned in advanced, with those that have knowledge - directly or indirectly (more likely) - profiting off them. Unfortunately, there’s no one to hold them accountable either, as those who have the ability to are either complicit or too fearful.

      "title": "The Greenland Rug Pull: Nuking the Markets for a Glacier",
      "selftext": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase, how do you all think the markets will react? **1)** They will have to finance this thing somehow. Obviously, they can't just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum. Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction, likely by stuffing student loans, federal land rights, or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via \"Greenland bonds.\" **2)** Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring (not to mention the depth of the market). Selling, say, $1-2T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt, driving prices of existing, lower-rate bond portfolios down right off the bat. There goes the bond market. **3)** The higher rates would lead to crowding out, as large institutional investors decide that holding high-rate bonds with a (basically) guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns. Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios (this would offset the impact of #2, but not on a 1:1 basis). Equity markets would fall as a result. **4)** The fact that these new pseudo-government bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the 'risk-free,' i.e., discount rate of the overall economy. If you were evaluating an equity's fundamental value, this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before. This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down, combined with #3. >**4.1)** The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates, but in any case, this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it. This would just hyper-charge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds. **5)** Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to Denmark/Greenland, it's effectively injected the global economy with $1-2T of debt, strongly raising the likelihood of inflation. Remember it's also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors (student loans, land rights, etc.), which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes, budget cuts, or everyone's favorite, more debt - i.e., more inflation, higher debt-to-GDP ratio, higher rates, and more equity (and likely bond market) depression. >**5.1)** A small, nuanced point, but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle, which, if priced incorrectly would essentially 'create money,' also driving up money supply and possibly long-term inflation. **6)** Higher rates, greater inflation, and depressed equity/bond markets leaves one trade left for investors, i.e. a debasement trade in hard assets like gold/silver. Of course, gold/silver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollar/sell off for cash (won't get into emerging market dynamics here, but you can guess), but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets. **Takeaway)** This is highly speculative, and the future is anything but predictable. But the truth is that the US probably doesn't have the firepower to finance this thing, and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies there's no way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation (which itself jacks up rates). I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell, likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in, at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like gold/silver should begin to climb. High rates risk Fed action, and even if the Fed does bring rates down, any subsequent QE-induced inflation stands to depress bond/equity valuations in this type of environment. >**Note 1)** I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland. If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner, i.e., essentially immediately, then perhaps there is no excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap rates/covering cash-flow holes. I do think, though, regardless, the effect of issuing high-rate bonds to pull cash-flows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events. Plus, and ROI from Greenland would take decades, well after the inflation has sunk in. >**Note 2)** There is the possibility that the political crisis this has/will cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US, which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy - but their interlinkage is so strong, I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic.",

      "selftext_processed": "If the administration actually gets to a place where Greenland is up for purchase how do you all think the markets will react 1 They will have to finance this thing somehow . Obviously they cant just issue pure US debt given the political liability around the debt quantum . Bessent has signaled they could go the path of using a Sovereign Wealth Fund to finance the transaction likely by stuffing student loans federal land rights or other assets and securitizing them out to investors via Greenland bonds . 2 Those bonds will have to trade higher than standard US debt given the risk premium and novelty of the structuring not to mention the depth of the market . Selling say $ 12T of these new instruments would flood the market with higher rate debt driving prices of existing lowerrate bond portfolios down right off the bat . There goes the bond market . 3 The higher rates would lead to crowding out as large institutional investors decide that holding highrate bonds with a basically guaranteed return is worth more than holding equities with less certain returns . Institutional investors would sell off equities to buy larger bond portfolios this would offset the impact of 2 but not_on a 11 basis . Equity markets would fall as a result . 4 The fact that these new pseudogovernment bonds would be issued at a higher rate effectively increases the riskfree i.e . discount rate of the overall economy . If you were evaluating an equitys fundamental value this increased discount rate would result in the equity being worth less than before . This is a second factor that would push the equity markets down combined with 3 . 4.1 The Fed could step in here and perform QE to cap rates but in any case this is akin to the US printing money to fund the purchase of Greenland as opposed to financing it . This would just hypercharge the next point as the Fed creates new money to buy the excess bonds . 5 Once the funds are raised and the government actually sends out the cash to DenmarkGreenland its effectively injected the global economy with $ 12T of debt strongly raising the likelihood of inflation . Remember its also pledged what were previously government cash flows to investors student loans land rights etc . which will create a cash flow hole for the US government that will need to be filled with either taxes budget cuts or everyones favorite more debt i.e . more inflation higher debttoGDP ratio higher rates and more equity and likely bond market depression . 5.1 A small nuanced point but the way the US will likely need to structure these bonds to make them marketable to investors will require them to retain an equity tranche in the securitization vehicle which if priced incorrectly would essentially create money also driving up money supply and possibly longterm inflation . 6 Higher rates greater inflation and depressed equitybond markets leaves one trade left for investors i.e . a debasement trade in hard assets like goldsilver . Of course goldsilver might crash at first as investors flock to the dollarsell off for cash wont get into emerging market dynamics here but you can guess but eventually the inflationary effects will get priced in and drive demand for the assets . Takeaway This is highly speculative and the future is anything but predictable . But the truth is that the US probably doesnt have the firepower to finance this thing and the fact that any ROI on Greenland would take years to manifest implies theres no_way out of buying the island without jacking up rates and inflation which itself jacks up rates . I think the winning strategy here is all about timing a buy and sell likely staying out of the capital markets until it becomes apparent that inflation is being priced in at which point bond markets will have corrected and hard assets like goldsilver should begin to climb . High rates risk Fed action and even if the Fed does bring rates down any subsequent QEinduced inflation stands to depress bondequity valuations in this type of environment . Note 1 I do think a lot of this hinges on the ROI of buying Greenland . If it turns out that the Island can pay for the debt and generate excess returns in a timely manner i.e . essentially immediately then perhaps there is no_excess inflation from the US printing debt to cap ratescovering cashflow holes . I do think though regardless the effect of issuing highrate bonds to pull cashflows forward and injecting the global economy with that capital has the capacity to trigger this general flow of events . Plus and ROI from Greenland would take decades well after the inflation has sunk in . Note 2 There is the possibility that the political crisis this haswill cause a deterioration in trade between the EU and the US which might limit the effects of a capital injection into the EU on the US economy but their interlinkage is so strong I doubt there can ever be a true wall keeping inflation east of the Atlantic ."

      "title": "Trump announces he will sue JPMorgan ‘over the next two weeks’ for allegedly ‘DEBANKING’ him",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection. Trump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives. JPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons. During the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years. Earlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack. The president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post. “Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.” Trump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion. Dimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.” Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers. \"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “ the next two weeks ” for allegedly “ DEBANKING ” him after the Jan. 6 2021 Capitol insurrection . Trump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships . He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration . Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “ debanking ” conservatives . JPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons . During the 2024 campaign JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president but their relationship has since soured . Trump in August went after Dimon ’ s bank as well as Bank of America accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years . Earlier in 2025 the Trump Organization sued Capital One accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business which was founded by the president ’ s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics following the Capitol attack . The president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon . “ A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states without any verification that I offered Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase the job of Fed Chairman . This statement is totally untrue there was never_such an offer ” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post . “ Why wouldn ’ t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not_such an offer was made I would have very quickly told them ‘ NO ’ and that would have been the end of the story ” Trump added in the post . “ Why would I give it to Jamie No_such offer was made there or even thought of either . The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘ fact checking ’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE. ” Trump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year . Dimon took that as a joke according to the Journal citing people briefed on the discussion . Dimon asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he ’ d take the role said Absolutely positively no_chance no_way no_how for any reason. ” Trump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department ’ s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell for whom the bank CEO said he has “ enormous respect ” could threaten central bank independence . Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump ’ s proposal to cap creditcard interest rates with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers . It would be very bad for consumers very bad for the economy JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank ’ s earnings call last Tuesday ."

I have put myself on track for retirement with my IRA, 401k, real estate and high yield savings. I have dabbled a bit in my own little brokerage account and done well with some heavy hitting stocks like Nvidia and Google. Companies that have a strong history and are not super risky. But I want to grow my brokerage account!! How do you guys learn what companies to invest in and when to buy and sell? Do you read investing newsletters, pay for a service or do you do your own research by reading the news and intepreting? What are you paying attention to in the news?",

      "selftext": "Alright, so I (based in Europe) have a solid 6 figure amount in individual stocks and ETFs - almost exclusively US tech companies and NASDAQ etc though. And I have been doing well with that. The thing is though: if the US would indeed invade Greenland, it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe. So I am looking into how I can de-risk my portfolio - happy to hear your opinions on that. Update: Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions, it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on. I have always been one of those \"ride it out\" people, never panicked, always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run (like for example being up 500% on Alphabet or 1200% on Apple). But I think that IF something happens this time, it will be different. Because it would be a US centered, self-inflicted desaster of the US economy. Yes, it would also hurt the rest of the economy world-wide, but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades.",

And I have been doing well with that . The thing is though if the US would indeed invade Greenland it will definitely have devastating consequences on the American economy and Europe would essentially ban American companies from operating in Europe . So I am looking into how I can derisk my portfolio happy to hear your opinions on that . Update Thank you everyone who made reasonable suggestions it gave me lots of valuable info and there are a few things I will take action on . I have always been one of those ride it out people never_panicked always held my stuff and it always paid out in the long run like for example being up 500 % on Alphabet or 1200 % on Apple . But I think that IF something happens this time it will be different . Because it would be a US centered selfinflicted desaster of the US economy . Yes it would also hurt the rest of the economy worldwide but the trust in the US as reliable partner would be gone for decades ."

      "selftext": "&#x200B; Market Cap : 60 Billion Shares Outstanding : 150million Reason 1: Ai Data center and robotics We have a stock which is directly tied to the current market trend of AI Data centers. The current trend is that there is crazy shortages in Memory chips, and Sandisk is one of the companies that creates them. Everything from Robots, cars, data centers all need memory chips to store data. Reason 2: Google Search Trends: Google trends for SNDK worldwide for the last 90 days havent peaked, while the share price is making all time highs DAILY. Even during red market days this shit is barely red or even green. This NEVER happens to pump and dumps. Shitty pump and dumps crash the moment searches on Google drop. look at the graph yourself and compare it to any other pump and dumps you know of. It is also still less popular than the most popular stocks. I can't post links but just search up \"Google Trends\", type in SNDK and put worldwide, 90 days. Reason 3: YouTube streamers and Financial Influencers Search for SNDK on youtube. No hyped up videos from streamers, youtube influencers yet the stock is up 1000%... I get it, its already up so much. So then where are all the reddit ai bots and videos trying to hype it up? Whenever you see those bots trying to pump up the stock, thats your cue to sell yesterday. For SNDK, there's none of that so far. This makes me believe that it was all institutions quietly buying it at first, before all the retail traders. Reason 4: Analyst Price Targets You'll never see analyst price targets for shitty pump and dumps. Most updated price targets from investing firms: Mizuho: $410 when the stock was only at $300 Bernstein: $580 when it was trading at $350 RBC Capital: $400 when it was at $380 Mizuho: $700Billion in Assets under management Bernstein: $900Billion in Assets under management BC Capital: $1 Trillion in Assets under Management. These are serious predictions, not some guys in a mom's basement Reason 5: It is TINY compared to other companies 150m shares outstanding means it can move FAST compared to many other companies in the sector Micron (MU) 1.1Billion shares. Market Cap: 380Billion ASTS: 280 million shares Nvidia (NVDA) 24 Billion Shares, Market Cap: 4.5T SNDK? 150million and 60Billion Market cap. Absolutely tiny compared. Reason 6: Extended Momentum Just look at the graph, this has been pumping forever. Not 1 or 2 days, Or weeks, or months. its been pumping since IPO. That is all, good luck Positions: Feb 27 500c",

Dealer hedging, LEAPs getting rolled/unwound, gamma nonsense, etc. Basically price getting pushed around for reasons that have nothing to do with the actual business. I’ve seen other high-beta names get sold into big expirations and then randomly rip once the hedging pressure disappears. Not saying it has to happen here, just wondering if that’s in play. Full disclosure so you can roast me properly: I’m holding 615 calls expiring 1/30. Bought them Thursday, averaged down yesterday. Yes, I hate myself a little.

I’ve been getting emails about them changing the margin rates to 5% or lower just depends how much margin you use. It sounds like a good deal just use margin to invest in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq and low risk ETFs and you’ll outperform it in the long run. And a bunch of people are saying margin is risky and you shouldn’t use it. I plan on using like 20-25% of the available margin to invest in ETFs because I’ll have cash on the side just in case there’s a bear market and I know there’s a chance to get margin call. Am I missing something that I should be aware of why this is a bad deal?",

I ’ ve been getting emails about them changing the margin rates to 5 % or lower just depends how much margin you use . It sounds like a good deal just use margin to invest in the SP 500 and Nasdaq and low risk ETFs and you ’ ll outperform it in the long run . And a bunch of people are saying margin is risky and you shouldn ’ t use it . I plan on using like 2025 % of the available margin to invest in ETFs because I ’ ll have cash on the side just in case there ’ s a bear market and I know there ’ s a chance to get margin call . Am I missing something that I should be aware of why this is a bad deal"

Everyone seems extremely bullish with everyone sharing their YTD returns in high beta stocks. This transition from november/december to 2026 doesnt made sense to me.. So i wanted to ask, if a rug pull can eventually happen while everyone turns bullish all of a sudden? Does this ever happen in the markets, a market maker eventually creating fomo with all these high beta names to creatr bagholders. I know it is impossible to call the top, just want to hear your opinions. The transition as i said from december to 2026 felt super weird to me. Thanks.",

      "selftext": "\"Discord JUST filed for IPO - they're betting on a $15B+ valuation 🤯 Here’s what we know so far: → 200M+ monthly active users → Valued at $15B in its last funding round (2021) → $600M+ in annual revenue (estimated) → $500M raised in their last funding round Discord started as a gaming chat app in 2015. Today, they host communities for everything: beatboxing, investing, AI, crypto, you name it. Back in 2021, Discord rejected a $12B offer from Microsoft. Now, they’re going public, aiming for even higher valuation. Here's what makes Discord different: They’ve built a $600M+ business mostly without ads - something nearly unheard of at this scale. While Meta, X, and TikTok are 90%+ ad-driven, Discord's core model is: \\- Nitro subscriptions ($9.99/mo) \\- Server boosts \\- Game distribution fees They only introduced \"Quests\" (sponsored challenges) in 2024, years after hitting massive scale. Most platforms start with ads but Discord added them as a bonus, not a crutch. The timing makes sense too. After a 3-year IPO freeze, the market is finally warming up. Tech IPOs raised $15.6B last year - double the year before - and Discord is riding that momentum! If they go public anywhere near their $15B valuation, it’s a major validation of a subscription-first monetization model for social platforms. It shows you don’t have to run ads to build a billion-dollar consumer business.\" ( i found this post) What do you think is a good evaluation to buy it when it launches? We know Discord has no competition in gaming and , if we bet that they will go against Teams for businesses, they can get a high market for business meeting apps.",

      "selftext": "After spending some time drafting this as a comment to a wsb post, i thought Id share my opinion more publicly to you guys. I would like to show and share my appreciation for firefly here, the currently hated and priced for failure rocketlab alternative. if you look at reaaons for past failures, all are easily fixable. They have had successes, indicating their tech works when done right. People shit on them because of idiot Astra ceo comment about their engines, fact is their reaver engines and first stage has 5/6 full success rate (not counting flight 7 test failure) , failing only on flight 1 due to a loose wire. Astra is a failed company that couldnt even get a rocket 1/10 the size of alpha into orbit and the failed ceo is just trying to shift blame. The fact that Northtrop is literally betting their future of their Antares on firefly supports this, as well as their 50 mil invesment in May 2025. Regarding the founder Tom, while probably not on Peter Beck absolute genius level, has a deeply technical background, ivy league phd, with experience from working at most major adrospace companies in deeply technical roles and rising through the engineering ranks. Recent management changes point to improvements in the human element. Transitioning to block 2 for mass manufacturing + moving to in house parts indicates moving in the right direction. Their lunar lander is only matched by intuitve machines, literally a duopoly in the medium term. Scitec + elytra = huge diversification and revenue potential MLV vehicle almost same timing as rklb neutron, probably by end 2026 or early 2027. Market has priced them for failure but if they can show success this year, it will massively rerate to rklb style valuation. Theres speculation they will merge with redwire once their alpha is more proven and stock price is up. Fly and redwire share the same majority owner. This would literally create a new space giant with full vertical integration that everyone else has to buy from. I fully agree RKLB is the better company, but after the 20x runup, it is fully valued. Fly as the runner up priced for failure has 10x potential if execution is right. I have gotten downvotes here for supporting firefly from people who \"have worked there and wouldnt touch it with a pole\" or they point to failed astra ceo comments, but no negative comments can actually back up their negative sentiment with facts. I believe fly is massively undervalued. It was a damn steal at 20, still is at these price levels. The explosion in september gave a huge buying opportunity and the buying window at these levels will forever close IF flight 7 goes well. If not, just another buying oportunity.",

      "title": "History of US equities, t-bills, treasuries, gold, and international returns",
      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods . Both timelines are represented here CAGRYearsSP 500USGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1968present57.8010.81 % 10.81 % 8.30 % 4.58 % 6.38 % 3.94 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 8.19 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic24.8015.32 % 15.52 % 8.44 % 3.68 % 3.07 % 3.97 % After Bretton Woods 1971present54.4311.16 % 11.17 % 8.72 % 4.50 % 6.49 % 3.86 % Republican30.438.00 % 7.98 % 9.11 % 5.19 % 9.23 % 3.79 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents 15.52 % vs. 7.39 % with similar levels of inflation 3.97 % D vs. 3.92 % R. Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link .

All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following 1926 19260630 to 19270304 due to start of data series 1936 19360304 to 19370120 due to change in Inauguration Day 20th Amendment 2025 20250120 to 20260116 current 1961 1968 1969 Returns for treasuries† gold‡ and international§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below .

      "selftext": "In a recent thread on r/ETFs, I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international (and other asset classes) from Testfolio. In brief, US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, both on a nominal and an excess (above risk-free rate) basis, a phenomenon known as [\"the presidential puzzle\"]( However, correlation is not causation, and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of time-varying risk aversion. # Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests. Details for the data sources are [documented](#backtest): * SPYSIM: Mimics S&P 500. Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928, then Schwert S&P 500 composite portfolio through 1962, then S&P 500 price index through 1993, then SPY thereafter. * VTISIM: Total US stock market, based on Fama-French dataset from 1926-1992, then investible mutual funds/ETFs afterwards * VXUSSIM: International ex-US stock market, based on MSCI World ex-USA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996, then investible mutual funds afterwards. * VTSIM: Global. VTISIM/VXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008, then VT afterwards. * GLDSIM: Spot gold, based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004, then GLD afterwards. * TBILL: Fama-French Rf from 1926-1954, then 3-month T-bill rate thereafter. * IEFSIM: 10-year US treasury rate from 1962-2002, then IEF thereafter. * INFLATION: Unadjusted CPI-U. Additionally, to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent, I \"staggered\" the investment period by starting and ending it on \"Inauguration Day\" rather than \"New Year's Day\". Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937; prior to 1937, Inauguration Day was March 4, and this is reflected accordingly in the \"staggered years\". As such, 1973 refers to the period from 1973-01-20 to 1974-01-20. (Note also that this does not double-count January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio \"invests\" at the close of the starting day for each period.) A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post. # US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities, \"cash\" (risk-free treasuries), and inflation going back to 1926, with the Fama-French Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1926-present)|99.56|\\+10.28%|\\+10.23%|\\+3.33%|\\+2.95%| |Republican|47.68|\\+6.58%|\\+6.33%|\\+4.34%|\\+2.22%| |Democratic|51.88|\\+13.80%|\\+13.95%|\\+2.42%|\\+3.63%| |Post-Depression (1940-present)|86.00|\\+11.49%|\\+11.47%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.71%| |Republican|41.00|\\+9.07%|\\+8.96%|\\+4.69%|\\+3.43%| |Democratic|45.00|\\+13.74%|\\+13.81%|\\+2.77%|\\+3.97%| Going back to 1926, US equities (+10.28% p.a.) did better under Democratic presidencies (+13.80%) than under Republican ones (+6.58%). However, it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies (+3.63%) than under Republican ones (+2.22%), cash (or short-term treasury bills) paid less (+2.42%) under Democrats than under Republicans (+4.34%). We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depression--a terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership, but also a very deflationary one, with subsequent rebound under FDR--by starting our timeline in 1940. In this case, US equities still did better under Democrats (+13.74%) than Republicans (+9.07%), but the inflation gap (+3.97% vs. 3.43%) is closer; short-term treasury bills still paid less under Democrats (+2.77% vs. 4.69%). Regardless of which party was in office, you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal, real, and risk-free premium basis. That is, US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above risk-free treasury bills. # US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962, we have access to IEFSIM, which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002, and then on the IEF ETF (7-10 year treasuries) thereafter. This provides a real investment alternative to cash/t-bills. |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1962-present)|64.05|\\+10.52%|\\+10.58%|\\+4.52%|\\+6.01%|\\+3.77%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|31.05|\\+13.78%|\\+14.06%|\\+3.72%|\\+2.98%|\\+3.60%| During this time, US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents (+14.06% vs. +7.39%). Inflation was similar, slightly lower under Democrats (+3.60% vs. +3.92%). Treasuries paid higher under Republicans (+8.94% vs. +2.98%), which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis. In fact, US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents (+8.94% vs. +7.39%). # US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold, which has gained in popularity with its recent surge. This is a useful separate gauge because on balance short-term interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans, both on a nominal and real basis. However, gold provides a \"benchmark\" that is not directly affected by central bank policy. Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard, the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968; Testfolio has data starting on 1968-04-01. Additionally, the US did not formally break from the gold standard until Nixon's announcement on 1971-08-15 marked the end of Bretton Woods. Both timelines are represented here: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1968-present)|57.80|\\+10.81%|\\+10.81%|\\+8.30%|\\+4.58%|\\+6.38%|\\+3.94%| |Republican|33.00|\\+7.54%|\\+7.39%|\\+8.19%|\\+5.27%|\\+8.94%|\\+3.92%| |Democratic|24.80|\\+15.32%|\\+15.52%|\\+8.44%|\\+3.68%|\\+3.07%|\\+3.97%| |After Bretton Woods (1971-present)|54.43|\\+11.16%|\\+11.17%|\\+8.72%|\\+4.50%|\\+6.49%|\\+3.86%| |Republican|30.43|\\+8.00%|\\+7.98%|\\+9.11%|\\+5.19%|\\+9.23%|\\+3.79%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| This period was also characterized by better equity performance under Democratic presidents (+15.52% vs. +7.39%), with similar levels of inflation (+3.97% D vs. +3.92% R). Gold also performed similarly (+8.44% D vs. +8.19% R) regardless of political party in office. However, US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats (+15.52% vs. +8.44%), but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans (+7.39% vs. +8.19%). A similar (but more pronounced) trend can be seen if using the post-Bretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold. # US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international (ex-US) equities. This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy, because when the FOMC cuts, all else being equal, the dollar weakens relative to other currencies, thereby boosting USD-denominated international returns (and vice versa). Unfortunately, we do not have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices, which initially tracked only developed (MSCI World) markets: |CAGR|Years|S&P 500|US|International|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |Overall (1970-present)|56.05|\\+11.07%|\\+11.05%|\\+8.88%|\\+10.03%|\\+8.84%|\\+4.54%|\\+6.66%|\\+3.89%| |Republican|32.05|\\+8.01%|\\+7.94%|\\+8.17%|\\+8.05%|\\+9.31%|\\+5.22%|\\+9.39%|\\+3.85%| |Democratic|24.00|\\+15.31%|\\+15.35%|\\+9.84%|\\+12.74%|\\+8.23%|\\+3.64%|\\+3.11%|\\+3.94%| In 55 years of available data, US equities soundly outperformed international (+11.05% vs. +8.88%). However, outperformance came during Democratic presidencies (+15.35% vs. +9.84%); under Republican presidents, US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts (+7.94% vs. +8.17%). I want to emphasize these do not constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international (and certainly not to pull all your stocks out of the market). Past performance is not an indication of future performance. It is as nonsensical to say \"the US always underperforms under X\" as is to say \"the US will always outperform international\". # Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio. Because these are limited to five \"portfolios\" per backtest, for each year, I've put S&P 500, US, Cash, Treasuries, and Inflation in the \"US\" link and international, global, and gold in the \"gold\" or \"intl\" link. Note that these reflective \"cumulative\" returns for each period. All of these are one year periods with the exception of the following: * 1926: 1926-06-30 to 1927-03-04 due to start of data series * 1936: 1936-03-04 to 1937-01-20 due to change in Inauguration Day (20th Amendment) * 2025: 2025-01-20 to 2026-01-16 (current) * 1961, 1968, 1969: Returns for treasuries^†, gold^‡, and international^§ are based on start of data series as indicated in foot notes below. Note that for the sections above, the \"other\" asset classes are aligned to the same date (i.e. US stock returns for \"After Bretton Woods\" started on 1971-08-15), even though these are not shown in the table below. |Year^\\*|Party|President|S&P|US|Intl|Global|Gold|Cash|Treasuries|Inflation| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |1926 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|10.19%|13.80%||||1.87%||\\-1.77%| |1927 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|22.85%|26.36%||||2.61%||\\-1.65%| |1928 ([US](|Rep|Coolidge|50.86%|46.26%||||3.17%||\\-0.08%| |1929 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-4.14%|\\-10.52%||||3.83%||\\-0.59%| |1930 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-22.54%|\\-26.01%||||1.80%||\\-7.65%| |1931 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-45.92%|\\-46.70%||||1.10%||\\-10.20%| |1932 ([US](|Rep|Hoover|\\-27.51%|\\-25.74%||||0.35%||\\-9.92%| |1933 ([US](|Dem|F.

      "selftext_processed": "In a recent thread on rETFs I mentioned that I would provide data to break down the performance of US stocks vs. international and other asset classes from Testfolio . In brief US stock markets have performed better under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents both on a nominal and an excess above riskfree rate basis a phenomenon known as the presidential puzzle However correlation is not_causation and Pastor and Veronesi explain this through the context of timevarying risk aversion . Methodology Testfolio provides several tickers relevant for these backtests . Details for the data sources are documentedbacktest SPYSIM Mimics SP 500 . Based on Dow Jones Composite Portfolio through 1928 then Schwert SP 500 composite portfolio through 1962 then SP 500 price index through 1993 then SPY thereafter . VTISIM Total US stock market based on FamaFrench dataset from 19261992 then investible mutual fundsETFs afterwards VXUSSIM International exUS stock market based on MSCI World exUSA NR monthly data from 1970 to 1996 then investible mutual funds afterwards . VTSIM Global . VTISIMVXUSSIM at marketcap weights through 2008 then VT afterwards . GLDSIM Spot gold based on LBMA gold price from 1968 to 2004 then GLD afterwards . TBILL FamaFrench Rf from 19261954 then 3month Tbill rate thereafter . IEFSIM 10year US treasury rate from 19622002 then IEF thereafter . INFLATION Unadjusted CPIU . Additionally to better capture stock market returns attributable to each incumbent I staggered the investment period by starting and ending it on Inauguration Day rather than New Years Day . Note that Inauguration Day has been January 20 since 1937 prior to 1937 Inauguration Day was March 4 and this is reflected accordingly in the staggered years . As such 1973 refers to the period from 19730120 to 19740120 . Note also that this does not_doublecount January 20 for adjacent years because Testfolio invests at the close of the starting day for each period . A table with links to each of the data is on the bottom of this post . US Equities vs. Cash and Inflation We have data for US equities cash riskfree treasuries and inflation going back to 1926 with the FamaFrench Data Library doing much of the heavy lifting . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashInflation Overall 1926present99.5610.28 % 10.23 % 3.33 % 2.95 % Republican47.686.58 % 6.33 % 4.34 % 2.22 % Democratic51.8813.80 % 13.95 % 2.42 % 3.63 % PostDepression 1940present86.0011.49 % 11.47 % 3.68 % 3.71 % Republican41.009.07 % 8.96 % 4.69 % 3.43 % Democratic45.0013.74 % 13.81 % 2.77 % 3.97 % Going back to 1926 US equities 10.28 % p.a . did better under Democratic presidencies 13.80 % than under Republican ones 6.58 % . However it should be noted that even though inflation was also higher under Democratic presidencies 3.63 % than under Republican ones 2.22 % cash or shortterm treasury bills paid less 2.42 % under Democrats than under Republicans 4.34 % . We can strip out effects of the Roaring Twenties and the Great Depressiona terrible time for stock markets under Republican leadership but also a very deflationary one with subsequent rebound under FDRby starting our timeline in 1940 . In this case US equities still did better under Democrats 13.74 % than Republicans 9.07 % but the inflation gap 3.97 % vs. 3.43 % is closer shortterm treasury bills still paid less under Democrats 2.77 % vs. 4.69 % . Regardless of which party was in office you would have generally done well to stay invested in US equities on a nominal real and riskfree premium basis . That is US equities delivered positive returns that were above inflation and above riskfree treasury bills . US Equities vs. Treasuries Starting in 1962 we have access to IEFSIM which is based on US10Y treasury rates through 2002 and then on the IEF ETF 710 year treasuries thereafter . This provides a real investment alternative to cashtbills . CAGRYearsSP 500USCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1962present64.0510.52 % 10.58 % 4.52 % 6.01 % 3.77 % Republican33.007.54 % 7.39 % 5.27 % 8.94 % 3.92 % Democratic31.0513.78 % 14.06 % 3.72 % 2.98 % 3.60 % During this time US stock markets performed better under Democratic presidents 14.06 % vs. 7.39 % . Inflation was similar slightly lower under Democrats 3.60 % vs. 3.92 % . Treasuries paid higher under Republicans 8.94 % vs. 2.98 % which can be largely attributed to the Volcker era response to persistent inflation in the 1980s and the ZIRP policy of the 2010s in response to the Great Financial Crisis . In fact US treasuries have performed better than equities under Republican presidents 8.94 % vs. 7.39 % . US Equities vs. Gold Another alternative to US equities is gold which has gained in popularity with its recent surge . This is a useful separate gauge because on balance shortterm interest rates have been lower under Democratic presidents than under Republicans both on a nominal and real basis . However gold provides a benchmark that is not_directly affected by central bank policy . Because the dollar had been pegged to the gold standard the price was essentially fixed until the reopening of the LBMA in 1968 Testfolio has data starting on 19680401 . Additionally the US did not_formally break from the gold standard until Nixons announcement on 19710815 marked the end of Bretton Woods .

Gold also performed similarly 8.44 % D vs. 8.19 % R regardless of political party in office . However US equities significantly outperformed gold under Democrats 15.52 % vs. 8.44 % but performed essentially slightly worse under Republicans 7.39 % vs. 8.19 % . A similar but more pronounced trend can be seen if using the postBretton Woods period to look at US equities vs. gold . US Equities vs. International The final major asset class is international exUS equities . This also provides a separate gauge to isolate the effect of fiscal policy because when the FOMC cuts all else being equal the dollar weakens relative to other currencies thereby boosting USDdenominated international returns and vice versa . Unfortunately we do not_have any real data until 1970 for international markets with the creation of the MSCI indices which initially tracked only developed MSCI World markets CAGRYearsSP 500USInternationalGlobalGoldCashTreasuriesInflation Overall 1970present56.0511.07 % 11.05 % 8.88 % 10.03 % 8.84 % 4.54 % 6.66 % 3.89 % Republican32.058.01 % 7.94 % 8.17 % 8.05 % 9.31 % 5.22 % 9.39 % 3.85 % Democratic24.0015.31 % 15.35 % 9.84 % 12.74 % 8.23 % 3.64 % 3.11 % 3.94 % In 55 years of available data US equities soundly outperformed international 11.05 % vs. 8.88 % . However outperformance came during Democratic presidencies 15.35 % vs. 9.84 % under Republican presidents US equities slightly underperformed their international counterparts 7.94 % vs. 8.17 % . I want to emphasize these do not_constitute a reason to completely switch your asset allocation to gold or to international and certainly not_to pull all your stocks out of the market . Past performance is not_an indication of future performance . It is as nonsensical to say the US always underperforms under X as is to say the US will always outperform international . Testfolio Data Series All of these data are available through Testfolio . Because these are limited to five portfolios per backtest for each year Ive put SP 500 US Cash Treasuries and Inflation in the US link and international global and gold in the gold or intl link .

Rare earth is key to the future and China has been holding it hostage using it as leverage against U.S. and Japan. This sub is in serious need of some contrarian arguments just like it was in Q1 2025. [ The Greenland play is a U.S. And Japanese tech long term massive win. Bullish U.S. development mining companies for rare earth coming years. Already a strong industry that is expected to grow dramatically, opening up Greenland will cause a huge investment chance for the U.S. industry. Of course China rare earth will still be needed as global demand is projected to increase. Greenland under U.S. control will cause a flood in investing and growth, dont fall for the same bad take of 2025 Q1 that the markets will crash worst then 2008 ect... Listening to political hacks and bias hate posing as investing/market experts will cost you bigly. U.S. taking over Greenland is a rare earth bullish and tech bullish by removing the strangle hold China has over rare earth. Full Stop.",

Bullish U.S. development mining companies for rare earth coming years . Already a strong industry that is expected to grow dramatically opening up Greenland will cause a huge investment chance for the U.S. industry . Of course China rare earth will still be needed as global demand is projected to increase . Greenland under U.S. control will cause a flood in investing and growth dont fall for the same bad take of 2025 Q1 that the markets will crash worst then 2008 ect ... Listening to political hacks and bias hate posing as investingmarket experts will cost you bigly . U.S. taking over Greenland is a rare earth bullish and tech bullish by removing the strangle hold China has over rare earth . Full Stop ."

      "selftext": "2025 was a green year for most countries, with solid gains everywhere. But amid the bull run, returns varied wildly and **South Korea crushed it with +77.8%**. Just wow! But why? Breaking it down: * **Semiconductor mega-rebound (the big driver):** Korea's market is all about semis. Samsung (+155%) and SK Hynix (+275%) dominate the KOSPI. 2025 brought a huge DRAM/NAND cycle recovery, fueled by AI, data centers, GPUs, cloud, and edge computing. SK Hynix nailed it as Nvidia's key HBM supplier! * **South Korea underperformed US/Europe 2021-2024:** Set up for massive catch-up. Investors chased value, and Korea delivered big time. * **Rotation to ex-US markets:** Korea checks every box:tech, industrial, export-focused, liquid. Perfect for ditching overpriced US stocks. * **Weak won + export boost:** KRW stayed soft, supercharging export-heavy firms with higher margins, earnings beats, and stock re-ratings. * **Concentrated market amps up % gains:** Fewer mega-caps, but giants like these explode the overall cap. Quick shoutout to Spain's +64.5% killer run, thanks to: * Booming banks (IBEX heavyweight, low rates juicing lending) * \\~3% GDP surge (beating Euro peers on jobs/investment) * Tourism explosion (post-COVID come back) * Infrastructure boom (EU funds for housing/projects) * Credit upgrades (Moody's/Fitch/S&P drawing investors) * Edge in cheap energy/resilient exports You invested in Korean stocks last year. How about now? What stocks (Samsung, SK Hynix)?

      "selftext": "$SNAP is the ultimate contrarian pick. Everyone knows the cons: dilution, inept management thus far, poor ad stack, low ARPU, dick pick app, only teens use it, etc….thus the stock is priced accordingly. SNAP’s revenue has 10x’d since its IPO, yet its market cap has fallen by a third since then. Note that since the market cap figure is used (and not the stock price) this stat accounts for dilution! This is a fascinating statistic, almost mind-blowing. The main reason for this is simple: although SNAP has grown users and revenue by leaps and bounds, it has NEVER made a profit in its history. This is, yet again, an absurd statistic, especially for a company that has almost a billion users and has been around for well over a decade. It has not made a profit because management has simply never cared about profits. The founder and CEO became a billionaire in his 20’s after the IPO, and since his financial needs were taken care of, he decided to go on an empire building spree, which required a lot of capex and high compensation. Unfortunately, he didn’t succeed financially (although snap created a lot of innovative products, others such as meta just copied and monetized them, leaving snap in the dirt). Normally, in this situation, an activist would build up a position, get some board seats, fire the CEO, trim the fat and wasteful spending, and the stock would spike up. However, the founders have total control due to their voting rights, and thus SNAP has been left in the cold by investors. Here is why I think an inflection is coming, and why the stock could explode within the next 1-2 years: Management FINALLY recognizes the need to make money. They have said this several times recently, and in the Q3 call in November, they said they would be willing to monetize even at the expense of user growth and engagement. This is a sea change in attitude. SNAP has just wanted to grow in the past, without caring about profits. The fact that they are pivoting seems to be ignored by Wall St. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit they can pick. You see, when you have a billion users, even small things can create tremendous cashflow. Let’s take their recent announcement to monetize Memories storage. Even if 10% of users agree to pay a couple bucks a month, that could be billions in free cash flow with zero cost (they’re already providing unlimited storage for free). Same with their ad stack. Small improvements can make huge changes due to their massive scale. Without getting too granular, things like Sponsored Snaps have performed really well, and advertising in the inbox was previously an anathema to them. The important thing is that management has a changed attitude when it comes to profits. I could write another ten thousand words about this, but I think it’s long enough. I posted my position above (300k shares) and think we will hit $20 this year after Wall St sees several quarters in a row or increasing free cash flow and profitability. Oh yeah, if the Spectacles release goes well this year, the stock will fly. If it doesn’t, it won’t affect the stock at all since failure is already priced in. Think of Spectacles as a lottery that comes with zero cost. Disclosure: Long 300,000 shares at $7.6.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ SNAP is the ultimate contrarian pick . Everyone knows the cons dilution inept management thus far poor ad stack low ARPU dick pick app only teens use it etc….thus the stock is priced accordingly . SNAP ’ s revenue has 10x ’ d since its IPO yet its market cap has fallen by a third since then . Note that since the market cap figure is used and not_the stock price this stat accounts for dilution This is a fascinating statistic almost mindblowing . The main reason for this is simple although SNAP has grown users and revenue by leaps and bounds it has NEVER_made a profit in its history . This is yet again an absurd statistic especially for a company that has almost a billion users and has been around for well over a decade . It has not_made a profit because management has simply never_cared about profits . The founder and CEO became a billionaire in his 20 ’ s after the IPO and since his financial needs were taken care of he decided to go on an empire building spree which required a lot of capex and high compensation . Unfortunately he didn ’ t succeed financially although snap created a lot of innovative products others such as meta just copied and monetized them leaving snap in the dirt . Normally in this situation an activist would build up a position get some board seats fire the CEO trim the fat and wasteful spending and the stock would spike up . However the founders have total control due to their voting rights and thus SNAP has been left in the cold by investors . Here is why I think an inflection is coming and why the stock could explode within the next 12 years Management FINALLY recognizes the need to make money . They have said this several times recently and in the Q3 call in November they said they would be willing to monetize even at the expense of user growth and engagement . This is a sea change in attitude . SNAP has just wanted to grow in the past without caring about profits . The fact that they are pivoting seems to be ignored by Wall St . There is a lot of lowhanging fruit they can pick . You see when you have a billion users even small things can create tremendous cashflow . Let ’ s take their recent announcement to monetize Memories storage . Even if 10 % of users agree to pay a couple bucks a month that could be billions in free cash flow with zero cost they ’ re already providing unlimited storage for free . Same with their ad stack . Small improvements can make huge changes due to their massive scale . Without getting too granular things like Sponsored Snaps have performed really well and advertising in the inbox was previously an anathema to them . The important thing is that management has a changed attitude when it comes to profits . I could write another ten thousand words about this but I think it ’ s long enough . I posted my position above 300k shares and think we will hit $ 20 this year after Wall St sees several quarters in a row or increasing free cash flow and profitability . Oh yeah if the Spectacles release goes well this year the stock will fly . If it doesn ’ t it won ’ t affect the stock at all since failure is already priced in . Think of Spectacles as a lottery that comes with zero cost . Disclosure Long 300000 shares at $ 7.6 ."

I'm still learning the correlations with P/E ratios and EPS, does this mean the company is likely hugely overvalued? I'd really appreciate an explanation :) Their EPS is $0.42 USD as of their last earnings.

I havent seen a large company with a PE ratio over like 150 so I was surprised to see 510 . Im still learning the correlations with PE ratios and EPS does this mean the company is likely hugely overvalued Id really appreciate an explanation Their EPS is $ 0.42 USD as of their last earnings . Share Price $ 54.39 USD PE Ratio 510 Market Cap $ 14b USD Revenue $ 725m USD They have been performing well"

      "selftext": "Question and topic of conversation for S & P 500 Investors: Do you invest in a SP500 index fund, but then buy some sector ETFs to overweight any particular sectors? I saw that Schwab rates specific sectors outlooks monthly. For example, for January 2026, Communication Services, Health Care, and Industrials are all rated to outperform vs the SP500. They also list a few rated to underperform. It would be easy enough to keep your \"SP500\" investment strategy account slightly overweight in those sectors by buying some sector specific ETFs in those sectors rated to outperform. Does anybody do this? If so, how much extra do you put in sectors you hope will outperform the SP500? This is the link to the Schwab webpage that presents their sector ratings.

Which isn’t small, but it is the context of a trillion dollar company (which Amazon is and which OpenAI is trying to be). Amazons ad business is now $56b per year (2024 figures) so there’s potential there but again, it takes time. As for Meta, they’ll probably be fine. They did $50b in ad revenue too. Only difference? It was in a single quarter not a year. If I had to guess in 5 years time I’d say that one of the LLMs will take a chunk of ad revenue out of the market so that global ad spend will be split differently m, but there’s no good way to figure out who that might be yet (e.g. only 6 months ago Google was the main loser in the AI race, now it’s everyone’s consensus winner).",

The volatility on this thing is just insane, it gets hyped up one minute, then gets slammed the next just because some analyst calls the valuation 'unreasonable.' But retail doesn't seem to care; they’re still piling in like crazy. Plus, the latest update shows they’ve secured over $1B in contract commitments with strong interest from partners. It feels like a mix of a retail frenzy and a legitimate tech story. Honestly, do people think there’s still meat on the bone here, or is the bubble about to burst?",

      "title": "Question re: Roth IRA Transfer and Roth Swap",
      "selftext": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments, among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question. Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $50K worth of shares from one mutual fund. Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA, she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares, but we learned that \"buy orders are not currently being accepted on this fund\" within Schwab. I'm thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual, transferred the cash to Schwab, and then re-purchased through Schwab. Option 1 (this seems to be the worst option). Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and re-allocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA? Though, if buy orders aren't being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund, I'm not sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option. Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab. Also, I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year, in addition to tax consequences. OR Option 2. There is a \"swap funds\" feature that I need to investigate and better understand, which seems to be the right way to go about this, or at least the better option. But again, if \"buy orders are not being accepted\" - I'm not sure that's possible under the \"swap.\" Granted, we'd be \"swapping\" which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together. I presume it would be best to \"swap.\" Though, I'm not sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments, for instance 50% into a different mutual fund and 50% into an equity/stock. All this said - I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional. Though, any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "My wife recently transferred her Roth IRA from NW Mutual to a Schwab Roth IRA to avoid certain fees and give her more control over her investments among other reasons that are irrelevant to this question . Her transferred Roth IRA from NW Mutual consisted of about $ 50K worth of shares from one mutual fund . Upon completing the Roth IRA transfer from NW Mutual to the Schwab Roth IRA she tried to purchase some of those same mutual fund shares but we learned that buy orders are not_currently being accepted on this fund within Schwab . Im thinking she should have sold her shares through NW Mutual transferred the cash to Schwab and then repurchased through Schwab . Option 1 this seems to be the worst option . Can my wife sell all of these shares within Schwab and reallocate that cash to a separate but tradeable stock through her Schwab Roth IRA Though if buy orders arent being accepted through Schwab on this mutual fund Im not_sure selling these mutual fund shares through Schwab is even an option . Hence my above conclusion that she should have sold through NW Mutual before transferring the Roth IRA cash to Schwab . Also I believe triggering this Option 1 would create issues surrounding the amount she can contribute in a single year in addition to tax consequences . OR Option 2 . There is a swap funds feature that I need to investigate and better understand which seems to be the right way to go about this or at least the better option . But again if buy orders are not_being accepted Im not_sure thats possible under the swap . Granted wed be swapping which may be allowed and considered a different transaction all together . I presume it would be best to swap . Though Im not_sure she can swap portions of the mutual fund into multiple new investments for instance 50 % into a different mutual fund and 50 % into an equitystock . All this said I should probably just talk to a Schwab representative or a financial professional . Though any preliminary understanding I can gain here is most appreciated ."

I'm trying to understand if the latest news reflects a durable inflection point or might I have been better off lighting the cash on fire. What caught my attention was that the company is no longer just \"pipeline someday\" speculation. They have a marketed product (ANKTIVA) in bladder cancer, and there have been additional regulatory/clinical updates that are clearly driving interest. Does the current valuation/price action make sense if you model even a modest commercial ramp for the approved indication(s) or is this a primarily sentiment-driven share price jump getting ahead of itself? I'm looking at this through a few lenses 1. The revenue trajectory and what credible adoption looks like over the next 12-24 months 2. Cash runway and the probability/timing of additional financing 3. How much of the upside case depends on new indications vs the existing one 4. Whether management has a proven track record If anyone here has done deeper work on this stock or has any insight they would like to share, I am all ears. I'm not married to the position as this is just a small speculative holding for me, but I am comfortable sitting for 1-2 years if there is a real runway for this company to break out.",

Im trying to understand if the latest news reflects a durable inflection point or might I have been better off lighting the cash on fire . What caught my attention was that the company is no_longer just pipeline someday speculation . They have a marketed product ANKTIVA in bladder cancer and there have been additional regulatoryclinical updates that are clearly driving interest . Does the current valuationprice action make sense if you model even a modest commercial ramp for the approved indications or is this a primarily sentimentdriven share price jump getting ahead of itself Im looking at this through a few lenses 1 . The revenue trajectory and what credible adoption looks like over the next 1224 months 2 . Cash runway and the probabilitytiming of additional financing 3 . How much of the upside case depends on new indications vs the existing one 4 . Whether management has a proven track record If anyone here has done deeper work on this stock or has any insight they would like to share I am all ears . Im not_married to the position as this is just a small speculative holding for me but I am comfortable sitting for 12 years if there is a real runway for this company to break out ."

      "selftext": "OpenAI is rolling out testing of ads to free users and users on cheaper Go plan in the coming weeks. This is the big catalyst that needed to happen for GOOG earnings to finally take a hit, and what I was waiting for before I begin a short position in the stock. I had bought last April and was hoping to hold 1 year to avoid short term capital gains, but sold recently because I felt the risk is too high to continue holding. While users have shifted from Google to ChatGPT, it did not impact GOOG's earnings because advertisers(GOOGLE's actual customers) continued to spend on Google- higher revenue per impression/click/conversion, as well as bot traffic from agents made up for drops in real traffic. But Once OpenAI's ads program expands to all users(rather than just a test), tens of Billions of dollars that are spent on Google ads will be diverted to ChatGPT ads. Google has increasingly provided poor results for advertisers by providing misleading metrics, charging them for conversions that would've happened regardless of paid ads. For example, if you search for a product, often the company that sells the product is a sponsored result. Looking at their data, it looks like you can predict the cost per conversion, but in reality, you are paying for existing traffic. On top of this, because cost per conversion has been rising, advertisers are looking for alternatives that provide better ROI than Google search ads. On top of this, Google's display ads via its adsense network is also taking a hit, as partner websites experience less traffic due to AI overviews and general use of LLMs. ChatGPT ads offer a new way to pay for intent based traffic, and a way for businesses to diversify away from Google. This is likely the beginning of the end for Google. I believe GOOG faces the biggest threat because ChatGPT represents intent based advertising(Can display ads directly relevant to prompt/query), whereas other advertisers like Meta focus more on interest based advertising(displaying banner ads next to irrelevant content, that the user is expected to be interested in based on Machine learning)) Positions: 12/15/2028 $200 Put option",

They have billions of daily active users, across multiple integrated platforms and their ad revenue is unbelievable. As a business owner myself, IG and FB ads deliver more ROI anything else we’ve tried over the last decade. So can someone talk me out of dropping $50k on META when it’s at a such a discount? I’m failing to see how this isn’t a dip and with a potential split coming, it seems like a money printer?",

They have billions of daily active users across multiple integrated platforms and their ad revenue is unbelievable . As a business owner myself IG and FB ads deliver more ROI anything else we ’ ve tried over the last decade . So can someone talk me out of dropping $ 50k on META when it ’ s at a such a discount I ’ m failing to see how this isn ’ t a dip and with a potential split coming it seems like a money printer"

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’d love any advice on how you’ve resisted the urge to panic sell (or drastically rebalance) to risk-off positions? In my case, as a 36-year-old, I really regret changing the stock/bond mix in my 401(k) more than three times over the past year. About a year ago, I kept waiting for the market to fall apart because of tariffs and all the geopolitical uncertainty, so I shifted to a 60/40 split between stocks and bonds. But as I watched how resilient the market’s been, I kept moving back toward equities. In the process, I’ve probably missed out on \\~10% gains. I keep telling myself, “Don’t touch the 401(k),” but man… the temptation is almost always there. I’ve committed to 50% VOO, 50% Vanguard Target 2065 (because I want international exposure). One solution that’s actually helped: I removed my 401(k) from my Monarch Money account, so I don’t see it whipsawing up and down every time I check my budget and other accounts. **\\*edit** This blew up! I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses, and much deserved ribbing from a few of you. There's a ton of helpful insights here: \"This is a good learning lesson where you sold when things seemed scary and bought when things felt better, which lost you money.\" \"One thing that helps me is investing into an IRA alongside my 401k. I made the rule for myself that the 401k is set it and forget it. Any stock trading, market timing, rebalancing I do in the IRA. It scratches my investment itch. Regardless of what’s happening in the world or the markets I just leave the 401k alone.\" \"Sounds like you should flip it all to the 2065 and never look at it again.\" \"I'm allowed to reallocate every 6 months (Jan 1 and Jul 1).\"",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everyone I ’ d love any advice on how you ’ ve resisted the urge to panic sell or drastically rebalance to riskoff positions In my case as a 36yearold I really regret changing the stockbond mix in my 401k more than three times over the past year . About a year ago I kept waiting for the market to fall apart because of tariffs and all the geopolitical uncertainty so I shifted to a 6040 split between stocks and bonds . But as I watched how resilient the market ’ s been I kept moving back toward equities . In the process I ’ ve probably missed out on 10 % gains . I keep telling myself “ Don ’ t touch the 401k ” but man… the temptation is almost always there . I ’ ve committed to 50 % VOO 50 % Vanguard Target 2065 because I want international exposure . One solution that ’ s actually helped I removed my 401k from my Monarch Money account so I don ’ t see it whipsawing up and down every time I check my budget and other accounts . edit This blew up I really appreciate all of the thoughtful responses and much deserved ribbing from a few of you . Theres a ton of helpful insights here This is a good learning lesson where you sold when things seemed scary and bought when things felt better which lost you money . One thing that helps me is investing into an IRA alongside my 401k . I made the rule for myself that the 401k is set it and forget it . Any stock trading market timing rebalancing I do in the IRA . It scratches my investment itch . Regardless of what ’ s happening in the world or the markets I just leave the 401k alone . Sounds like you should flip it all to the 2065 and never_look at it again . Im allowed to reallocate every 6 months Jan 1 and Jul 1 ."

      "selftext": "> With U.S. ties at their lowest point in modern history, Canada is turning to one of the only countries with which it had even worse relations: China. Canada is forging a “new strategic partnership” with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “historic” trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump’s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence. For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning. “The United States used to be a friend and ally,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, “we are treated as an enemy.” > As part of an effort to “recalibrate” the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products. It’s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff. Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free. > Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years. “Further trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,” Ong said. About 75% of Canada’s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.",

      "selftext": "I used to post these benchmark updates here years ago. I still track the Vanguard lazy portfolio returns (Aggressive, Balanced, Conservative) as a basis for comparison. As a hobby project to teach myself some web dev, I rebuilt my old spreadsheet as a free calculator to automate it (SinceInception.com). I think everyone should pay attention to these and use them as their portfolio benchmarks, especially for those that pick their own stocks. 2025 was a strong year and 2026 is already off to a great start. |**Portfolio**|**2025 Total**|**2026 YTD**| |:-|:-|:-| |**Aggressive**|**23.1%**|**2.9%**| |**Balanced**|**16.2%**|**1.8%**| |**Conservative**|**11.7%**|**1.1%**| |**Risk Free**|**4.1%**|**0.1%**| I run an active portfolio myself, and seeing the gap in actual dollars has definitely changed how I view the time and effort I put into investing. I'll drop the link in the comments to avoid the spam filters if anyone wants to run their own numbers.",

If that diamond-handed maniac held his shares like he promised (he said he was holding for 10 years), his $700k \"disaster\" is now worth over **$1.1 Million**. Nana isn’t rolling in her grave anymore; she’s popping bottles in Valhalla. The \"National Champion\" is back. Here is why we are ripping through $60: • **Uncle Sam is the Whale:** The US Gov literally bought an **$8.9 Billion equity stake**. It’s officially too big to fail. If you short this, you are fighting the printing press. • **Literal Infinite Demand:** KeyBanc just confirmed that **2026 server CPU capacity is 100% SOLD OUT**. Hyperscalers are desperate for chips, and Intel is jacking up prices because they can. • **The Apple Leak:** Trump slipped up and said \"Apple went in\" after the government deal. If Tim Apple starts printing M-chips in Ohio on the new 18A node, the bears are absolutely cooked. • **Yields are Good:** 18A yields are hitting 60-75%. The tech actually works.

      "title": "Trump to Push Plan for Tech Companies to Fund New Power Plants",
      "selftext": "The Trump administration is planning to propose that the nation’s largest power grid operator hold an emergency auction in which tech companies would bid to have new power plants built, according to people familiar with the matter. The directive, expected Friday, would be an unprecedented attempt by the federal government to check rising electricity prices within PJM Interconnection, a 13-state power market spanning from New Jersey to Kentucky. The [build-out of data centers]( there in response to the artificial-intelligence boom is straining the grid’s capacity and has resulted in substantially higher costs in several of the grid operator’s recent power auctions. The emergency auction would allow tech companies to bid on 15-year contracts for new power plants in deals that would be worth billions of dollars, some of the people said. Bloomberg previously reported on the plans for the auction. PJM, home to the largest concentration of data centers in the U.S., has come under strain in recent years as tech companies seek to connect even more of them to the grid. Power plants there have been going out of service faster than they can be replaced, which has put a squeeze on power supplies as more electricity-hungry facilities come online. Read More [",

The directive expected Friday would be an unprecedented attempt by the federal government to check rising electricity prices within PJM Interconnection a 13state power market spanning from New Jersey to Kentucky . The buildout of data centers there in response to the artificialintelligence boom is straining the grid ’ s capacity and has resulted in substantially higher costs in several of the grid operator ’ s recent power auctions . The emergency auction would allow tech companies to bid on 15year contracts for new power plants in deals that would be worth billions of dollars some of the people said . Bloomberg previously reported on the plans for the auction . PJM home to the largest concentration of data centers in the U.S. has come under strain in recent years as tech companies seek to connect even more of them to the grid . Power plants there have been going out of service faster than they can be replaced which has put a squeeze on power supplies as more electricityhungry facilities come online . Read More"

Inflation rates are high in my country, so my aim is to gain in terms of dollar and invest in big companies and the most promising companies for the future IMO. I have been researching a lot, and I’ve come up with a tree fund ETF portfolio. I wanted to share it with you guys and have your opinion: VOO - QQQM - NLR I know there are a lot of overlaps between VOO and QQQM. However, I believe in the future of the tech industry. Furthermore to keep the tech industry going I think we need other types of energy, which is why I thought of a nuclear energy fond. I don’t know how their weight will be in my portfolio yet. I would appreciate it if you share your thoughts about the future of the tech industry as well. I’m 24 years old by the way, and my aim is to keep these funds as long as I can whether they go up or down and buy them every month. Thank you so much!",

Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

      "selftext": "Firstly, this is listed on the London Stock Exchange, its not ASC the shipping company, I'm talking about ASOS PLC. Current Market Cap: £340m Cash on Hand: £318m Revenue: £2.46bn Cash runway to 2030+ and flipping FCF positive. Which means they're trading at a Price to sales of 0.13, almost 3 times cheaper than popular bargain names like [JD.com]( What's more is the company is flipping back to profitability and if this continues their FCF could easily exceed their current Market Cap, which would force a complete repricing of its stock. Adjusted EBIDTA up 60% and Margins up 45-47% Insiders are clearly betting on that taking place with insider owned Camelot Capital purchasing shares almost every single trading session. William Barker owns Camelot Capital and also happens to be a board member and serves as deputy chair of ASOS. Now why would he and two other firms be so aggressive towards buying the entire float. * HEARTLAND A/S 28.3% ownership 33,775,687 shares * Mash Holdings Topco Limited (associated with Frasers Group PLC) 23.4%(around 27,900,414 shares). * Camelot Capital Partners LLC 15.4-15.5% 18,473,399 shares. (Owned by the chair of ASOS) Every time Ive seen this type of top heavy share accumulation it leads to a buyout; Just like Walgreens, EA, Skechers, Metro AG and TKO holding WWE, they all saw the exact same mass accumulation of shares right before and into a premium buyout offer. Their second top investor happens to be Fraser Group whom owns Sports Direct, Flannels, [Sofa.com]( and even Game stores. The other interesting option is a buyout from Asia, names like TEMU and others have attempted multiple times to get a listing on the UK stock exchange. A buyout of ASOS would give them access to European distribution, a well established brand AND listings on the London Stock Exchange. Now I could be way off the mark here but given they have cash runway until 2030+ and given it's literally one of the most underpriced $1bn+ revenue stocks listed (on any exchange) it feels worth a punt. Take a look into it and see what you think, I plan on buying some more calls and shares now.",

      "selftext": "U.S. stocks moved higher today as TSMC’s strong earnings and AI outlook helped lift market sentiment. The company reported a sharp jump in profits and announced higher capital spending plans for 2026, reinforcing the idea that AI infrastructure demand remains strong. The news sparked a rally across semiconductors and AI-linked names, helping the Nasdaq and S&P 500 recover recent losses. At the same time, bank stocks advanced on solid earnings, adding some breadth to the move beyond big tech. Renewed AI capex confidence and improving financial earnings, suggests markets are still willing to stay risk-on, at least for now. The key question is whether this turns into sustained momentum or remains a sector-specific rebound. Curious how others are positioning here: sticking with AI leaders, rotating into financials, or staying cautious into the next set of macro data?",

The company reported a sharp jump in profits and announced higher capital spending plans for 2026 reinforcing the idea that AI infrastructure demand remains strong . The news sparked a rally across semiconductors and AIlinked names helping the Nasdaq and SP 500 recover recent losses . At the same time bank stocks advanced on solid earnings adding some breadth to the move beyond big tech . Renewed AI capex confidence and improving financial earnings suggests markets are still willing to stay riskon at least for now . The key question is whether this turns into sustained momentum or remains a sectorspecific rebound . Curious how others are positioning here sticking with AI leaders rotating into financials or staying cautious into the next set of macro data"

As the title says I thought my employer 401k was invested in the market, but turns out it just has been in a cash reserve, which still isn't bad since it still gets a dividend, my question though is that, if I rollover the 401k into one of my other accounts would that count towards the 7k? Or since its already in an ira account, it won't count towards the limit, silly question, but it's something I'm not sure about and would like clarity.",

      "selftext": "Not financial advice. Just sharing how I’m looking at United Microelectronics Corporation and why I think it’s more interesting than most people realize. Everyone talks about AI chips and cutting-edge nodes, but most chips in the world don’t need that. UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry, industrial equipment, power management chips, displays, IoT devices, and networking gear. These markets care more about stability, reliability, and cost than raw performance. Once a customer designs a chip on UMC’s process, they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand. Over 80% of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes, and that market is not disappearing anytime soon. With expansions in Singapore, UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million+ in 2026. This is about half of that of TSMC, but more than other leading global mature node foundries. UMC is not frozen in the past. The company offers 14nm FinFET technology, which gives customers approximately 50–60% better power efficiency versus 28nm, along with improved performance at a reasonable cost. This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don’t want to pay premium prices for leading-edge production. UMC does not need to beat TSMC. It just needs to be dependable and it is. Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade. This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk. UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs, and Intel benefits from UMC’s experience running a high-mix foundry business. If even 5–10% of UMC’s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing, that alone could justify a higher valuation. It’s not TSMC, but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero. A 20–30% re-rating over the next few years does not seem unreasonable if utilization improves, the Intel partnership delivers, and mature-node demand remains steady. UMC is not a moonshot, but it’s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running. This company is trading at a depressed valuation, with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supply-chain diversification. I also believe that this is going to be their year. Volume has been moving like there’s something about to be unearthed. It may not be exciting, but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing. UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time.",

      "selftext_processed": "Not_financial advice . Just sharing how I ’ m looking at United Microelectronics Corporation and why I think it ’ s more interesting than most people realize . Everyone talks about AI chips and cuttingedge nodes but most chips in the world don ’ t need that . UMC focuses on mature and specialty nodes used in the automobile industry industrial equipment power management chips displays IoT devices and networking gear . These markets care more about stability reliability and cost than raw performance . Once a customer designs a chip on UMC ’ s process they usually stick around for years which creates consistent and predictable demand . Over 80 % of global chip volume still comes from mature nodes and that market is not_disappearing anytime soon . With expansions in Singapore UMC wafer volume capacity is set to be 8 million in 2026 . This is about half of that of TSMC but more than other leading global mature node foundries . UMC is not_frozen in the past . The company offers 14nm FinFET technology which gives customers approximately 50–60 % better power efficiency versus 28nm along with improved performance at a reasonable cost . This is ideal for companies that want better chips but don ’ t want to pay premium prices for leadingedge production . UMC does not_need to beat TSMC . It just needs to be dependable and it is . Intel is collaborating with UMC on a 12nm process expected to be manufactured in the United States later this decade . This matters because customers increasingly want less geographic concentration risk . UMC gains access to U.S. manufacturing capacity without building massive new fabs and Intel benefits from UMC ’ s experience running a highmix foundry business . If even 5–10 % of UMC ’ s revenue eventually comes from U.S. manufacturing that alone could justify a higher valuation . It ’ s not_TSMC but the market prices UMC as if growth is basically zero . A 20–30 % rerating over the next few years does not_seem unreasonable if utilization improves the Intel partnership delivers and maturenode demand remains steady . UMC is not_a moonshot but it ’ s more than a boring chip foundry that keeps the world running . This company is trading at a depressed valuation with upside optionality tied to U.S. manufacturing and supplychain diversification . I also believe that this is going to be their year . Volume has been moving like there ’ s something about to be unearthed . It may not_be exciting but boring businesses with low expectations can still make money if they keep executing . UMC has been doing exactly that for a long time ."

      "selftext": "I’m 26 and just recently started taking investing seriously on my own, and I’m feeling a mix of excitement and regret that I’m trying to process. I do have a 401k through work, so it’s not like I had zero exposure to investing. But if I’m being honest, I never really felt like I was investing for myself. I just contributed, picked a default option, and didn’t think about it much. Over the past couple of weeks, I finally built a real budget, automated my savings, opened a Roth IRA, and started consistently investing outside of my job. For the first time, I actually feel in control of my money instead of just letting things happen. That part feels really good. At the same time, I keep catching myself looking backward. I see certain stocks or ETFs with massive long-term returns and my brain immediately goes to “I had money back then, why didn’t I invest on my own?” I know logically that hindsight is 20/20 and that I couldn’t have known what would take off, but emotionally it still feels like FOMO mixed with being hard on myself for not starting sooner. I guess I’m posting because I want to hear from people who’ve been through this phase. Did you feel regret or second-guessing when you started taking investing seriously outside of a 401k? How did you stop comparing where you are now to what could have been and just focus on building forward? I’m committed to staying consistent and playing the long game. I just don’t want hindsight regret to mess with something positive I’m finally building.",

      "selftext": "Even after today’s nosedive the P/E is still at 139. It seems exceedingly high even with Reddit’s strengths. Fundamentally, I do believe the platform itself is probably the best in the market especially compared to Facebook and X which have become flooded with ai slop and bot spam. Financially the company also looks good overall with growing revenue and net income as well as very low debt. However, I’m still skeptical of this valuation by virtue of comparing to Meta. Even Meta only had a P/E in the 70-120 range in its first few years post-IPO with a highest post-IPO P/E of 118. It’s just hard to believe that Reddit will be able to attract users at the same rate as early Meta. What do you think? Is there factors I’m missing?",

Fundamentally I do believe the platform itself is probably the best in the market especially compared to Facebook and X which have become flooded with ai slop and bot spam . Financially the company also looks good overall with growing revenue and net income as well as very low debt . However I ’ m still skeptical of this valuation by virtue of comparing to Meta . Even Meta only had a PE in the 70120 range in its first few years postIPO with a highest postIPO PE of 118 . It ’ s just hard to believe that Reddit will be able to attract users at the same rate as early Meta . What do you think Is there factors I ’ m missing"

      "title": "Three reasons Lilly's orforglipron will end up being as effective as Novo's Wegovy pill",
      "selftext": "Reason 1.) Novo has been heavily marketing Wegovy pill's 16.6% weight loss but that number has to be taken into context. That number comes from the OASIS-4 trial which only had 307 patients. A small number by Phase 3 standards. Also that trial was not diverse at all, it was 79% female and 92% white. Why this matters is because there is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs. So given the small amount of people in the trial, and the fact that there was an over-representation of the most responsive patient type, one can see how that 16.6% weight loss was achieved, and one can see how this won't really be representative of a global population. By comparison, the ATTAIN-1 trial for orforglipron, where we saw 12.4% weight loss, had 3127 patients, 64% female, and 57% white. In orfo's phase 2 they achieved 13.5% weight loss at 36 weeks. That study had 272 patients, 59% female, 91% white. The more females and more whites will give you better weight loss numbers. Reason 2.) We actually have a head-to-head trial in ACHIEVE-3. Yes it was in a diabetic population, but that's a good thing, because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss. In ACHIEVE-3, the 12mg orfo dose (6.7% weight loss) beat the 14mg sema dose (5.3% weight loss). Novo did their own trial in diabetics for oral sema, PIONEER PLUS. In that trial they got 4.7% weight loss for 14mg, and 8.2% for 25mg and 9.6% for 50mg. Looking at the 14mg dose that was used in both trials, we can see the results were similar. now we can compare the 9.2% weight loss from 36mg orfo to the 8.2% from 25mg sema and all the data suggests orfo will be as good, if not even better, than oral sema (at the very least in diabetics). Reason 3.) Results of the ATTAIN-MAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.7/2.4mg to orfo 36mg, they gained back only 1% of their weight. In contrast, the Zepbound 10/15mg arm of the study gained back 5% of their weight. The most interesting number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial. If you average it out, it's about 16% weight loss. This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing for single agonist GLP's. In conclusion, when you look further and further into the data, we will arrive at a logical assertion, that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number. Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world. Everything you hear about Wegovy pill being more efficacious than orforglipron is just marketing, using ONE small study filled with white women who typically respond better to GLP drugs. Orforglipron only had ONE large study in a much more diverse population and the numbers came back \"disappointing\" but as more and more data comes out, you can see the efficacy will be there in the real world.",

      "selftext_processed": "Reason 1 . Novo has been heavily marketing Wegovy pills 16.6 % weight loss but that number has to be taken into context . That number comes from the OASIS4 trial which only had 307 patients . A small number by Phase 3 standards . Also that trial was not_diverse at all it was 79 % female and 92 % white . Why this matters is because there is increasing data that suggests females and whites respond better to GLP drugs . So given the small amount of people in the trial and the fact that there was an overrepresentation of the most responsive patient type one can see how that 16.6 % weight loss was achieved and one can see how this wont really be representative of a global population . By comparison the ATTAIN1 trial for orforglipron where we saw 12.4 % weight loss had 3127 patients 64 % female and 57 % white . In orfos phase 2 they achieved 13.5 % weight loss at 36 weeks . That study had 272 patients 59 % female 91 % white . The more females and more whites will give you better weight loss numbers . Reason 2 . We actually have a headtohead trial in ACHIEVE3 . Yes it was in a diabetic population but thats a good thing because diabetics are harder to treat for weight loss . In ACHIEVE3 the 12mg orfo dose 6.7 % weight loss beat the 14mg sema dose 5.3 % weight loss . Novo did their own trial in diabetics for oral sema PIONEER PLUS . In that trial they got 4.7 % weight loss for 14mg and 8.2 % for 25mg and 9.6 % for 50mg . Looking at the 14mg dose that was used in both trials we can see the results were similar . now we can compare the 9.2 % weight loss from 36mg orfo to the 8.2 % from 25mg sema and all the data suggests orfo will be as good if not_even better than oral sema at the very least in diabetics . Reason 3 . Results of the ATTAINMAINTAIN trial just came out and when patients switched from Wegovy 1.72.4mg to orfo 36mg they gained back only 1 % of their weight . In contrast the Zepbound 1015mg arm of the study gained back 5 % of their weight . The most interesting number is that both arms ended up with the exact same weight by the end of the trial . If you average it out its about 16 % weight loss . This suggests that orfo will stabilize at around that mid teens number that we keep seeing for single agonist GLPs . In conclusion when you look further and further into the data we will arrive at a logical assertion that sufficient GLP agonism will get you to that mid teens weight loss number . Orforglipron will achieve a very similar efficacy to Wegovy pill in the real world . Everything you hear about Wegovy pill being more efficacious than orforglipron is just marketing using ONE small study filled with white women who typically respond better to GLP drugs . Orforglipron only had ONE large study in a much more diverse population and the numbers came back disappointing but as more and more data comes out you can see the efficacy will be there in the real world ."

Adobe, Forward PE of 13 and everyone uses it (also most likely to integrate AI, likely hug rally on that) PayPal, Forward PE of 9. As a business owner online my sales went up 20 percent once I offered a PayPal. In addition who doesn’t use Venmo. LMT, US military backed (they’re double the budget) or also ticker Hii. US is definitely preparing for something so military will benefit MDLZ, Cadbury,Oreos Etc. significantly undervalued due to High Milk,Eggs,Cacao prices that have fallen significantly. They’re set to kill earnings and their PE is 10. TDD, financials are amazing, they maximize ROI as a broker for many businesses. They’re not going anywhere and have had a significant overcorrection. NU is a Brazilian Bank that’s rapidly expanding with great value Devon energy and Oxy-Pet for Oil! Gild and BMY for healthcare picks This is very unpopular today because everyone wants to get rich quick. I read the financials,Balance sheets and look for Margin of safety. When you look at tech you realize AI stocks are mostly gambling at this moment and significantly overvalued. It always ends when people least expect it, I did 80 percent last year. My tech stocks went stupid. Mr Market gave me an offer that was too good. Don’t become desensitized to AI Tech Companies Absurd valuations. Here’s something you should really Really understand about stocks. Do Not Overpay. That means you need to understand financials. 95 percent of retail lose because they think they’re talented and geniuses because the stock goes up. They Lose 95 percent of the time OVER the COURSE of a DECADE because Arrogance->feel justified because price increases-> start to believe they’re better than legends like buffet->Continue investing the same for 5 years. Then they’re left exposed,naked and embarrassed about the ego they had when the NASDAQ crashes 70percent over the course of 3 years like in 2000",

      "selftext": "Source: [ >The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs, adding to the Trump administration’s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S. >Under the agreement, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $250 billion investment in the U.S., the Commerce Department said. In exchange, the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15%, from 20%, and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America. The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week. >The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China. The Trump administration is attempting to de-escalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S. >The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC, which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy. They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products. >TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion, including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan. >“We’re going to bring it all over so we become self-sufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors,” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC. >Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a long-planned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation. Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly, they say. >TSMC’s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan’s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion. China claims the self-ruled island as its own territory, to be seized by force if necessary. >China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently, but some analysts say it wouldn’t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC’s production of chips. That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan, they say. >Under the trade agreement, Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona. The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there. >TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $56 billion on capital expenditures this year, highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source The U.S. and Taiwan signed a trade deal Thursday aimed at boosting American production of semiconductors in exchange for lower tariffs adding to the Trump administration ’ s efforts to bring critical industries to the U.S . Under the agreement Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing will add several new factories to its cluster in Arizona as part of a $ 250 billion investment in the U.S. the Commerce Department said . In exchange the U.S. is cutting tariffs on Taiwanese goods to 15 % from 20 % and exempting Taiwanese chip companies like TSMC that are investing more in America . The contours of the deal were reported earlier in the week . The agreement adds to deals with trading partners including the European Union and Japan and a truce with China . The Trump administration is attempting to deescalate tensions over tariffs to avoid denting the economy while securing added investment in the U.S . The Taiwan deal focuses on semiconductors because of the dominance of TSMC which essentially has a monopoly on making the advanced chips that power the modern economy . They are critical for customers from Nvidia to Apple that want to build data centers for training AI models or sell consumer products . TSMC has received several billion dollars in subsidies through the 2022 Chips and Science Act and will have roughly a dozen plants in Arizona after its latest expansion including some advanced manufacturing capabilities that give it a sizable footprint outside Taiwan . “ We ’ re going to bring it all over so we become selfsufficient in the capacity of building semiconductors ” Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC . Skeptics say TSMC still has most of its footprint in Taiwan and that the U.S. plants represent a longplanned move to reduce risk by building outside the island nation . Creating a meaningful chunk of the global semiconductor supply chain in the U.S. would take decades and be costly they say . TSMC ’ s moves are in focus because the company is a big driver of Taiwan ’ s economy and seen by some observers as a deterrent for a Chinese invasion . China claims the selfruled island as its own territory to be seized by force if necessary . China has taken a more aggressive stance toward Taiwan recently but some analysts say it wouldn ’ t want to tank the global economy by attacking Taiwan and potentially disrupting TSMC ’ s production of chips . That supply also gives the U.S. incentive to protect Taiwan they say . Under the trade agreement Taiwan has committed to help building domestic industrial parks like those TSMC has in Arizona . The company recently bought 900 acres of land to expand its presence there . TSMC said Thursday it plans to spend up to $ 56 billion on capital expenditures this year highlighting unrelenting demand for its chips ."

      "selftext": "To start off, this isn’t one of those “the market will crash posts”. I have no idea when the market will crash. I just want to say the type of growth we see today across many different sectors is different than anything we’ve seen in the past. $SLV is up 45% in a month. $RKLB is up 65% in a month $MU is up 44% in a month Silver, space, semi-conductors - 3 unrelated industries with little in common but the starting letter s. Everywhere, people are saying how it’s “just beginning”. How the dollar is being devalued. How their thing is the “next big thing”. Even if it is, let’s take some time to take in the scale of growth. How sustainable is increasing 1.5x in a month? And this is not just one sector where stocks reflect the greed of investors, it’s 3 unrelated ones. And while this past month has seen extreme growth, there was a lot of growth in all 3 sectors leading up to this as well. I can’t help but think that this is increasingly a market driven by FOMO and hype. Maybe the exponential growth continues and we see 70% growth the next month. Maybe we crash and everything drops 70%. Maybe suddenly everything flattens out and trends towards their more natural growth (likely under 30% a year). But looking at the charts, I have to believe that we are headed towards a culmination point, and something will happen.",

Everywhere people are saying how it ’ s “ just beginning ” . How the dollar is being devalued . How their thing is the “ next big thing ” . Even if it is let ’ s take some time to take in the scale of growth . How sustainable is increasing 1.5x in a month And this is not_just one sector where stocks reflect the greed of investors it ’ s 3 unrelated ones . And while this past month has seen extreme growth there was a lot of growth in all 3 sectors leading up to this as well . I can ’ t help but think that this is increasingly a market driven by FOMO and hype . Maybe the exponential growth continues and we see 70 % growth the next month . Maybe we crash and everything drops 70 % . Maybe suddenly everything flattens out and trends towards their more natural growth likely under 30 % a year . But looking at the charts I have to believe that we are headed towards a culmination point and something will happen ."

      "selftext": "The U.S. and Taiwan have reached a trade agreement to build chips and chip factories on American soil, the Department of Commerce announced on Thursday. As part of the agreement, Taiwanese chip and technology companies will invest at least $250 billion in production capacity in the U.S., and the Taiwanese government will guarantee $250 billion in credit for these companies. In exchange, the U.S. will limit reciprocal tariffs on Taiwan to 15%, down from 20%, and commit to zero reciprocal tariffs on generic pharmaceuticals, their ingredients, aircraft components, and some natural resources. Taiwan Semiconductor has bought land and could expand in Arizona as part of this deal, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC’s Brian Sullivan in an interview on Thursday. “They just bought hundreds of acres adjacent to their property,” Lutnick said. “I’ll let them go through with their board and give them time.” Read more: [",

      "selftext": "Does Google actually gain anything if Gemini isn't branded inside Siri? With the news of the Apple/Google partnership becoming official, there’s a lot of talk about how it will look. Most people assume Apple will bury the Gemini name to keep the \"Siri\" magic alive, but I don’t think that’s realistic. My theory: There has to be Gemini branding in the UI. Here’s why: The \"Why\" for Google: 1. Why would Google trade its most advanced 1.2T parameter model for a reported $1 billion and zero brand recognition? For a company with a $4T market cap, $1B is pocket change. This deal has to be about marketing. 2. User Awareness: If Siri suddenly gets 10x smarter, Google wants that \"halo effect.\" They want Apple users to know it’s Gemini doing the heavy lifting so they don't lose the AI mindshare to OpenAI. 3. The ChatGPT Precedent: Apple already shows \"Powered by ChatGPT\" for certain queries. Why would Google accept anything less? 4. Google's whole motive for this partnership is to get Gemini in front of 2 billion active Apple devices. If there’s no branding, Google achieves nothing but helping their biggest rival catch up. Even if it runs on Apple’s hardware and keeps our data private, I’m willing to bet we see a \"Continue in Gemini\" or \"Gemini results\" tag. 5. Google isn't just a backend provider; they are a brand that needs to win the AI war. They aren't going to be Apple's \"ghostwriter\" for just $1 billion. 6. Google is already not getting the data as per the post by Google on X because of the model running on-device or Apple PCC to upkeep the Apple standard of privacy in the industry Even if the data stays on Apple’s Private Cloud Compute (PCC), I bet we’ll see a \"Gemini\" logo or a \"Powered by\" tagline in the Siri response window. What do you guys think? Would Apple really let Google’s brand sit that close to the core of iOS? Edit:- 6th point",

Google is already not_getting the data as per the post by Google on X because of the model running ondevice or Apple PCC to upkeep the Apple standard of privacy in the industry Even if the data stays on Apple ’ s Private Cloud Compute PCC I bet we ’ ll see a Gemini logo or a Powered by tagline in the Siri response window . What do you guys think Would Apple really let Google ’ s brand sit that close to the core of iOS Edit 6th point"

      "selftext": "The FT argues that the AI-driven surge in data center power demand is accelerating interest in small modular reactors, with large tech companies increasingly signing direct deals with SMR developers to secure reliable, zero-emission, on-site power. Meta is highlighted as a major mover, prepaying for output from up to eight TerraPower Natrium reactors and up to 16 Oklo Aurora reactors, making it one of the largest prospective corporate buyers of nuclear energy. However, the article emphasizes that despite the momentum, SMRs will not materially solve near-term power needs: announced data center–SMR deals are estimated to deliver less than 4GW by 2030 versus potential U.S. data center demand of ~20GW. Long build times remain a constraint, with historical SMR projects often taking close to a decade, though proponents argue SMRs offer advantages in financing, grid integration, and long-term scalability. The author concludes that nuclear’s real value is scale rather than speed, positioning SMRs as a post-2030 solution, while near-term clean energy goals will rely more on extending, uprating, and restarting existing nuclear plants.",

Fair competition is an essential part not only of this industry, but the entire economy. Without it, access vanishes and prices skyrocket. By filing this lawsuit, we are protecting a lawful, essential industry that millions of Americans rely on for their well-being. To those patients who need them, compounded medications are a Godsend.\" >The full complaint can be found here: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Strive Compounding Pharmacy one of the nations most celebrated providers of compounded medications has filed a federal antitrust lawsuit against pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk alleging a coordinated effort to suppress competition and limit patient access to lawful compounded GLP1 medications . The lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas alleges that the defendants used their dominant market positions to undermine the compounding pharmacy industry an established and essential component of the U.S. healthcare system by discouraging providers telehealth platforms and patients from prescribing and accessing compounded GLP1s . For years compounding pharmacies have served as a vital lawful and intentional component for the U.S. healthcare system providing essential tailored medications when massproduced versions either dont fit a patients unique needs or fall into shortage . For us this is more than just a business dispute its a fight for the right of every patient to have access to the medicine their doctor prescribes at a price that isnt dictated by a monopoly said Nate Hill CoFounder and CEO of Strive Compounding Pharmacy . We are standing up to ensure that medical judgment stays between a doctor and their patient—not a pharmaceutical executive and a balance sheet . Fair competition is an essential part not_only of this industry but the entire economy . Without it access vanishes and prices skyrocket . By filing this lawsuit we are protecting a lawful essential industry that millions of Americans rely on for their wellbeing . To those patients who need them compounded medications are a Godsend .

Western Digital stock has done well over the past year rising about 360 % . But SanDisk stock has done even better rising more than 1000 % . SanDisk expects its revenue to continue to grow thanks to increasing demand from AI development for its SSDs and NAND flash memory . Did Western Digital make a mistake in letting go of SanDisk Or will it turn out to be a wise move in the long run"

This exemplifies the classic bullwhip effect: demand from end markets (AI/data centers, advanced process nodes) first materializes at foundries, then propagates upstream with amplified intensity， now beginning to impact equipment suppliers. Foundries are locking in capacity ahead of schedule Equipment manufacturers (lithography, etching, deposition, inspection) will see significantly improved order visibility The industry cycle is shifting from “inventory digestion” to capacity expansion, at least in cutting-edge segments This isn't a miraculous rebound in smartphone demand， it stems from AI-driven increases in process density and capital expenditure per wafer. Even with moderate shipment growth, process complexity continues to climb. Market positioning questions: Foundries vs. equipment suppliers? Front-end equipment vs. back-end/advanced packaging? Or has the market already priced in expectations? The equipment sector may harbor secondary leverage effects.",

      "selftext": "So I just started leasing a car and it fits well into my budget and has helped me put off taking out a loan or using all my savings to pay for a car. I have 3 years to save up money for when my lease ends to either buy that car or go buy a different car. I currently work a job where I have a salary, that covers all of my bills with a little left over after (maybe $500/mo), and a partial commission that helps me earn maybe an extra $100-300 a month on average. I would like to start saving a little every month so when these 3 years are up, I have a good amount saved for my future car purchase. I was thinking about making an additional account on my Sofi app for just this and investing in probably something pretty safe like ETFs. I'm decently versed in investing, so I don't need advice on what to invest in or whatever. My main question is, are there ways to avoid a bunch of fees when I go to take that money out in 3 years? Or will I just have to pay capital gains tax or something? I've never taken money out of my investment accounts before so I have no idea what that process is like. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "So I just started leasing a car and it fits well into my budget and has helped me put off taking out a loan or using all my savings to pay for a car . I have 3 years to save up money for when my lease ends to either buy that car or go buy a different car . I currently work a job where I have a salary that covers all of my bills with a little left over after maybe $ 500mo and a partial commission that helps me earn maybe an extra $ 100300 a month on average . I would like to start saving a little every month so when these 3 years are up I have a good amount saved for my future car purchase . I was thinking about making an additional account on my Sofi app for just this and investing in probably something pretty safe like ETFs . Im decently versed in investing so I dont need advice on what to invest in or whatever . My main question is are there ways to avoid a bunch of fees when I go to take that money out in 3 years Or will I just have to pay capital gains tax or something Ive never_taken money out of my investment accounts before so I have no_idea what that process is like . Thanks"

      "title": "TSMC earnings target up to $56B in 2026 capex and ~30% revenue growth, boosting the AI outlook. Pre-market: TSM +5%, ASML +7%",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $56 billion in capital spending for 2026, a stronger-than-anticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom. >Asia’s most valuable company expects expenditures of $52 billion to $56 billion this year, up at least a quarter from 2025. It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30% in 2026, faster than the average analyst estimate. Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6% to a record in Europe, sending its market value beyond $500 billion. >The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that’s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators. It’s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending. TSMC — Nvidia’s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout, most notably in the US, to sate future demand. >“You’re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not. I’m also very nervous about it,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst’s question on a conference call. “We’re investing $52 billion to $56 billion in capex, right? If we don’t do it carefully, that’d be a big disaster for TSMC.” >Click here for a liveblog on the results. >TSMC reported NT$505.7 billion ($16 billion) in net income for the December quarter, beating the average estimate. That’s off previously reported sales of $33.1 billion in the period, helping the company surpass $100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025. >Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot. That’s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su, who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again. >“TSMC’s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term,” said Gary Tan, a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. >The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips, now surpassing $1 trillion in planned expenditures, has helped TSMC achieve more than 30% annual sales growth over the past two years. But it may also hamper some parts of the company’s business. >An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025, when manufacturers prioritized premium high-bandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips. That’s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices. Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year. >Hsinchu-based TSMC still relies on Apple Inc.’s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc.’s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business. The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026: Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6%. >On Thursday, Wei said his company won’t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as high-end smartphones are still selling well. >TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan. It’s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $165 billion in the US. >It’s also building plants in Japan and Germany, propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home. Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “close the gap” in supply versus demand.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. is earmarking as much as $ 56 billion in capital spending for 2026 a strongerthananticipated projection that signals its confidence in the longevity of the global AI boom . Asia ’ s most valuable company expects expenditures of $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion this year up at least a quarter from 2025 . It also foresees revenue growth of close to 30 % in 2026 faster than the average analyst estimate . Shares in key supplier ASML Holding NV rose 7.6 % to a record in Europe sending its market value beyond $ 500 billion . The outlook from TSMC — a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom — reflects a development frenzy by the likes of Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon Inc. that ’ s spurred demand for Nvidia Corp. accelerators . It ’ s likely to help assuage some concerns about the sustainability of current data center spending . TSMC — Nvidia ’ s main chipmaker — is accelerating its own global capacity buildout most notably in the US to sate future demand . “ You ’ re trying to ask us whether AI demand is real or not_I ’ m also very nervous about it ” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei said in response to an analyst ’ s question on a conference call . “ We ’ re investing $ 52 billion to $ 56 billion in capex right If we don ’ t do it carefully that ’ d be a big disaster for TSMC. ” Click here for a liveblog on the results . TSMC reported NT $ 505.7 billion $ 16 billion in net income for the December quarter beating the average estimate . That ’ s off previously reported sales of $ 33.1 billion in the period helping the company surpass $ 100 billion in annual revenue for the first time in 2025 . Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang this month reaffirmed demand for AI accelerators continues to run hot . That ’ s a sentiment echoed by his Advanced Micro Devices Inc. counterpart Lisa Su who expects the need for more AI computing power and the number of users to surge again . “ TSMC ’ s 2026 guidance underscores AI as a key driver of earnings growth for Asian equities in the near term ” said Gary Tan a portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments . The effort to build and fill data centers with AI chips now surpassing $ 1 trillion in planned expenditures has helped TSMC achieve more than 30 % annual sales growth over the past two years . But it may also hamper some parts of the company ’ s business . An acute memory chip supply crunch emerged in 2025 when manufacturers prioritized premium highbandwidth memory to go with Nvidia and AMD chips . That ’ s forcing consumer electronics makers to hike prices . Industry watchers like IDC are slashing their shipment estimates for this year . Hsinchubased TSMC still relies on Apple Inc. ’ s iPhone and smartphones using Qualcomm Inc. ’ s advanced processors for a substantial portion of its business . The memory crunch is expected to cut into mobile device sales in 2026 Macquarie Capital expects an annual decline for smartphones of 11.6 % . On Thursday Wei said his company won ’ t get impacted by the memory chip crunch this year or next as highend smartphones are still selling well . TSMC will be a key part of an imminent trade deal between the US and Taiwan . It ’ s expected to commit to build more chip fabrication facilities and add to plans to invest as much as $ 165 billion in the US . It ’ s also building plants in Japan and Germany propelling an international expansion while developing the most advanced technology at home . Wei said several times that TSMC will work to “ close the gap ” in supply versus demand ."

      "selftext": "GoGold is a silver miner cosplaying as a gold miner, especially at $90/oz silver. Here’s the breakdown: The Los Ricos mines have 115 million ounces of payable silver (47M at Los Ricos South and 68M at Los Ricos North), as opposed to 665k ounces of gold (424k at Los Ricos South and 221k at Los Ricos North). The AISC (all in sustaining cost), which is basically the average cost to produce one ounce of silver and keep the mine running long term, is only around $10–12 for both mines. That makes it one of the very few Tier-1 silver assets in the world, with decent margins when the feasibility study was conducted at sub $30/oz silver and insane margins above $90/oz. Yet despite being a Tier-1 silver asset, while the silver price has been going nuts and every silver miner on the market has been going to the moon, GoGold has been lagging behind with the gold miners. Why? Because it’s relatively tiny in terms of market cap ($886M which is nuts if you’ve done a NAV calc at $90 silver), and most people seem to think it’s a gold miner… probably because it’s named “GoGold.” Finally, while most development stage miners are cash black holes, GoGold is already profitable and generating positive cash flow due to its tailings project. That’s a great sign in an industry full of executives who don’t seem to believe their mines ever need to be profitable. Anyway, if you feel like you missed the silver run up, this is a Tier-1 silver asset hiding in plain sight that hasn’t moved with silver.",

      "title": "Who dominates the market for Suboxone generics? Dr. Reddy or Viatras / Mylan? 7-Hydroxymitragynine epidemic and extreme rise in Suboxone.",
      "selftext": "Across the U.S. Suboxone prescriptions are rapidly increasing as states implement restrictions or outright bans on 7-hydroxymitragynine (7OH). As access to 7OH becomes more limited, many users are swiftly transitioned to generic Suboxone as part of their treatment plan. If you delve into the Quitting 7OH thread, you’ll notice a significant number of users describing their placement on Suboxone. For many, stopping 7OH serves as a temporary bridge to Suboxone, while for others, it becomes a long-term solution. This situation raises a serious public health concern. Withdrawal from 7OH is often described as more severe and destabilizing compared to withdrawal from traditional prescription opioids, including extreme sensory disturbances. This severity is particularly concerning given that 7OH has been widely accessible through gas stations and smoke/vape shops with minimal regulation. Another overlooked aspect is the diverse group of individuals affected. Many users are not stereotypical “drug users.” They are professionals with careers, families, and responsibilities who were drawn to 7OH due to the perception that it was legal, safer, or easier to manage than prescription opioids. As bans take effect, most prescriptions are being filled with generic buprenorphine/naloxone films, primarily from manufacturers like Dr. Reddy’s and Viatris (formerly Mylan). From a systems perspective, this transition appears less like harm reduction and more like a rapid shift of dependence from an unregulated substance to long-term medication-assisted treatment. This creates a paradoxical situation: On one hand, this is a growing public health issue that requires regulation, informed consent, and long-term outcomes. On the other hand, it represents a structural shift that benefits a select few pharmaceutical manufacturers who are positioned to capitalize on the demand generated by these bans. While I oppose the idea of profiting from addiction or regulatory failure, overlooking the economic incentives embedded in this transition seems naive. If a legally sold substance leads a significant population into lifelong treatment, it has far-reaching implications for patients, providers, policy, healthcare costs, and markets. I’m curious to understand others perspectives on this matter: Are we effectively addressing the problem, or are we merely shifting it into a more institutionalized and profitable form?",

      "selftext_processed": "Across the U.S. Suboxone prescriptions are rapidly increasing as states implement restrictions or outright bans on 7hydroxymitragynine 7OH . As access to 7OH becomes more limited many users are swiftly transitioned to generic Suboxone as part of their treatment plan . If you delve into the Quitting 7OH thread you ’ ll notice a significant number of users describing their placement on Suboxone . For many stopping 7OH serves as a temporary bridge to Suboxone while for others it becomes a longterm solution . This situation raises a serious public health concern . Withdrawal from 7OH is often described as more severe and destabilizing compared to withdrawal from traditional prescription opioids including extreme sensory disturbances . This severity is particularly concerning given that 7OH has been widely accessible through gas stations and smokevape shops with minimal regulation . Another overlooked aspect is the diverse group of individuals affected . Many users are not_stereotypical “ drug users. ” They are professionals with careers families and responsibilities who were drawn to 7OH due to the perception that it was legal safer or easier to manage than prescription opioids . As bans take effect most prescriptions are being filled with generic buprenorphinenaloxone films primarily from manufacturers like Dr. Reddy ’ s and Viatris formerly Mylan . From a systems perspective this transition appears less like harm reduction and more like a rapid shift of dependence from an unregulated substance to longterm medicationassisted treatment . This creates a paradoxical situation On one hand this is a growing public health issue that requires regulation informed consent and longterm outcomes . On the other hand it represents a structural shift that benefits a select few pharmaceutical manufacturers who are positioned to capitalize on the demand generated by these bans . While I oppose the idea of profiting from addiction or regulatory failure overlooking the economic incentives embedded in this transition seems naive . If a legally sold substance leads a significant population into lifelong treatment it has farreaching implications for patients providers policy healthcare costs and markets . I ’ m curious to understand others perspectives on this matter Are we effectively addressing the problem or are we merely shifting it into a more institutionalized and profitable form"

      "selftext": "I got tired of screening stocks by just pe ratio and getting a list of value traps so I started looking into what metrics actually have predictive power. Turns out there's decent academic research on this. High roic combined with low reinvestment needs tends to compound wealth over time. Makes sense because youre buying businesses that generate excess returns and dont need to plow everything back in just to maintain competitive position. Debt coverage matters more than absolute debt levels. A company with moderate debt but strong interest coverage is safer than a company with low debt but weak cash generation. Gross margin stability over 5 to 10 years is a better moat indicator than any single year snapshot. If margins are consistent through different economic cycles, theres probably something protecting the business. Payout ratios below 60% for dividend stocks. Once you get above that youre betting on earnings growth just to maintain the dividend which adds risk. Free cash flow yield matters more than earnings yield because earnings can be manipulated way easier than actual cash coming in. None of this is revolutionary but combining these filters actually produces a pretty different list than just sorting by pe. Way fewer names but higher quality.",

Turns out theres decent academic research on this . High roic combined with low reinvestment needs tends to compound wealth over time . Makes sense because youre buying businesses that generate excess returns and dont need to plow everything back in just to maintain competitive position . Debt coverage matters more than absolute debt levels . A company with moderate debt but strong interest coverage is safer than a company with low debt but weak cash generation . Gross margin stability over 5 to 10 years is a better moat indicator than any single year snapshot . If margins are consistent through different economic cycles theres probably something protecting the business . Payout ratios below 60 % for dividend stocks . Once you get above that youre betting on earnings growth just to maintain the dividend which adds risk . Free cash flow yield matters more than earnings yield because earnings can be manipulated way easier than actual cash coming in . None of this is revolutionary but combining these filters actually produces a pretty different list than just sorting by pe . Way fewer names but higher quality ."

It feels like many big companies today are no longer built around delivering genuinely good products or services to customers. Instead, the focus seems to be on maximizing short term returns for investors and shareholders, even if that hurts product quality or customer experience. We see this in things like price increases, worse customer service, more subscriptions, and constant cost cutting, while CEOs and executives seem more focused on stock prices and quarterly numbers than on whether customers are actually happy. Once a sale is made, it often feels like the customer becomes secondary. I get that profits and investors matter, but customers are the ones who create that money. Without trust and long term loyalty, how sustainable is this model really? Has capitalism shifted to an investor first system, or am I just seeing the worst examples?

      "selftext": "I’ve been looking at Uber ($UBER) over the past few days. Stock seems to be under the radar of a lot of investors. Does anyone here have strong conviction either way on UBER (up or down)? Autonomous driving and robotaxis could be a threat but also could be a massive opportunity. Labor is one of the biggest costs for UBER…and if you eliminate the drivers it would be massively accretive. They have a partnership with Waymo, which in my mind is further ahead with autonomous driving tech than is TSLA. Investors are willing to give a massive valuation bump to TSLA for robotaxis but nothing for UBER. Seems like a disconnect to me. Robotaxis could be an existential threat to UBER. But I don’t see it. In the meantime, they are still growing revenues at 20% or greater, generating a lot of cash and shrinking the share count. Thoughts either bullish or bearish??",

Does anyone here have strong conviction either way on UBER up or down Autonomous driving and robotaxis could be a threat but also could be a massive opportunity . Labor is one of the biggest costs for UBER…and if you eliminate the drivers it would be massively accretive . They have a partnership with Waymo which in my mind is further ahead with autonomous driving tech than is TSLA . Investors are willing to give a massive valuation bump to TSLA for robotaxis but nothing_for UBER . Seems like a disconnect to me . Robotaxis could be an existential threat to UBER . But I don ’ t see it . In the meantime they are still growing revenues at 20 % or greater generating a lot of cash and shrinking the share count . Thoughts either bullish or bearish"

Over the holidays a close family member passed away and just this week, I found out they left me a huge surprise... $500,000 in a Schwab account and $50k cash. I have no idea what stocks/bonds/etfs/etc. it is invested in yet, nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall. My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash , but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road. Some information on our current financial situation: We own our home valued at $360k still owing $278k with a 2.75% interest rate. I have $26k in a personal brokerage account. $3k in a Roth IRA, $25k in my company 401k and make an annual pre-tax wage of about $90k - $100k with salary and overtime. The Wife makes around $90k annually as well, with only $3k in a Roth IRA. No other investments. We've only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs. We have a vehicle loan with $9k left on it, and a solar loan with about $10k left on it. No other debt (besides the previously mentioned mortgage). As I stated, I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation. Any insight is welcome.",

I have no_idea what stocksbondsetfsetc . it is invested in yet nor any idea on how to handle this life changing windfall . My wife and I have a few ideas for the cash but this is an amount I only ever dreamed of having and certainly dont want to squander it or make a mistake that I will regret decades down the road . Some information on our current financial situation We own our home valued at $ 360k still owing $ 278k with a 2.75 % interest rate . I have $ 26k in a personal brokerage account . $ 3k in a Roth IRA $ 25k in my company 401k and make an annual pretax wage of about $ 90k $ 100k with salary and overtime . The Wife makes around $ 90k annually as well with only $ 3k in a Roth IRA . No_other investments . Weve only had these well paying jobs for about 2yrs . We have a vehicle loan with $ 9k left on it and a solar loan with about $ 10k left on it . No_other debt besides the previously mentioned mortgage . As I stated I am completely over my head with this amount of money and am looking for guidance on how to navigate this situation . Any insight is welcome ."

      "selftext": "A few days ago, I was watching a YouTube video with car content, and they said that sales of luxury cars have declined, which is true, but Ferrari is not included in that. Lamborghini belongs to the VW Group (along with Audi). They are awesome cars, but the brand appeals more to \"New Money\" (Crypto, YouTubers, Influencers). It is more vulnerable to trends.The biggest mistake investors make is comparing Ferrari to car manufacturers. Founder, Enzo Ferrari said, \"Always build one car less than the market demands.\" It doesn't sell transportation. It sells access to an exclusive club. Ferrari has exceptional finances and locked-in revenue for the next two years as it operates on a pre-order basis. Due to inflation, materials have become more expensive. Ferrari raised its prices by 10-15%. Did anyone cancel their order? No. Its customers do not look at the price. This protects its profits from inflation. The average Ferrari customer has many cars in their garage. They do not buy a Ferrari to go to work. They buy it as a collector's item. In a crisis, you are not affected because we are not talking about people who are financially insecure, but about millionaires. The respect that the company itself shows for its product is very important, with its customer base, blacklist, and strict penalties in case of resale or conversion of the car, giving even more the impression that this is not a car company but a company with works of art. I believe that the decline in share price is occurring for similar reasons as with Google and Uber at the moment. There is a lot of pessimism and speculation (Ferrari is preparing to launch its first all-electric (EV) car in late 2025/early 2026), which will be forgotten over time as it is not very well-founded. This is an exceptional company that has proven many times that every decline acts as a bounce-back spring and acts as a counterweight in bear markets. **I would be happy to hear opposing views in case I am missing something.**",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been in the market since 2020 and I’m looking for advice on dollar cost averaging (DCA). If you had 40k to invest across 5-6 stocks, how would you approach DCA? Over what time period would you deploy the capital? Does the DCA timeline depend on the stock, or do you follow a fixed schedule? Do you keep cash on the side, and if so, how much? Or are you 100% invested? Some of these stocks are already down ~20% over the past 5–6 months, which makes timing even harder. My biggest problem is thinking I’m buying the bottom when I’m not. I know timing the bottom is nearly impossible, but even using charts, I still deploy capital too early and end up with no cash left while the stock continues to fall. Are there any practical rules or frameworks you use to manage this especially to avoid deploying capital too fast? Appreciate any insights.",

      "selftext": "Any military action against Greenland immediately escalates into a transatlantic crisis. At best, the U.S. would face sweeping sanctions from the EU and allied economies. At worst, it could spark an armed conflict between NATO members, something the global financial system is absolutely not built to handle. Markets hate uncertainty, and this would be uncertainty on a historic scale. Trade between the U.S. and Europe would likely be disrupted or frozen, shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Arctic would be militarized, and global supply chains would seize up almost overnight. Energy prices would spike, markets would panic, and investor confidence would evaporate. The U.S. economy is especially vulnerable here because it’s heavily dependent on globalized, high tech supply chains. Semiconductors, rare earth processing, advanced manufacturing none of these exist in isolation. If relations with Europe and allied nations collapse, access to critical components and materials would be severely constrained. A tech-driven economy can’t function if it can’t get chips, equipment, or precision manufacturing machinery. Beyond the immediate economic damage, the long-term consequences would be even worse: capital flight from U.S. markets, a weakened dollar, and a permanent loss of trust in America as a stable anchor of the global system. A move like this won't just be a geopolitical mistake; it would be economic turmoil on a scale we haven't seen in a long time.",

At best the U.S. would face sweeping sanctions from the EU and allied economies . At worst it could spark an armed conflict between NATO members something the global financial system is absolutely not_built to handle . Markets hate uncertainty and this would be uncertainty on a historic scale . Trade between the U.S. and Europe would likely be disrupted or frozen shipping lanes in the North Atlantic and Arctic would be militarized and global supply chains would seize up almost overnight . Energy prices would spike markets would panic and investor confidence would evaporate . The U.S. economy is especially vulnerable here because it ’ s heavily dependent on globalized high tech supply chains . Semiconductors rare earth processing advanced manufacturing none of these exist in isolation . If relations with Europe and allied nations collapse access to critical components and materials would be severely constrained .

      "selftext": "U.S. stock futures moved lower as traders reacted to Wall Street’s first consecutive losses in 2026. Futures tied to the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all slipped, signaling a cautious open after recent selling pressure ended the market’s early-year momentum. The pullback reflects a mix of profit taking, sector rotation, and uncertainty around macro conditions, with tech stocks facing the most pressure in recent sessions. After a strong start to the year, some traders appear to be reassessing risk and waiting for clearer signals from earnings and economic data. For now, the softer futures suggest markets may stay range bound in the short term, as investors balance longer term optimism with near term caution. Whether this turns into a deeper correction or just a pause will likely depend on upcoming data and broader market sentiment.",

Commoditys is where smart people have had a safe haven against the rigged ass market for quite some time . After all no_ones big enough to influence the price of something so common as silver worldwide becouse someone with silver will just cash out . But thats where they went wrong Theres so much wealth at the top we are nearing an era where even the price of something so common as a chicken egg can be manipulated to 100x its current price and substained for a long time . Sure a chicken farmer is in heaven in this scenario . But the top bought out all of the farms and since 99 % of folk live in cities whos left to keep markets honest Same for silver . By the time someone middle class sets up an egg farming operation in their country vacation property the price has already receded . Do you know anyone irl who is mining silver or hoarding large amounts If the common man has no_silver to cash out then theres nothing_to keep the price honest and guess who owns the mining companies your percieved value of something is meaningless . You could say google is a 100 trillion dollar company and be right if you have all the wealth becouse thats the magic of wash trading . Whos left to sell shares of google Real shares not_borrowed ones . meanwhile the influence drips up too . Not_just money . If google is worth 5 trillion only a few people know why and at any moment could reverse the scheme and wipe out half its value . Thats some serious leverage over the executive suite off the books . but be thankful . Becouse some day maybe years from now the masses will finally catch on . And when they do the market will crash . Your retirement account only rises now becouse people buy puts and short stocks . But some day when all the bears are gone theyll come feasting for the buy and hold crew . for now your longs help fund wash up . And so you feel like a smart person becouse all you did was set money aside with no_effort . Some day that free lunch will stop being free ."

I am by no means competent in the space (data security/ cloud data management), but am enticed by their growth and great margins. I am providing a link in the comments to their Q3 earnings report and 2 prior RBRK threads from this sub in the past. *Key Q3 earnings takeaways-* Subscription ARR grew 34% yoy to $1.35B. 3rd quarter revenue grew 48% yoy to $350M. 2,638 customers with $100k or more in subscription ARR; 27% increase yoy. Upon announcing Q3 earnings the share price spiked 25% to 92.77 and has since slowly gave back all those gains. Share price closed at $68.14 at the end of today’s trading session. I understand they will be trying to claw market share away from several more established players in the space (Okta, Panw, Zscaler, Crowdstrike, etc) … anybody else think they can continue chipping away & gaining market share? Open to any and all discussion; especially from those with knowledge of the industry and/or work in the field and use their products.",

It’s a full time job where I get paid 30$ an hour and work 8 hours a day. I have no bills and no debts. I literally can invest or save all my money earned I just don’t know how. The job offers benefits but I’m not too knowledgable on them. I also have a 10K from grad party. What are things I should be taught before I start working even longer from now? 30$ an hour is decent money at 19. For more info I live with a friend who covers everything. That’s why I have no bills or debt. It’s why I even have the job. Now how do I invest to become rich or just well off?",

      "selftext": "I've been studying for a while the market history. The \"time in the market\" saying is true; if you get the US stock market 200-year average, even the 1929 crash feels more like a correction than what it really was. 2020 is just a blip in the bigger scheme of things. But we all aren't likely to even see 2100, so our time in the market isn't that great. Some of those blips are huge things for a single lifetime, hence the question. At what point a correction and a \"fasten your seatbelts\" scenario actually becomes a general disaster that will ruin a lot of people and take years to recover? For example, all the signs in April would point to a major downturn in the following months. Seeing it now, in the end it was just a small bump on the road. Even in the pandemic, everyone was somewhat able to foreshadow the shit hitting the fan (the S&P 500 began to fall down in mid-late february 2020, and we all were seeing huge news everywhere since december 2019). Anyone with a minor glance of the news could see what was likely to come in the following months. Now in 2026, everyone is talking of AI bubble, another global recession in the likes of 2008, an apocalyptical disaster scenario where everything starting falling from the sky. But for someone investing, what would be the line (or zone) between keeping the stocks during a poor month, and outright selling them all to avoid being hit by a crisis? What could be the next triggers for it to happen?",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been studying for a while the market history . The time in the market saying is true if you get the US stock market 200year average even the 1929 crash feels more like a correction than what it really was . 2020 is just a blip in the bigger scheme of things . But we all arent likely to even see 2100 so our time in the market isnt that great . Some of those blips are huge things for a single lifetime hence the question . At what point a correction and a fasten your seatbelts scenario actually becomes a general disaster that will ruin a lot of people and take years to recover For example all the signs in April would point to a major downturn in the following months . Seeing it now in the end it was just a small bump on the road . Even in the pandemic everyone was somewhat able to foreshadow the shit hitting the fan the SP 500 began to fall down in midlate february 2020 and we all were seeing huge news everywhere since december 2019 . Anyone with a minor glance of the news could see what was likely to come in the following months . Now in 2026 everyone is talking of AI bubble another global recession in the likes of 2008 an apocalyptical disaster scenario where everything starting falling from the sky . But for someone investing what would be the line or zone between keeping the stocks during a poor month and outright selling them all to avoid being hit by a crisis What could be the next triggers for it to happen"

      "selftext": "Listen up you beautiful financially illiterate degenerates, put down the SPY 0DTE lotto tickets for 30 seconds and use your 2 remaining brain cells. MDA Space (MDA.TO) (MDALF) for OTC is an actual space company, not another fake AI “cloud-enabled synergies” scam. These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they’re a full-on “international space mission partner” doing satellite systems, space robotics, and geo-intelligence. Translation: they make the robot arms that grab space junk, build the metal sky-wafers that beam your doomscrolling, and sell government-grade spy-pictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit. They build and operate satellite constellations for communications, Earth and space observation, and exploration infrastructure. Their customers are governments and big-boy contractors, not Dave from Robinhood on margin. THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “MDA Ltd.” to “MDA Space” in 2024, which is marketing-speak for “please give us a space stonk multiple.” As of mid-January 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD, after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists. You’re telling me clapped-up EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations, but an actual space hardware and geo-intel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a low-effort meme post? Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon’s space money, so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself. And while you smoothbrains are dumpster-diving weekly options, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “move quickly, embrace risks, be bold” with new tech and space systems. If the guy running the world’s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware, maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites, robotics, and geo-intel isn’t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $200 CAD",

These Canadian nerds have been building space tech since the 60s and now they ’ re a fullon “ international space mission partner ” doing satellite systems space robotics and geointelligence . Translation they make the robot arms that grab space junk build the metal skywafers that beam your doomscrolling and sell governmentgrade spypictures so your bagholding gets watched from orbit . They build and operate satellite constellations for communications Earth and space observation and exploration infrastructure . Their customers are governments and bigboy contractors not_Dave from Robinhood on margin . THINK GOLDEN DOME They even rebranded from “ MDA Ltd. ” to “ MDA Space ” in 2024 which is marketingspeak for “ please give us a space stonk multiple. ” As of midJanuary 2026 the thing trades around the high 20s CAD after ripping last year into the 40s before the apes collectively discovered zero day options again and forgot Canada exists . You ’ re telling me clappedup EV penny stocks can trade at nosebleed valuations but an actual space hardware and geointel shop with real government contracts is stuck on the TSX begging for volume like a loweffort meme post Pete Hegseth is now literally the guy in charge of handing out the Pentagon ’ s space money so the MDA ape thesis basically writes itself . And while you smoothbrains are dumpsterdiving weekly options Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is out touring Starbase and yelling at defense contractors to “ move quickly embrace risks be bold ” with new tech and space systems . If the guy running the world ’ s biggest military budget wants less bloated bureaucracy and more orbital hardware maybe just maybe an actual Canadian space shop with satellites robotics and geointel isn ’ t the dumbest place to park a few loonies PT $ 200 CAD"

I make about **$2,600/month net**, work full time as a software engineer, and still live with my parents so my expenses aren’t that high. No other income. Right now I’ve got roughly **$24k total**: * about **$18k in gold** (4 oz) * **$1.5k stocks** * **$2.2k crypto** * **$2.5k cash** I’m considering buying an apartment for **$115k**. It’s **83 sqm, 2 bedrooms**, building is around **25 years old**, quiet area close to where I live. Rent would probably be: * **~$500/month unfurnished** * **~$600/month furnished**, but I’d need to buy furniture first To do this I’d basically have to liquidate most of what I own, put **$25k down**, and take a **$90k loan at 6% interest**. That’s pretty much the only housing loan option here. My idea was to try and **pay it off fast** (maybe ~7 years if I really push it), keep it rented, and then maybe use it later to buy another place. What I’m struggling with: * Is this actually a decent move or am I forcing my first real estate deal? * Selling gold for this feels risky… but also holding it forever feels like doing nothing * Am I missing something obvious (maintenance, vacancies, bad math, etc.)? If you were in my situation, would you do this or just stay liquid and wait? Appreciate any thoughts.",

      "selftext": "Background: M28, good income, high risk tolerance. Current portfolio: 50% in stocks, 20% in SPYM, 20% in target date 401k, 10% in cash. I'm relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research. In March 2025, my portfolio was down 30% and it really didn't bother me one bit. The only issue I had was that since I was already 100% invested, I didn't have cash to buy more at the discounted prices :( Next time when something like this happens, I want to be able to make the best use of it. 1. Should I keep some money in gold, silver or bonds? If yes, how much? I don't care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term. 3. I read a research paper suggesting 100% equities for long horizon, but then I will have the same problem as last year. Maybe I can go 100% equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index. When the downturn comes, sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts. 3. I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity. Thoughts? I'd appreciate any suggestions. It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers, blogposts, etc. Thank you very much!!",

      "selftext_processed": "Background M28 good income high risk tolerance . Current portfolio 50 % in stocks 20 % in SPYM 20 % in target date 401k 10 % in cash . Im relatively new in my investment journey but I have done a fair amount of research . In March 2025 my portfolio was down 30 % and it really didnt bother me one bit . The only issue I had was that since I was already 100 % invested I didnt have cash to buy more at the discounted prices Next time when something like this happens I want to be able to make the best use of it . 1 . Should I keep some money in gold silver or bonds If yes how much I dont care about short term fluctuations and want highest expected returns in the long term . 3 . I read a research paper suggesting 100 % equities for long horizon but then I will have the same problem as last year . Maybe I can go 100 % equities but keep a big chunk of it in a broad index . When the downturn comes sell some of it to buy high conviction stocks trading at more extreme discounts . 3 . I am also thinking of changing my pension funds from target date to fully broad market equity . Thoughts Id appreciate any suggestions . It will be really helpful if you could point me to some good resources like research papers blogposts etc . Thank you very much"

      "selftext": "While I understand that simple small Software in Teams of few people can be replaced by ai written Software, I don‘t get theis Thesis for Big Software Companies that are deeply integrated in the Industry Ecosystem as Single Source of Truth! A Short summary by ai of my thoughts: While AI is changing how we work, established giants like SAP, Salesforce, and DocuSign remain indispensable because they provide the reliability, features and trust that you can not get from self build and self sustained Software. Key Arguments: \\- All These complex System have started as simpler systems, the „unecessary“ are there for a reason Most of a time and as soon as Self Development solutions get more Mature they will get too complex to self sustain. That‘s the Point companies will have to Switch back to the big realiable systems. \\- Mission-Critical Stability: Traditional enterprise systems offer much higher \"up-time\" guarantees than self coded Software that unexperienced vibe coders developed. In business, a 0.1% difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster. \\- Built-in Standards: These platforms are already the \"plumbing\" of the business world. They integrate seamlessly into complex industries (like finance and healthcare) where security and regulations are non-negotiable. \\- Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it‘s essential that people can start with Software they already know. Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit, in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with. \\- AI as an Upgrade, Not a Replacement: Instead of being replaced by AI, these companies are absorbing it. By adding AI features (to their already trusted foundations, they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data. Docusign for example is not where it is because it‘s a signature Solution, but it’s a **trustworthy** signature Solution with a „history“. **You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks, but you won‘t build the trust!** The Bottom Line: You can't run a global business on \"smart\" self developed tools alone; you need tools that are proven to do their job, scale and guaranteed not to fail. **Is there something I don‘t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again?** edit: tried to improve the ai slop (critic was justified)",

Key Arguments All These complex System have started as simpler systems the „ unecessary “ are there for a reason Most of a time and as soon as Self Development solutions get more Mature they will get too complex to self sustain . That ‘ s the Point companies will have to Switch back to the big realiable systems . MissionCritical Stability Traditional enterprise systems offer much higher uptime guarantees than self coded Software that unexperienced vibe coders developed . In business a 0.1 % difference in reliability can mean the difference between a smooth operation and a costly disaster . Builtin Standards These platforms are already the plumbing of the business world . They integrate seamlessly into complex industries like finance and healthcare where security and regulations are nonnegotiable . Also to be able to switch your Job without to have to learn a new tool someone developed with ai it ‘ s essential that people can start with Software they already know . Having paid Standards that every one knows is a benefit in contrast to free that everybody has to get familiar with . AI as an Upgrade Not_a Replacement Instead of being replaced by AI these companies are absorbing it . By adding AI features to their already trusted foundations they offer a safe way for businesses to innovate without risking their core data . Docusign for example is not_where it is because it ‘ s a signature Solution but it ’ s a trustworthy signature Solution with a „ history “ . You might vibe code a similar Solution in a few weeks but you won ‘ t build the trust The Bottom Line You cant run a global business on smart self developed tools alone you need tools that are proven to do their job scale and guaranteed not_to fail . Is there something I don ‘ t see or understand or Why are Software Stocks are getting sold off again edit tried to improve the ai slop critic was justified"

      "selftext": "**Current Price:** \\~GBX 123 / CAD 2.29 **Market Cap:** \\~£580m / CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer, beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year. You are buying a high-grade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks (JPM, Goldman) forecast gold to hit $4,000-$5,000/oz in 2026. The kicker? The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China, and Amaroq holds the keys to the region's copper and strategic minerals. **1. The Cash Flow Engine is Live** Most junior miners fail because they can't build the mine. Amaroq has crossed that bridge. * **Production Beat:** They just reported FY2025 production of \\~6,600 oz, beating the midpoint of their 6-7koz guidance. * **High Grade:** This is a narrow-vein deposit with historical grades of 18-28 g/t.High grade protects margins if prices dip. * **Phase 2 Catalyst:** The real re-rate happens in Q2 2026. They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to \\~90%.This is pure margin expansion. **2. The Macro Setup (Gold Supercycle)** The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices, but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 2026/2027: * **J.P. Morgan:** Forecasts $5,055/oz by Q4 2026. * **Bank of America:** Sees upside to $5,000/oz.If gold goes to $4,000+, Amaroq's free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely self-fund their massive exploration portfolio, eliminating the need for dilution. **3. The Geopolitical \"Put\" Option** This is the unique value driver. The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of China's control. * **Strategic Assets:** Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt (potential IOCG system) and Stendalen (Nickel/PGM). * **US Government Funding:** CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support. * **The Moat:** If the US wants Greenland's minerals, Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region. **Valuation & Asymmetry** The stock trades like a developer, but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer. You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copper/strategic minerals and the \"US National Security\" premium for free. **Key Risks** * **Nugget Effect:** The gold is coarse and erratic. Quarterly production will be volatile. You have to look at annual averages, not quarterly misses/beats. * **Execution:** They need to deliver Phase 2 on time (Q2 2026) to hit the 90% recovery targets. * **Logistics:** It's the Arctic. Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements.",

      "selftext_processed": "Current Price GBX 123 CAD 2.29 Market Cap £580m CAD 1.06B Amaroq just transitioned from a developer to a producer beating its FY2025 production guidance during a commissioning year . You are buying a highgrade gold mine that is ramping up exactly as major banks JPM Goldman forecast gold to hit $ 4000 $ 5000oz in 2026 . The kicker The US government is actively looking to invest in Greenland to counter China and Amaroq holds the keys to the regions copper and strategic minerals . 1 . The Cash Flow Engine is Live Most junior miners fail because they cant build the mine . Amaroq has crossed that bridge . Production Beat They just reported FY2025 production of 6600 oz beating the midpoint of their 67koz guidance . High Grade This is a narrowvein deposit with historical grades of 1828 gt.High grade protects margins if prices dip . Phase 2 Catalyst The real rerate happens in Q2 2026 . They are installing a flotation circuit to boost recovery rates to 90 % .This is pure margin expansion . 2 . The Macro Setup Gold Supercycle The valuation looks reasonable at current gold prices but it looks like a steal if you believe the institutional consensus for 20262027 J.P. Morgan Forecasts $ 5055oz by Q4 2026 . Bank of America Sees upside to $ 5000oz.If gold goes to $ 4000 Amaroqs free cash flow from the Nalunaq mine alone could likely selffund their massive exploration portfolio eliminating the need for dilution . 3 . The Geopolitical Put Option This is the unique value driver . The US is scrambling to secure critical minerals outside of Chinas control . Strategic Assets Amaroq owns the Sava Copper Belt potential IOCG system and Stendalen NickelPGM . US Government Funding CEO Eldur Olafsson confirmed they are in discussions with US agencies regarding direct investment and infrastructure support . The Moat If the US wants Greenlands minerals Amaroq is the primary industrial partner in the region . Valuation Asymmetry The stock trades like a developer but the risk profile has shifted to that of a producer . You are effectively paying for the gold mine and getting the copperstrategic minerals and the US National Security premium for free . Key Risks Nugget Effect The gold is coarse and erratic . Quarterly production will be volatile . You have to look at annual averages not_quarterly missesbeats . Execution They need to deliver Phase 2 on time Q2 2026 to hit the 90 % recovery targets . Logistics Its the Arctic . Weather can delay shipments and increase working capital requirements ."

      "selftext": "On January 14, spot silver surged past $92/oz, up nearly 6% on the day. New York silver also jumped about 6% to $91.57/oz. So far this year, silver is already up around 25%. The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data, along with ongoing physical supply shortages. I’ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time. Tin was up nearly 40% last year, and is already up more than 25% so far in 2026. Indonesia is the world’s second largest tin producer how do people view that market? Do you think this move is just a CPI-driven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven? Is this part of a bigger longer term trend?",

So far this year silver is already up around 25 % . The rally in precious metals has been driven by rising expectations for Fed rate cuts after the release of the December CPI data along with ongoing physical supply shortages . I ’ ve also noticed industrial metals moving higher at the same time . Tin was up nearly 40 % last year and is already up more than 25 % so far in 2026 . Indonesia is the world ’ s second largest tin producer how do people view that market Do you think this move is just a CPIdriven panic spike or is it more of a real stress test for U.S. equities with capital rotating out of stocks and into precious metals as a safe haven Is this part of a bigger longer term trend"

Before this though, I solely just invested in Robinhood but that was before I was financially more literate. I’m trying to rebalance my portfolio because I should have done this much sooner. I just want to hear some opinions on it. I’m taking each with a grain of salt or heavy research after. My approach Roth IRA = growth stocks (VTI, SPY, VOO) Robinhood = Income Focused (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI) The plan is to retire off of dividends but also have a good savings account. I’m currently 25 and my income is nothing fancy. My robinhood is roughly reaching 20k but that’s because so have a good mix of growth stocks and dividend stocks in it.",

You know what is out of fashion? Competence. You know what is in fashion? Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $35. And you know who is letting it happen? Alaska Airlines - they know *all about it* but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart. This isn't an airline. It is a distressed fintech with planes attached, run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus. **I am Short Alaska Airlines. Here is the dirt.** But if your smooth-brains don't want to read or think, just jam this [report]( into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic? It will tell you to short at the double. # 1. The \"Penalty Box\" Infinite Loop (Tech is F*cked) In 2022, some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury. It was a last-minute ticket, and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never knew until it was too late. ALK agreed to give his points back as a \"one-time courtesy,\" but then punished the **victim** by permanently banning them from booking online. They have to call a phone line (open 9-5) to use their own points forever. Fast forward 4 years to 2026. They haven't fixed a single line of code. It is the exact same robbery. Exact same response. Only now, hackers are running a train on Alaska. Look at the scoreboard: 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025. \"370? Who cares?\" you ask, wiping Cheeto dust on your wife's boyfriend's couch. Listen to me. More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of mile-sniffers. 41 came from a niche Chinese-language chat room (US Card Forum) with only 12,000 weekly visitors. That is the tip of the iceberg. If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit, the real number across the 12 million normies who don't check their accounts daily is in the **tens of thousands**. An airline with tech so jacked they can't even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no place in the modern world. # 2. The \"This is America\" Factor Now, I'm not a complete moron. I know how this works. Leaking 100,000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats? Ha, this is America. Nobody will care about that. Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up. But this is more than that. # 3. The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse. The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too. ALK Market Cap: $5.5B. ALK Loyalty Scheme Value: $12B (2024 investor day said so). Bungle the loyalty scheme, the easiest free money printer you can dream of, and everything goes with it. Watch how they show the world they have no control of it. The Q2 2025 Surprise: ALK suddenly booked a $180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere. No revenue match. Just $180M dropped from the sky. The Receivables Game: In the same quarter, their receivables from Bank of America (their credit card daddy) spiked $195M. Translation: Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no reason. If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand. No explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle: By Q3, $120M of that receivable vanished from \"Current Assets\" and wormed its way into \"Other Non-Current Assets.\" Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC won't check the storage locker. Spoiler: They will. # 4. The Unapprehended Traveler (The Kill Shot) This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs. And make the stock rock soon. Right now - literally today - there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskan's hard-earned miles. So hard-earned that our hero victim actually spotted it! He called up Alaska! *\"Hey! There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now!\"* The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk, right? Wait until CBP takes him out back... **NOPE.** It doesn't happen. The thief isn't brave; he's safe. **Because Alaska never tells anyone.** There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster *who was literally in the air*, and Alaska refused. Why? Because an arrest creates a Police Report. A Police Report creates a Public Record. A Public Record proves a Data Breach. A Breach crashes the Stock. They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up. How you think the Trumpisters gonna play this when they find out... # The Play The assets are unexplained ($180M apparition). The tech is broken (no 2FA). The governance is cowardly (hiding the breach).

You know what is out of fashion Competence . You know what is in fashion Organized crime syndicates stealing off Americans to give plane tickets to foreigners so they can fly into JFK in Business Class for $ 35 . And you know who is letting it happen Alaska Airlines they know all about it but refuses to tell anyone because they are terrified of their own stock chart . This isnt an airline . It is a distressed fintech with planes attached run by cowards who are actively helping criminals cross the border to save their quarterly bonus . I am Short Alaska Airlines . Here is the dirt . But if your smoothbrains dont want to read or think just jam this report into your AI and ask it if this is the ravings of a lunatic It will tell you to short at the double . 1 . The Penalty Box Infinite Loop Tech is Fcked In 2022 some poor guy had his mileage account drained so a random dude could travel in luxury . It was a lastminute ticket and the hackers changed the notification email so the victim never_knew until it was too late . ALK agreed to give his points back as a onetime courtesy but then punished the victim by permanently banning them from booking online . They have to call a phone line open 95 to use their own points forever . Fast forward 4 years to 2026 . They havent fixed a single line of code . It is the exact same robbery . Exact same response . Only now hackers are running a train on Alaska . Look at the scoreboard 370 confirmed hacks on public forums in 2025 . 370 Who cares you ask wiping Cheeto dust on your wifes boyfriends couch . Listen to me . More than half of those came from the absolute nerdiest end of milesniffers . 41 came from a niche Chineselanguage chat room US Card Forum with only 12000 weekly visitors . That is the tip of the iceberg . If 41 guys in a tiny Chinese forum got hit the real number across the 12 million normies who dont check their accounts daily is in the tens of thousands . An airline with tech so jacked they cant even stop randomers on the other side of the world from switching your email has no_place in the modern world . 2 . The This is America Factor Now Im not_a complete moron . I know how this works . Leaking 100000s of data points and letting your best customers get beaten up as scapegoats Ha this is America . Nobody_will care about that . Equifax leaked the whole country and the stock went up . But this is more than that . 3 . The Accounting Riddle Things gets worse . The filings around the loyalty program have got lumps all over them too . ALK Market Cap $ 5.5B . ALK Loyalty Scheme Value $ 12B 2024 investor day said so . Bungle the loyalty scheme the easiest free money printer you can dream of and everything goes with it . Watch how they show the world they have no_control of it . The Q2 2025 Surprise ALK suddenly booked a $ 180M spike in loyalty liabilities out of nowhere_No revenue match . Just $ 180M dropped from the sky . The Receivables Game In the same quarter their receivables from Bank of America their credit card daddy spiked $ 195M . Translation Did Alaska tried to bill BofA for points for no_reason . If they did it looks like BofA told them to pound sand . No_explanation so who can say The Real Puzzle By Q3 $ 120M of that receivable vanished from Current Assets and wormed its way into Other NonCurrent Assets . Looks like something is being put in the basement hoping the SEC wont check the storage locker . Spoiler They will . 4 . The Unapprehended Traveler The Kill Shot This is the part that should put someone in handcuffs . And make the stock rock soon . Right now literally today there is almost certainly a foreign national jetting in on some poor Alaskans hardearned miles . So hardearned that our hero victim actually spotted it He called up Alaska Hey There is a thief in seat 4A flying to Seattle right now The thief must be a daredevil to take that risk right Wait until CBP takes him out back ... NOPE . It doesnt happen . The thief isnt brave hes safe . Because Alaska never_tells anyone . There are cases where victims begged Alaska to call the police on a fraudster who was literally in the air and Alaska refused . Why Because an arrest creates a Police Report . A Police Report creates a Public Record . A Public Record proves a Data Breach . A Breach crashes the Stock . They are choosing to facilitate organized crime and border violations just to keep the share price propped up . How you think the Trumpisters gon na play this when they find out ... The Play The assets are unexplained $ 180M apparition . The tech is broken no 2FA . The governance is cowardly hiding the breach .

But they made a great comeback with the Gemini 3 and also TPUs being used for training it.

But they made a great comeback with the Gemini 3 and also TPUs being used for training it . Now the narrative is that Google is the best position company in the AI era .

      "selftext": "**USAR: 90% convinced, need a gut check before sizing up** Started a small position today at $16.58. Everything says this should be bigger. Talk me out of it. **What they do:** USA Rare Earth owns Round Top Mountain in Texas. Only major domestic deposit of heavy rare earths - dysprosium and terbium. These go into every F-35 (920 lbs per plane), EV motor, wind turbine, missile guidance system. China controls 99% of global heavy rare earth processing. **Why now:** * Trump talking about Greenland for rare earth deposits * China suspended export controls until November 2026. When they come back, this becomes critical infrastructure * Stillwater, Oklahoma magnet facility starts production Q1 2026 * Acquired Less Common Metals for $100M in November - only scaled rare earth metal producer outside China **Numbers:** * $5.56 to $43.98 in 2025, now $16-17. Down 60% from highs * $2.5B market cap. MP Materials is $10B with $400M DoD backing * Pre-revenue, burning $10-15M quarterly, $523M cash * All Buy ratings, average target $23 **Bull case:** * MP got $400M government equity. USAR CEO says \"in close communication with administration\" * Round Top is 70% heavy rare earths. MP is light rare earths. Different products, both needed * Stillwater revenue starts Q1 2026. First proof they can produce * China export restrictions return November 2026 **Bear case:** * Stillwater was supposed to produce in 2023, now 2026 * 211% dilution in 2025. More coming * MP already operational, profitable, government-backed * No confirmed government money yet **What I need:** Am I missing something on the bear case? Is dilution worse than I think? Wait for Stillwater confirmation? **Position:** 257 shares at $16.58. Considering 500-1000 more to hit 5-7% of portfolio.",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro, Interactive Brokers, Trading212, etc., with people reporting things like: - accounts being frozen or closed; - slow or unresponsive customer service; - difficulty withdrawing funds; - limited explanations during “reviews”. As a long-term retail investor, this honestly makes me uneasy. Many of us are investing years of savings, trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades. I’m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases, compliance issues, and I’d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors. Some genuine questions I have: What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account? How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked? Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice? - What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk? (multiple brokers, record-keeping, etc.) I’m not trying to bash any broker, just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages. Would love to hear: Personal experiences good or bad; Insights from people who’ve dealt with compliance reviews; Views from anyone with legal, regulatory, or professional investing background. Let’s keep it constructive, I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don’t always ask. Thanks in advance",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi everyone I ’ ve been reading a lot of posts on Reddit lately about platforms like eToro Interactive Brokers Trading212 etc . with people reporting things like accounts being frozen or closed slow or unresponsive customer service difficulty withdrawing funds limited explanations during “ reviews ” . As a longterm retail investor this honestly makes me uneasy . Many of us are investing years of savings trusting these platforms to hold our assets while we build wealth over decades . I ’ m trying to separate real systemic risk from isolated cases compliance issues and I ’ d really appreciate hearing from more experienced investors . Some genuine questions I have What actual legal protections do retail investors have if a broker freezes or closes an account How safe are client assets if a platform fails or is hacked Are shares truly segregated and recoverable in practice What practical steps do experienced investors take to reduce platform risk multiple brokers recordkeeping etc . I ’ m not_trying to bash any broker just trying to understand how this works in the real world beyond marketing pages . Would love to hear Personal experiences good or bad Insights from people who ’ ve dealt with compliance reviews Views from anyone with legal regulatory or professional investing background . Let ’ s keep it constructive I think this is something a lot of quiet investors worry about but don ’ t always ask . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "Anyone else make the right plays but sell too early? Are stuck to their phone and take gains before they should have? I just keep selling my calls before I should because I see my gains go down a slight amount. Maybe I should stay off my phone but I primarily do weeklies (cause I’m well regarded) and my most recent plays I could’ve 4-5x’d but instead I sold them for a 20-80% gain. For example, I bought AMD 6 205 calls at 4.15 on Friday and all the J Powell news came out I thought I was gonna be -50% on open. Open happens and I exit +300 dollars on a 2k gamble. Come today it hit 222 and the call is currently selling for 4x. And this is not even the first time this has happened. I have sold way too early on last week’s micron calls in which I could have also 4x’d. I had puts on the random day that Trump dropped the market with tariff news and sold for +200% when if I held I could’ve sold them for around +2000%. So just wondering, do I need to hold longer or am I just not made out for dailies/weeklies and should just do leaps. Anyone else in a similar situation or am I just the stupid one getting correct timings but incorrect exits? I have screenshots if anyone wants proof as well",

Maybe I should stay off my phone but I primarily do weeklies cause I ’ m well regarded and my most recent plays I could ’ ve 45x ’ d but instead I sold them for a 2080 % gain . For example I bought AMD 6 205 calls at 4.15 on Friday and all the J Powell news came out I thought I was gon na be 50 % on open . Open happens and I exit 300 dollars on a 2k gamble . Come today it hit 222 and the call is currently selling for 4x . And this is not_even the first time this has happened . I have sold way too early on last week ’ s micron calls in which I could have also 4x ’ d . I had puts on the random day that Trump dropped the market with tariff news and sold for 200 % when if I held I could ’ ve sold them for around 2000 % . So just wondering do I need to hold longer or am I just not_made out for dailiesweeklies and should just do leaps . Anyone else in a similar situation or am I just the stupid one getting correct timings but incorrect exits I have screenshots if anyone wants proof as well"

      "selftext": "Secretary of Defense, Hegseth’s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no brainer. The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies. It also assigns to combat units authority to buy, test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes, according to reports. \"While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape,\" Hegseth said in the video online. \"Not anymore.\" The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by \"approving hundreds of American products\" for military purchase. It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry. The DOD plans to arm combat units with a \"variety of low-cost drones\" made by American engineers and AI experts. The order will also expand the Blue List of DOD-approved unmanned drones, components and software, as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency, according to reports. The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS, which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use. \"Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops,\" the memo said. Lastly, the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year, which includes force-on-force drone wars. \"Lethality will not be hindered by self-imposed restrictions, especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue,\" Hegseth wrote in the memo. The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones part of the SRR contract, which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. Following news today, RedCat’s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat’s drones. They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago. In December alone, they delivered 641 systems/drones. And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1,800% YoY revenue. There is also speculation that RedCat’s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its anti-jamming technology. They are also tapping in the USV, which I’m sure you’ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones. Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia? Yup. RedCat. TLDR: Drone warfare is here. American drone dominance is here. Plan to outpace China which means $$$$$ for drone industry. RedCat won SRR contract beating 30+ competitors for it. Meeting the supply demand for the contract. Has connections to current administration. Approved for NATO. Tapped into USV industry. Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro. 1,800% YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long.",

      "selftext_processed": "Secretary of Defense Hegseth ’ s drone dominance orders are favoring drone stocks and is a clear no_brainer . The order removed prior DOD policies from 2021 and 2022 that restricted the U.S. military from buying drones and components made by Chinese companies . It also assigns to combat units authority to buy test and train with small UAS drones that comply with statutes according to reports . While our adversaries have produced millions of cheap drones before us we were mired in bureaucratic red tape Hegseth said in the video online . Not anymore . The memo aims to bolster U.S. drone manufacturing by approving hundreds of American products for military purchase . It also calls to leverage private capital that supports the industry . The DOD plans to arm combat units with a variety of lowcost drones made by American engineers and AI experts . The order will also expand the Blue List of DODapproved unmanned drones components and software as part of a collaboration between the Defense Innovation Unit and the Defense Contract Management Agency according to reports . The DOD in 2020 established an effort called Blue UAS which is the process for certifying commercial drones for military use . Modern battlefield innovation demands a new procurement strategy that fuses manufacturers with our front line troops the memo said . Lastly the DOD plans to integrate drones into relevant combat training starting next year which includes forceonforce drone wars . Lethality will not_be hindered by selfimposed restrictions especially when it comes to harnessing technologies we invented but were slow to pursue Hegseth wrote in the memo . The announcement builds on a June 6 executive order from the White House to invest in drone technology and integrate it into the national airspace . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones part of the SRR contract which the budget has increased from 70M to 800M . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . Following news today RedCat ’ s Black Widow just got approved for the NATO NSPA Catalogue signaling NATO countries likely to purchase RedCat ’ s drones . They recently did an offering for 170M that got gobbled up by tutes and they exercised underwritten options a few months ago . In December alone they delivered 641 systemsdrones . And further announced Q4 preliminary guidance of 25M resulting in over 1800 % YoY revenue . There is also speculation that RedCat ’ s Black Widow involving its visual navigation thanks to Palantir strategic partnership was used to help capture Maduro with its antijamming technology . They are also tapping in the USV which I ’ m sure you ’ ve heard about as many russian vessels were taken down by these sea drones . Guess which compared acquired that exact product known as the Magura7 and started production in its brand new facility in Georgia Yup . RedCat . TLDR Drone warfare is here . American drone dominance is here . Plan to outpace China which means $ $ $ $ $ for drone industry . RedCat won SRR contract beating 30 competitors for it . Meeting the supply demand for the contract . Has connections to current administration . Approved for NATO . Tapped into USV industry . Speculating to be used for the capture of Maduro . 1800 % YoY increase in revenue I am 15k shares long ."

      "selftext": "Everyone loves posting that chart and saying “just buy stocks and chill.” Cool story. It worked… in the past. \\[See image originally published in [ \\] But the world is quite different now - may more investors (educated or uneducated), many more interests, many more opportunities, different ways to get returns (think about e-Commerce, investing in fractional shares of Real Estate, etc). And, especially, I feel there are more companies getting listed now, and back then only the solid one would make it. Not that it prevented them from falling or failing, but at least there was more structure to that. So… I'm not implying that “**stocks are dead**” as I'm quite invested in that. Just wondering if we’re confusing a great historical run with a permanent law of nature. * Are stocks **still** “the best” because they’re inherently superior, or because the system is now designed to keep them afloat? * Do future returns look anything like the past? * Or are we just anchoring to a history that will not repeat so similarly? * Where does Crypto sit in this equation? And especially: * What other asset, if not stocks, would you see as a winner - or at least as a close competitor to Stocks?",

About 50% of my portfolio is in blue chip stocks, but I also like to experiment with growth stocks, tech stocks, and even some small-cap stocks (I know it’s quite aggressive for me, but I keep it within what I’m comfortable with). I’m looking for like minded friends to chat with and perhaps exchange some investment strategies and stocks we’re bullish on. And if we happen to be in the same city, grabbing a drink together would be a great option too!",

      "selftext": "Hi, I recently got a new job and will be transferring my old 401k into an IRA in Fidelity to reduce management fees. Based on some quick research, here is roughly what I’m thinking but would love to hear feedback / advice. Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no or little management fees: 50% FZROX (basically VOO but no fees?) 20% FZILX (international emerging markets with no fees) 20% FTEC (fidelity tech etf) 10% FESM (fidelity small cap) What are your thoughts on this? And since I will start with all cash, do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period? It’s roughly 70k USD. Thank you in advance",

Based on some quick research here is roughly what I ’ m thinking but would love to hear feedback advice . Mainly looking at fidelity ETFs that seem to have no_or little management fees 50 % FZROX basically VOO but no_fees 20 % FZILX international emerging markets with no_fees 20 % FTEC fidelity tech etf 10 % FESM fidelity small cap What are your thoughts on this And since I will start with all cash do I dump it in all at once or should I space out my buys over something like a 6 month period It ’ s roughly 70k USD . Thank you in advance"

      "selftext": "Hello, Investors: I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soon-to-be-born daughter's college fund, and \"retirement\" funds for my wife and me. All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers (no options, futures, forex or crypto), which has been very successful for me. But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market (income), and not a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth (savings). My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 (for college fund) to 30 (for \"retirement\" fund) years. I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets, and long-term family planning. Currently I am torn between VT and VTI. Do you have any opinion on either ETF? Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with, and any experience you have had with a similar plan. Also, please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here. I don't want to fall into a trap just because I don't know what I don't know. NOTE: I am not seeking any *advice*. I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning. Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello Investors I am going to set up a brokerage account this year to house saved funds for my soontobeborn daughters college fund and retirement funds for my wife and me . All of my experience with the stock market is in swing trading individual tickers no options futures forex or crypto which has been very successful for me . But I see swing trading as a way to pull funds out of the market income and not_a a smart way to store wealth for long term growth savings . My plan is to pick one broad spectrum ETF and to DCA into that one ticker for the next 18 for college fund to 30 for retirement fund years . I personally think it is a waste of money for us to use a financial planner since I have educated myself on the markets and longterm family planning . Currently I am torn between VT and VTI . Do you have any opinion on either ETF Please share your opinions on which ETFs you have experience with and any experience you have had with a similar plan . Also please let me know if it looks like I am missing something here . I dont want to fall into a trap just because I dont know what I dont know . NOTE I am not_seeking any advice . I am merely curious as to your experiences and opinions so that I can use that information as another data point in my research and planning . Thank you for your time and I hope you have a great day ."

      "selftext": "$UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV (Autonomous Vehicle) fears. It’s currently trading at a Forward P/E of x25. The market is pricing $UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy. I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year, where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly, fears of search AI taking over Google search. In a similar fashion, I believe AV is not here as Uber’s competition, rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV’s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact. Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo, and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together. Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US, with 1 city partnering with Lyft, 2 with Uber, and the remaining 2 with themselves, constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution, market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out. If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it, the upside story looks quite convincing. This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not end up being a winner take all market, rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player. But with the TAM for AVs being so large, and the payback period for AVs being so high currently, it’ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does. I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement, hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 30-35P/E as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets. Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out, and Uber is left in the dust with no partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out, so will their gross bookings. However, I’m not particularly worried. They’ve partnered with Nvidia, they’ve partnered with Avride, Costco, even Sephora. Feels like something will stick. [Position: 4 LEAPS, waiting for multiples expansion to take profit]( Yes I know their current P/E of \\~10 is fake due to tax reasons. TLDR: Buy Uber, AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor.",

      "selftext_processed": "$ UBER is currently pretty beaten down due to AV Autonomous Vehicle fears . It ’ s currently trading at a Forward PE of x25 . The market is pricing $ UBER in a way that deems AVs as its competition rather than synergy . I believe these fears are overblown and this play will end up being similar to Google around mid last year where Google stock price was suppressed by both the Antitrust Monopoly lawsuit against them and more importantly fears of search AI taking over Google search . In a similar fashion I believe AV is not_here as Uber ’ s competition rather Uber has the user base and market penetration to leverage themselves as a distributor for AV ’ s whilst keeping their asset light business structure intact . Currently the main AV player to look out for is Waymo and perhaps Tesla if Elon gets his act together . Waymo currently operates in 5 cities in the US with 1 city partnering with Lyft 2 with Uber and the remaining 2 with themselves constituting a testing phase to see what works in terms of distribution market penetration and how to optimally roll AVs out . If you can see Uber as collaborating with AV in the future and being the primary distribution platform rather than competing against it the upside story looks quite convincing . This story is further compounded if you believe that AVs will not_end up being a winner take all market rather a fragmented market where Uber will remain as a major player . But with the TAM for AVs being so large and the payback period for AVs being so high currently it ’ ll take ages for it to become a winner takes all market if it even does . I think the market is being way too scared of Uber right now and eventually the narrative will shift when we realise mass AV adoption will still take a couple of years to implement hopefully leading to a multiples expansion to 3035PE as a reasonable tech growth stock in the current markets . Obviously the risk in this thesis is that the AV story plays out and Uber is left in the dust with no_partners and as the traditional fleet of drivers ages out so will their gross bookings . However I ’ m not_particularly worried . They ’ ve partnered with Nvidia they ’ ve partnered with Avride Costco even Sephora . Feels like something will stick . Position 4 LEAPS waiting for multiples expansion to take profit Yes I know their current PE of 10 is fake due to tax reasons . TLDR Buy Uber AV fears are overblown and Uber will come out as a winner as a distributor rather than a direct AV competitor ."

      "selftext": "I know the title sounds kind of crazy, but hear me out. Over the past year or so, companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP-1 is the \"#1 savor\" for weight lost. Now, I'm not against the drug and I believe that it is very useful. The process of losing weight is different for everyone, and this drug is great in that sense. However......like with all good things, people find a way to abuse them! There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions. Even on social media (TikTok and others), there are doctors, practicing and non practicing, that are actively/heavily *promoting* some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability. Idc about the logistics of it all, I'm just telling you what I see on my social media feeds. In some weird way, I'm getting opioid crisis/Purdue Pharma/Sackler Family vibes. **No**, there are **no direct parallels** necessarily, but things just seem off about this. I think it's probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse. Also, as we all know with medicine, it usually takes years to hear about major side effects, which is normal. On top of that, I'm sure there are people using it in *creative* ways. Basically, I'm betting for even more significant side effects, lack of adherence and misuse/abuse. This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the stores/pharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make....you know what. But before that, I'm sure sudafed was a free-for-all type of situation. Now on to the investing part...I'm not too sure how to do this. Doing some quick research, and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago. I think it's called shorted/shorting? The only difference is that I don't have billions, so I won't lose billions..haha. I'm thinking of it as something on the side, small amounts of money over a period of time. But I think the same principle still applies, right? Obviously, this isn't a short term thing. But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually, and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way. What are your opinions? How should I start? Overall, do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this? Idk...humans always find a way to abuse things, so i don't feel too crazy for this idea.",

Over the past year or so companies have been using TV and radio to heavily market to the public that GLP1 is the 1 savor for weight lost . Now Im not_against the drug and I believe that it is very useful . The process of losing weight is different for everyone and this drug is great in that sense . However ...... like with all good things people find a way to abuse them There are SO many smaller companies selling compounds of this drug and people are able to get them without prescriptions . Even on social media TikTok and others there are doctors practicing and non practicing that are activelyheavily promoting some of these compounds and most likely getting some sort of kickback without the liability . Idc about the logistics of it all Im just telling you what I see on my social media feeds . In some weird way Im getting opioid crisisPurdue PharmaSackler Family vibes . No there are no direct parallels necessarily but things just seem off about this . I think its probably the easy accessibility and the opportunity for abuse . Also as we all know with medicine it usually takes years to hear about major side effects which is normal . On top of that Im sure there are people using it in creative ways . Basically Im betting for even more significant side effects lack of adherence and misuseabuse . This also reminds me of when I learned that Sudafed was limited in the storespharmacies in the early 2000s because it could be used to make .... you know what . But before that Im sure sudafed was a freeforall type of situation . Now on to the investing part ... Im not_too sure how to do this . Doing some quick research and I was thinking of doing what those hedge funds did to Gamestop a few years ago . I think its called shortedshorting The only difference is that I dont have billions so I wont lose billions .. haha . Im thinking of it as something on the side small amounts of money over a period of time . But I think the same principle still applies right Obviously this isnt a short term thing . But I expect companies to take a major hit eventually and then the government will put some regulation in place in some sort of way . What are your opinions How should I start Overall do you all think i crazy for betting for something like this Idk ... humans always find a way to abuse things so i dont feel too crazy for this idea ."

      "selftext": "Right now my 401k is 100% in a 2065 target date fund. The mix is about 90% stocks and 10% bonds. i’m in my early 20s so I know based on my age I should lean towards higher risk which means basically no bonds. My roth ira and personal brokerage is all heavily invested in s&p 500 already. So I was planning on switching my 401k to 100% in s&p 500 but I checked today and was surprised that for 2025, my target date fund actually outperformed s&p 500. This made me consider keeping it in a target date fund although I know I really shouldn’t let one year determine my investment plan. But since I already invest heavily in S&P in my other accounts, would it actually be smart to keep my 401k in a target date fund? Edit: Thanks for the advice. I decided to change to a 70% S&P 500 and 30% international in my 401k. But have a follow up question about whether i should do automatic rebalancing in 401k and how frequent it should happen. Here’s the follow up post",

      "selftext_processed": "Right now my 401k is 100 % in a 2065 target date fund . The mix is about 90 % stocks and 10 % bonds . i ’ m in my early 20s so I know based on my age I should lean towards higher risk which means basically no_bonds . My roth ira and personal brokerage is all heavily invested in sp 500 already . So I was planning on switching my 401k to 100 % in sp 500 but I checked today and was surprised that for 2025 my target date fund actually outperformed sp 500 . This made me consider keeping it in a target date fund although I know I really shouldn ’ t let one year determine my investment plan . But since I already invest heavily in SP in my other accounts would it actually be smart to keep my 401k in a target date fund Edit Thanks for the advice . I decided to change to a 70 % SP 500 and 30 % international in my 401k . But have a follow up question about whether i should do automatic rebalancing in 401k and how frequent it should happen . Here ’ s the follow up post"

      "selftext": "I moved my 50kish (between Roth and Rollover IRA) from my old employers retirement plan over to Schwab savings account \\[\\[\\[EDIT - I've since moved them over to Fidelity but transfer not completed yet\\]\\]. I chose not to go into investments at the time because of life stuff and economy concerns so I parked it to address later, which is now. I've gotten some reach outs from Schwab people trying to get me to do certain actions with the money but I can't help but feel crazy skeptical about them and their motivations. I don't trust them. I also still have 15k in another previous employers 401k plan at Fidelity that's still with them. It's 51% domestic stock, 38% foreign stock, 10% bonds (roughly). From the portal I have an annualized return of 18.96% with Index of 22.98%. So it's actually 18k+ right now, not 15 as I thought it was last time I checked. I also have a bunch of Ethereum (I already withdrew my initial investment) and it's valued anywhere between 150,000-200,000 based on the numbers of the past month. I'm not banking on it, it's just an extra atm. What should I do with this? I have no kids, single at 37, very little debt (just vehicle) but I'm unemployed by choice but should be able to earn 100k\\~ salary when I get back to work after caretaking for my parents for the past two years of unemployment. I have about 30k+ in savings. I want to be able to live financially independent of any partner. Any and every advice would be appreciated. Thank you. Edit: I do not own my home, I'm back living with parents as I figure out their end of life situation. I expect to get back in the workforce and either purchase a home in the next year or otherwise just move out on my own again after the fact. I'm not counting on any inheritance. Though if I'm able to square my parents a way where they're safe and secure through the rest of their lives, they may be able to help me cosign for a mortgage to help me get a leg up there. Additional Edit: I've now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess 'lets goooo'. I dunno. Just tryin to survive here while having a good time",

Additional Edit Ive now moved them over to Fidelity where I actually already have my last account of 15k so I guess lets goooo . I dunno . Just tryin to survive here while having a good time"

      "selftext": "As I've posted before here, I'm neck deep into RKT shares, from my one and ONLY YOLO from 5+ yrs ago, starting with WAMPQ ->WMIH -> COOP -> RKT last year. I also started getting into Options (both buying AND selling them) last year, after learning from you all (and other Reddit forums), to generate income against those shares (because I don't want to/can't practically sell them all at once). I was (and in some way, still am) a novice when it comes to Options, and needed to learn about DTEs, Delta/Theta etc, by trial and ERROR. I also needed to understand TAX implications of suddenly coming into so much $$$ all at once. On Taxes: Did you know that there's something called a \"Millionaire Tax\" surcharge in MA? And that there's a 4% NIIT (Net Investment Income) Tax at the Federal Level at $200k (single)/$300k or more in \"investment\" income? I also had to LEARN (the HARD way) \\*when\\* to sell Covered Calls & PUTS, when NOT to, when to take Profits early on CCs and PUTS, when you need to just BTC (Buy To Close) a losing Options Trade. For example, today's losses came from getting \"caught\" in an overnight 10% run-up in RKT last week, after Trump tweeted TWICE about Housing, where I should have closed the CCs after the 1st Tweet (and then dropped the $200B MBS bombshell afterhours). I knew RKT would get to this range, but I assumed it would get to today's level after Feb/Earnings. Then the tweets happened..... Half of today's \"Loss\" is from Rolling a couple of CC's up/out, so the loss wasn't that bad comparatively to what it was looking like it might be over the weekend (like 2-3x WORSE, before the Powell news tanked things a bit this morning). Most of RKT's potential is already priced in given the run-up, for now, but I do expect it to be into the high $20's next year, which is still a very nice gain if you bought it in the $10's range, last year.

      "selftext": "I've been reading a bunch of posts here and in r/Bogleheads on equal weight ETFs. One thing constantly mentioned is that they are less tax efficient due to the extra need for rebalancing vs a weighted ETF. I think I'm missing something because my lizard brain tells me that there should inherently be less rebalancing that needs to be done with equal weight since a holding only needs to adjusted if it is removed from the underlying index (in this case S&P 100). Whereas a weighted ETF would also need to remove this same holding entirely if it's removed from the index, plus it also needs to adjust weights periodically to match market caps even when a holding isn't removed from the underlying index. What am I missing?",

Only accounts for November at best . Were in a K shaped economy the poor get poorer and the rich get Aritzia Edit To everyone thats asking Yes Im still holding . Zara is valued at like 150bil USD and Aritizia is only sitting at 11bil USD . Theres more than enough room for this to grow 510x in the next couple years ."

      "selftext": "Source - [ Growing public backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is creating a new category of investment risk that goes beyond traditional ESG concerns. Companies with ICE exposure are now facing what analysts are calling a \"volatility factor\" - where reputational damage, employee dissent, and local legal resistance can materially impact valuations regardless of federal funding levels. Private prison operators GEO Group (GEO) and CoreCivic (CXW) carry the highest concentration risk, with GEO deriving roughly 40%+ of revenue from ICE-related operations. Despite benefiting from post-election enforcement expansion, both stocks have turned volatile as legal resistance intensifies in states like California and New Jersey, and municipalities increasingly use zoning laws to block new detention facilities. Big tech names including Palantir (PLTR) and Amazon (AMZN) face a different threat: internal resistance. Palantir has weathered repeated employee protests over its immigration software contracts, while Amazon's AWS infrastructure supporting DHS operations makes it a frequent target for boycott campaigns despite the revenue being financially immaterial. Perhaps most surprising is the hospitality sector's exposure. Marriott (MAR) and Hilton (HLT) face what the report calls \"brand contagion risk\" - where franchise-level decisions can quickly escalate into nationwide boycotts. Hilton is currently navigating pressure from both sides after a Minnesota Hampton Inn refused service to ICE personnel, triggering political backlash while still remaining exposed to activist scrutiny elsewhere. This feels like a new paradigm where federal contracts don't automatically mean safe revenue anymore.",

      "selftext": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views. No idea why. Wasn't selling anything, wasn't pumping tickers, just sharing my thinking. Whatever. Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently that's a problem. **What I think is happening:** * Trump needs the market to rip into midterms. That's it. That's the whole thing. Everything else flows from there. * Tax cuts, deregulation, defense spending, rate cuts, cash handouts to the base. He needs wins he can point to, and stock market go up is the easiest win there is. * Meanwhile nobody wants to test him right now. Maduro got snatched. That sent a message. Iran's not going to do anything crazy. Putin's going to wait and see. China's playing nice for the moment. * That buys a window where risk assets can run. **Then last night happened:** * DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell. The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed. The actual reason, according to Powell himself, is that Trump wants lower rates. * Powell posted a video Sunday night. Direct quote: \"The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president.\" * He said that. On camera. The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates. * Gold hit record highs overnight. Dollar sold off. Futures dumped. \"Sell America\" trade came back. * But by midday stocks had mostly recovered. Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs. Selloff, panic, stabilization, back to business. **What this means:** * Short term: volatility. Markets don't like Fed independence being threatened. Chop ahead. * Medium term: probably bullish? If Trump gets his rate cuts, whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May, that's rocket fuel for stocks. Bad for the dollar, bad for inflation eventually, but good for equities through 2026. * Long term: this is where it splits into two very different futures. **Path one, the pump:** * Trump gets what he wants. Rates come down. Housing unfreezes. Consumer spending picks up. * Defense budget passes. $1.5T proposed. Counter-drone, AI infrastructure, domestic manufacturing all eat. * Deregulation everywhere. Crypto rips. Tech rips. Everything rips. * Market pumps into midterms. People with risk assets do well. **Path two, the collapse:** * Trump doesn't stop at pressuring the Fed. He breaks it. Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions. * \"Sell America\" stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend. Bonds, dollar, and stocks all falling together. * Or he goes further. Starts taking territory, seizing assets from other countries, because the spending isn't sustainable otherwise. World wants to respond but can't, at first, because US military dominance. * Internal resistance builds. Coup, paralysis, who knows. Or we stumble into a real conflict. China moves on Taiwan. Russia escalates. Iran miscalculates. * Everything falls apart. **Here's the thing though:** * Even in path two, some stuff still works. Defense doesn't go down during wars. AI infrastructure still matters. Critical minerals become more critical, not less. * Unless it goes nuclear. Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios. **Signals I'm watching:** * Fed independence. If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early, major red flag. Multiple \"Sell America\" days in a row means it's real. * Defense budget. $1.5T passes, defense names keep working. Stalls or gets blocked, time to reassess. * Supreme Court on Lisa Cook. Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors. He wins, Fed independence is done. * Credit card cap. Trump floated 10% today. Banks cratered. If this happens, he's willing to break things for short term juice. * Foreign treasury holders. China and Japan start dumping in size, that's the real signal. * Gold. Already at records. Keeps ripping while stocks chop, smart money is positioning for something. **When I get out:** * Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days, not hours * Defense budgets stall * Bonds, dollar, stocks all falling together for a week plus * Actual military conflict, not just talk **Where I'm positioned:** * Themes: defense, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, domestic semis, some housing * Mix of shares and longer dated options * Stuff that wins if Trump pumps, but doesn't completely die if things get ugly **Bottom line:** * Bull case: market pumps into midterms, I take profits in 2026 * Bear case: system breaks, but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies * Worst case: nukes, and nobody cares about stonks anymore I'm comfortable with those odds.",

      "selftext_processed": "Mods took down my last post after 200k views . No_idea why . Wasnt selling anything wasnt pumping tickers just sharing my thinking . Whatever . Trying again with more focus on the macro and less on specific positions since apparently thats a problem . What I think is happening Trump needs the market to rip into midterms . Thats it . Thats the whole thing . Everything else flows from there . Tax cuts deregulation defense spending rate cuts cash handouts to the base . He needs wins he can point to and stock market go up is the easiest win there is . Meanwhile nobody_wants to test him right now . Maduro got snatched . That sent a message . Irans not_going to do anything crazy . Putins going to wait and see . Chinas playing nice for the moment . That buys a window where risk assets can run . Then last night happened DOJ opened a criminal investigation into Jerome Powell . The stated reason is testimony about some building renovation at the Fed . The actual reason according to Powell himself is that Trump wants lower rates . Powell posted a video Sunday night . Direct quote The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public rather than following the preferences of the president . He said that . On camera . The Fed Chair publicly accused the President of using the DOJ to intimidate him into cutting rates . Gold hit record highs overnight . Dollar sold off . Futures dumped . Sell America trade came back . But by midday stocks had mostly recovered . Same pattern as Liberation Day tariffs . Selloff panic stabilization back to business . What this means Short term volatility . Markets dont like Fed independence being threatened . Chop ahead . Medium term probably bullish If Trump gets his rate cuts whether by breaking Powell or replacing him in May thats rocket fuel for stocks . Bad for the dollar bad for inflation eventually but good for equities through 2026 . Long term this is where it splits into two very different futures . Path one the pump Trump gets what he wants . Rates come down . Housing unfreezes . Consumer spending picks up . Defense budget passes . $ 1.5T proposed . Counterdrone AI infrastructure domestic manufacturing all eat . Deregulation everywhere . Crypto rips . Tech rips . Everything rips . Market pumps into midterms . People with risk assets do well . Path two the collapse Trump doesnt stop at pressuring the Fed . He breaks it . Foreign investors lose faith in US institutions . Sell America stops being a one day trade and becomes a trend . Bonds dollar and stocks all falling together . Or he goes further . Starts taking territory seizing assets from other countries because the spending isnt sustainable otherwise . World wants to respond but cant at first because US military dominance . Internal resistance builds . Coup paralysis who knows . Or we stumble into a real conflict . China moves on Taiwan . Russia escalates . Iran miscalculates . Everything falls apart . Heres the thing though Even in path two some stuff still works . Defense doesnt go down during wars . AI infrastructure still matters . Critical minerals become more critical not_less . Unless it goes nuclear . Then none of this matters and we all have bigger problems than our portfolios . Signals Im watching Fed independence . If Powell gets indicted or pushed out early major red flag . Multiple Sell America days in a row means its real . Defense budget . $ 1.5T passes defense names keep working . Stalls or gets blocked time to reassess . Supreme Court on Lisa Cook . Arguments this month on whether Trump can fire Fed governors . He wins Fed independence is done . Credit card cap . Trump floated 10 % today . Banks cratered . If this happens hes willing to break things for short term juice . Foreign treasury holders . China and Japan start dumping in size thats the real signal . Gold . Already at records . Keeps ripping while stocks chop smart money is positioning for something . When I get out Fed independence breaks and market prices it in over days not_hours Defense budgets stall Bonds dollar stocks all falling together for a week plus Actual military conflict not_just talk Where Im positioned Themes defense AI infrastructure critical minerals domestic semis some housing Mix of shares and longer dated options Stuff that wins if Trump pumps but doesnt completely die if things get ugly Bottom line Bull case market pumps into midterms I take profits in 2026 Bear case system breaks but defense and infrastructure still work because wars need supplies Worst case nukes and nobody_cares about stonks anymore Im comfortable with those odds ."

      "selftext": "Hello all, I was hoping you could help me figure out how to rebalance my portfolio. I'm ~40yo, make around $180/yr in a HCOL area. I'm currently very aggressive in total market index fund allocation. It's my belief that there will be a shift away from the US in the coming years to decades. Whether due to normal economics, political turmoil, dedollarization, end of reserve currency status, purposeful defaulting on national debt to undermine markets. To me it seems like somebody in my position should be better positioned so that the potential losses are hedged in some manner. Here's a brief summary of my accounts. some of the data is obfuscated but you can get the point. Accounts are over multiple lines and all of the rows of that similar name are the accounts holdings. | Account Name | Symbol | Description | Quantity | Current Value (rounded) | Percent Of Account | |---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:| | Main Brokerage | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$32,800 | 9.19% | | Main Brokerage | VTI | VANGUARD INDEX FDS VANGUARD TOTAL STK MKT ETF | 601.722 | ~$203,900 | 57.11% | | Main Brokerage | VXUS | VANGUARD TOTAL INTERNATIONAL STOCK INDEX FUND | 129.317 | ~$10,000 | 2.80% | | Main Brokerage | BND | VANGUARD BD INDEX FDS TOTAL BND MRKT | 166.292 | ~$12,300 | 3.46% | | Main Brokerage | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 518.761 | ~$98,000 | 27.44% | | Rollover IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Rollover IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 2311.105 | ~$436,400 | 100.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | CORE\\*\\* | FDIC-INSURED DEPOSIT SWEEP | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | Post-Tax ROTH IRA | FSKAX | FIDELITY TOTAL MARKET INDEX FUND | 520 | ~$98,200 | 100.00% | | IRA MOM | SPAXX\\*\\* | HELD IN MONEY MARKET | | ~$0 | 0.00% | | IRA MOM | FPIFX | FIDELITY FREEDOM INDEX 2020 INVESTOR | 926.689 | ~$15,800 | 59.71% | | IRA MOM | FFFAX | FIDELITY FREEDOM RETIREMENT FUND | 937.059 | ~$10,600 | 40.29% | | 401K | FXAIX | FID 500 INDEX | 690.839 | ~$165,600 | 100.00% | | HYSA | | | | ~$100,000 | 100.00% | I was thinking that in tax advantaged accounts it would be good to move to VXUS or FTIHX. Both total international funds. My goal is to have international exposure. But I also don't want to lose out on growth. Maybe in the Roth IRA have a fund that is more aggressive like Contrafund or Blue chip or tech select. any advice would be great and appreciated. I just don't want to make a mistake and you I know are smarter than I. Thank you",

      "title": "Five Cheap AI Stocks To Watch When The Sector Rotates",
      "selftext": "When AI heats up, low-priced names often move first because traders pile into what is liquid and headline-sensitive. This is the short list I watch under $6. My 5 AI tickers to watch: **- BBAI** **- REKR** **- RIME** **- NOTE** **- GCT** Why I keep them: RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real run-rate metrics. The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M during 2025 and cited $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike. NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play \"AI SaaS\" sentiment without needing it to be in logistics. When software and AI sentiment improves, names like this can move on category flows. REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play. It is not pure freight optimization, but it is connected to the same idea: AI applied to real-world mobility systems, which can catch a sector bid. Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI, or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates? Do your own homework.",

My 5 AI tickers to watch BBAI REKR RIME NOTE GCT Why I keep them RIME stays on because it has a specific applied AI angle in freight logistics and has disclosed real runrate metrics . The company reported SemiCab ARR up 220 % from $ 2.5M to over $ 8M during 2025 and cited $ 15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts and expansions source type company press release . That is the kind of disclosure that can keep attention after the first spike . NOTE stays on because it is a simple way to play AI SaaS sentiment without needing it to be in logistics . When software and AI sentiment improves names like this can move on category flows . REKR stays on because it is a transportation AI play . It is not_pure freight optimization but it is connected to the same idea AI applied to realworld mobility systems which can catch a sector bid . Do you think the best rotation trades come from broad AI baskets like NOTE and BBAI or from niche applied AI stories like RIME that can drop contract and ARR updates Do your own homework ."

      "selftext": "The past few weeks we have seen how Trump has gone further and further into authorianism, removing all shackles of oversight & limits to his power. So far the market hasn't cared, not for inciting civil war, not for invading other countries, not for wanting to abolish NATO and now for prosecuting Powell simply because he does not do anything he is asked to. Now my question is: if markets don't care nor react to this either, will that not just prove to Trump that he is right and he can go even further? A (massive) correction right now would prove that the chosen path isn't accepted, but right now the market is cheering for it. What do you guys think?",

      "selftext": "I’m 20 from Australia, qualified in a physically demanding trade. I work early mornings, long days. I earn around $1,800 a week after tax including overtime, and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $47 to $55 an hour. I’m posting this because I want honest feedback, not validation. Where am I being naive? Where am I overthinking it? Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me? My general philosophy with money is this: build slowly, test myself honestly, and earn the right to press harder later. I’m playing the long game, but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it. I’m ambitious and not satisfied with “average good outcomes”. I want more, but not recklessly. I’m very aware that consistency beats intensity, and that most people fail because they scale too early, not too late. So this is how I currently run things. I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI, based on about 90% of my income so there’s always buffer. Weekly it looks like this: $400 for core living expenses, $160 for lifestyle, $300 towards a house deposit, $100 for travel or bigger purchases, and $600 into investing. Total is $1,560 a week. Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading. Every category has its own savings account. All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday. No rolling balances, no bullshit. Lifestyle is intentionally tight. Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate, but I work a physical job and I’m not exactly living it up mid-week anyway. I’ve built in room for excess because I know this isn’t sustainable forever. When income grows and life changes, I plan to let myself breathe more. I also keep an $8k emergency fund that I don’t touch, and I’ve got about $7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I’m no longer adding to. For investing, I put $600 a week into US ETFs. Roughly 40% into VGT, 40% into VTI, and 20% into VXUS. This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone. I don’t touch it emotionally. No tinkering, no panic moves, no chasing whatever’s hot this month. Alongside that, I run a small swing trading account, about $2k. This is not income to me. It’s training. I treat trading as skill development, pattern recognition, and learning capital preservation before there’s ever any talk of real leverage. I trade end-of-day swings since I’m in Australia trading US markets. I focus on sector strength, tight consolidations, breakouts and pullbacks, defined risk, and high ADR stocks. Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency. If I ever scale it, the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs, not lifestyle or savings. I’m not relying on trading to save me. I’m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it. Medium term, the next 3–5 years, the goals are straightforward. Keep building a house deposit, buy a property when it actually makes sense, keep ETF compounding going, stay disciplined with trading, and increase income through higher paying roles, specialisation, or side businesses. I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don’t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever. I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn’t care. Fatigue, boredom, temptation, and bad decisions are real. So I’ll ask again, honestly: where am I getting this wrong? Where am I playing it too safe? If you were 20, working a physical job, and thinking long term, what would you change? Am I underutilising my income, or am I actually protecting my future properly? Give me your worst. You old bastards.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m 20 from Australia qualified in a physically demanding trade . I work early mornings long days . I earn around $ 1800 a week after tax including overtime and in the next few weeks my hourly rate goes from $ 47 to $ 55 an hour . I ’ m posting this because I want honest feedback not_validation . Where am I being naive Where am I overthinking it Where would you push harder or pull back if you were me My general philosophy with money is this build slowly test myself honestly and earn the right to press harder later . I ’ m playing the long game but I want leverage if I actually prove worthy of it . I ’ m ambitious and not_satisfied with “ average good outcomes ” . I want more but not_recklessly . I ’ m very aware that consistency beats intensity and that most people fail because they scale too early not_too late . So this is how I currently run things . I operate off a fixed weekly allocation system I built with the help of AI based on about 90 % of my income so there ’ s always buffer . Weekly it looks like this $ 400 for core living expenses $ 160 for lifestyle $ 300 towards a house deposit $ 100 for travel or bigger purchases and $ 600 into investing . Total is $ 1560 a week . Anything extra covers weekly variance or goes into trading . Every category has its own savings account . All spending goes on a credit card for points and gets paid off in full every Sunday . No_rolling balances no_bullshit . Lifestyle is intentionally tight . Probably tighter than most people my age would tolerate but I work a physical job and I ’ m not_exactly living it up midweek anyway . I ’ ve built in room for excess because I know this isn ’ t sustainable forever . When income grows and life changes I plan to let myself breathe more . I also keep an $ 8k emergency fund that I don ’ t touch and I ’ ve got about $ 7k sitting in VONG from earlier on which I ’ m no_longer adding to . For investing I put $ 600 a week into US ETFs . Roughly 40 % into VGT 40 % into VTI and 20 % into VXUS . This is meant to compound quietly in the background and act as a financial backbone . I don ’ t touch it emotionally . No_tinkering no_panic moves no_chasing whatever ’ s hot this month . Alongside that I run a small swing trading account about $ 2k . This is not_income to me . It ’ s training . I treat trading as skill development pattern recognition and learning capital preservation before there ’ s ever any talk of real leverage . I trade endofday swings since I ’ m in Australia trading US markets . I focus on sector strength tight consolidations breakouts and pullbacks defined risk and high ADR stocks . Capital only increases after demonstrated consistency . If I ever scale it the money would come from slowly reallocating ETFs not_lifestyle or savings . I ’ m not_relying on trading to save me . I ’ m practicing so it could become leverage later if I earn it . Medium term the next 3–5 years the goals are straightforward . Keep building a house deposit buy a property when it actually makes sense keep ETF compounding going stay disciplined with trading and increase income through higher paying roles specialisation or side businesses . I already proportionally feel the physical tax of my job I don ’ t want my income ceiling to rely on my body forever . I know plans look clean on paper and real life doesn ’ t care . Fatigue boredom temptation and bad decisions are real . So I ’ ll ask again honestly where am I getting this wrong Where am I playing it too safe If you were 20 working a physical job and thinking long term what would you change Am I underutilising my income or am I actually protecting my future properly Give me your worst . You old bastards ."

      "selftext": "**I don't know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to re-post anyway.** Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here. I think Figma is no longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $20B. It’s definitely grown bigger (in terms of ARR + suite of AI offerings) and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI. What O365 is for productivity, Figma is for creativity. By creativity, I don’t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as, but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company. In my opinion, they have moved past Adobe, Sketch, and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor, Lovable, and other AI coding platforms. My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely single-player and code-first with no enterprise lock-in moat. This was further solidified when I saw Google invested. Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lock-ups expiring. Here are my supporting theses: 1. **Figma beat Adobe XD, Sketch, and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design, not because it packed more designer features.** * Browser native * Real-time collaboration * Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative. This is Figma’s premise, and this is why Cursor, Lovable, and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments. 2. **Adobe offered $20B to acquire Figma in 2022, before AI coding platforms became cool.** At that time: * ARR was rougely \\~$400M * Figma was just a design collab tool * AI wasn’t core to the product story yet Fast forward: * ARR now \\~$1B+ * Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting. And what led me to frame this POV. 3. **Enterprise Lock-in.** This may be the most under-appreciated part. The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include (“must know Figma”) along with process and governance changes which are hard to break. Switching becomes organizationally painful. This enterprise lock-in is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms. Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack, in the end. But this time, with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multi-player strength that other platforms won’t be able to compete with. Not to mention the amount of legal, security, and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise. Figma is already there. 4. **Complete AI Co-Creation Suite.** While most companies slap AI on top, Figma does something far more intentional. It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation (**Figjam**), design & prototyping (**Design**), build (**Make**), and deployment (**Site**) of apps with AI, all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process. One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year. This will help them accelerate a \"design to CMS-powered website\" workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix, Squarespace, and WP. If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard. It is really not. What’s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete, cohesive, and easy-to-use. How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform? 5. **The role of the designer and developer are converging.** One way to look at it is, the pool of seats (i.e. TAM) became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design. This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors, not the fastest created but looks cookie-cutter. 6. **A potential acquisition target to big tech giants.** Now this is highly speculative but: * What if google wanted a true end-to-end product creation stack * What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office * What if Amazon wanted a creative + dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise, creation, collaboration, AI, and design systems. That scarcity matters. The potential for big acquisition is not far-fetched. **Personal position:** I’ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around \\~$34 and believes this will have a big move, once investors catch on to the true potential. Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game, and I'm invested for the long-term.",

      "selftext_processed": "I dont know why my post got deleted earlier but I would like to repost anyway . Just sharing my big picture point of view on Figma and get other perspectives from the community here . I think Figma is no_longer the same company that Adobe tried to acquire for $ 20B . It ’ s definitely grown bigger in terms of ARR suite of AI offerings and more disruptive than ever in the age of AI . What O365 is for productivity Figma is for creativity . By creativity I don ’ t mean just being a design collaboration tool like what most consider it as but an end to end digital product creation platform which is the anchor to my bullish outlook for this company . In my opinion they have moved past Adobe Sketch and others as they are the clear industry leader now in the product design space and have now set their sights on Cursor Lovable and other AI coding platforms . My big bet is they will win because those tools are largely singleplayer and codefirst with no_enterprise lockin moat . This was further solidified when I saw Google invested . Institutions are positioning and the stock seems to have found a floor despite lockups expiring . Here are my supporting theses 1 . Figma beat Adobe XD Sketch and others because it was a multiplayer platform by design not_because it packed more designer features . Browser native Realtime collaboration Design systems Scalable product development is inherently collaborative . This is Figma ’ s premise and this is why Cursor Lovable and others will hit the ceiling in enterprise environments . 2 . Adobe offered $ 20B to acquire Figma in 2022 before AI coding platforms became cool . At that time ARR was rougely $ 400M Figma was just a design collab tool AI wasn ’ t core to the product story yet Fast forward ARR now $ 1B Product suite has expanded massively That it is valued below what Adobe was willing to pay then seems interesting . And what led me to frame this POV . 3 . Enterprise Lockin . This may be the most underappreciated part . The enterprise has standardized around Figma which means hiring for positions include “ must know Figma ” along with process and governance changes which are hard to break . Switching becomes organizationally painful . This enterprise lockin is a massive advantage and what will drive them to win despite the early advantages of AI coding platforms . Think how Microsoft Teams won vs Slack in the end . But this time with a much bigger value proposition in Figma in its coherent AI strategy and inherent multiplayer strength that other platforms won ’ t be able to compete with . Not_to mention the amount of legal security and privacy requirements they need to deal with in order to activate scale in an enterprise . Figma is already there . 4 . Complete AI CoCreation Suite . While most companies slap AI on top Figma does something far more intentional . It is taking the entire product development lifecycle and weaving every step together from ideation Figjam design prototyping Design build Make and deployment Site of apps with AI all with the affordance of human agency and curation in the process . One commenter from my earlier post highlighted that Figma have acquired PayLoadCMS last year . This will help them accelerate a design to CMSpowered website workflow that will eat away from platforms like Wix Squarespace and WP . If you think about what Cursor and Lovable did is hard . It is really not_What ’ s hard is integrating features in a way that feels complete cohesive and easytouse . How many enterprises will risk having a disjointed design and development tooling ecosystem when they can have everything in one platform 5 . The role of the designer and developer are converging . One way to look at it is the pool of seats i.e . TAM became larger as designers get into engineering work while developers get into design . This is powerful as the most value will always come from the most creative of endeavors not_the fastest created but looks cookiecutter . 6 . A potential acquisition target to big tech giants . Now this is highly speculative but What if google wanted a true endtoend product creation stack What if Microsoft wanted to own creation beyond Office What if Amazon wanted a creative dev OS There are very few platforms that sit in the intersection of enterprise creation collaboration AI and design systems . That scarcity matters . The potential for big acquisition is not_farfetched . Personal position I ’ ve been accumulating shares since the stock hit its floor at around $ 34 and believes this will have a big move once investors catch on to the true potential . Adding a screenshot of my position just to show that I have skin in the game and Im invested for the longterm ."

      "selftext": "If you bother or care to look up my post history I posted on thetagang about this strat already, but posting here this time to keep a log of sorts which I’ll update my positions on. (Don’t expect any big numbers, I have a small account < 10K) The inverse iron condor strat: So a regular iron condor is simple enough. An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit, defined risk/reward, long theta, short Vega, delta neutral at start. The DTE is your choice, but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty, which makes sense (you want the price to stay between your short strikes, and thus let the entire spread expire worthless). The other well-known strat is a reverse or long iron condor, which is an otm debit put and call spread, and this time it’s short theta, long Vega, delta neutral at start. This one you want the price to move drastically up or down. With me so far? Congrats, you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly. So, what’s different with the inverse iron condor? Simple, my problem was this: I hate entering a trade for a debit. And my thesis? Markets don’t stay the same in a longer period of time. Solution: open a fully itm credit call/put spread for a net CREDIT, short theta, LONG Vega, delta neutral at start, and we want price to move drastically now. Give yourself a bit of time for market to move (95DTE approx), and bob’s your uncle. But, you tell me, you’re really dumb. You could’ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same P/L outlook. Aren’t you even thinking about early assignment? Why yes, dear reader. You are absolutely correct. Because of early assignment risk, I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is European-style. As for the condor, I forgor 💀 (really, that’s the only reason. Do a regular credit condor if you want I’m not your mom). So to sum up, buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry, same strike widths apart. Market dumps, you win. Market rallies, you win! Market flatlines, you lose. If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT’s help, I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole. For now here’s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat, which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don’t want to mess around with early assignment risk.",

Don ’ t expect any big numbers I have a small account 10K The inverse iron condor strat So a regular iron condor is simple enough . An otm call credit spread and otm put credit spread for an initial credit defined riskreward long theta short Vega delta neutral at start . The DTE is your choice but I hear short dated is better because less uncertainty which makes sense you want the price to stay between your short strikes and thus let the entire spread expire worthless . The other wellknown strat is a reverse or long iron condor which is an otm debit put and call spread and this time it ’ s short theta long Vega delta neutral at start . This one you want the price to move drastically up or down . With me so far Congrats you just got a short explanation on standard and reverse iron condors from yours truly . So what ’ s different with the inverse iron condor Simple my problem was this I hate entering a trade for a debit . And my thesis Markets don ’ t stay the same in a longer period of time . Solution open a fully itm credit callput spread for a net CREDIT short theta LONG Vega delta neutral at start and we want price to move drastically now . Give yourself a bit of time for market to move 95DTE approx and bob ’ s your uncle . But you tell me you ’ re really dumb . You could ’ ve just opened a credit condor using all calls or all puts for the same PL outlook . Aren ’ t you even thinking about early assignment Why yes dear reader . You are absolutely correct . Because of early assignment risk I have decided this strategy is best for SPX which is Europeanstyle . As for the condor I forgor 💀 really that ’ s the only reason . Do a regular credit condor if you want I ’ m not_your mom . So to sum up buy fully ITM call and put spreads same expiry same strike widths apart . Market dumps you win . Market rallies you win Market flatlines you lose . If any one of you says this was done with chatGPT ’ s help I will find you and stuff rocks up your butt hole . For now here ’ s a screenshot of my SPY position that used the same strat which I plan on exiting ASAP because I don ’ t want to mess around with early assignment risk ."

      "title": "Silver moonshot yolo on Pan American $PAAS",
      "selftext": "I'm young and naïve enough to think that this time's parabolic rise in silver is different from the short-lived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers. Michael Lynch's work has shown that bullion banks, contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes, have bought into strength this time around, as opposed to 'selling at the highs' in silver contracts: [ I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, in which many banks initially caught off-sides on credit default swaps, then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis, before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape. That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price, after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side. For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market, I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbell's Substack, which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater: [ **Why Pan American Silver $PAAS?** [Handsome Silver Miners]( Because Rick Rule likes the stock, this is the primary reason. Who is this guy Rick? I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds; it doesn't really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks, as long as it works. [Pan American Founder and real-life Indiana Jones global explorer]( The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong, high cash flow enterprise, $PAAS holds three massive non-producing silver mega-projects across LATAM: Navidad, Escobal and La Colorada Skarn. While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver, they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the company's books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory & community based opposition, as a result their incredible value is not appropriately reflected in Pan American's valuation. However recent American big-stick resource 'diplomacy' across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions. This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela, as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia, Greenland and Mexico. Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from high-performance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure, as well as silver's critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes, I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production. In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term, Pan American's three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations. Escobal was a fully functioning, monster silver mine in decades past, mothballed only due to non-technical, social/legal considerations. La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing, world-class silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent. Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive, newly rationalized Argentinian government. If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon, which I believe should've been yesterday, Pan American Silver's trio of mega-projects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy. **Disclosure and positions**: I've been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls. Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not a financial professional in any capacity.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im young and naïve enough to think that this times parabolic rise in silver is different from the shortlived prior runs like those from 2011 or the Hunt Brothers . Michael Lynchs work has shown that bullion banks contrary to their behavior in prior silver spikes have bought into strength this time around as opposed to selling at the highs in silver contracts I see this as akin to positioning around the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis in which many banks initially caught offsides on credit default swaps then repositioned to take advantage of the mounting crisis before the mortgage marks were allowed to hit the tape . That the bullion banks are going long into this parabolic rise in silver suggests to me that this could be the prelude to a far more material revaluation in the silver price after bullion banks have fully repositioned on the long side . For further background on the fundamentals of the silver market I highly recommend reading through Alexander Campbells Substack which he generously provides for free drawing upon his experience as commodities head at Bridgewater Why Pan American Silver $ PAAS Handsome Silver Miners Because Rick Rule likes the stock this is the primary reason . Who is this guy Rick I can personally attest that commodity stocks he likes have a tendency to levitate without bounds it doesnt really matter if he uses technical analysis or voodoo magic to divine the trajectories of mining stocks as long as it works . Pan American Founder and reallife Indiana Jones global explorer The secondary reason I choose Pan American is that in addition to being a fundamentally strong high cash flow enterprise $ PAAS holds three massive nonproducing silver megaprojects across LATAM Navidad Escobal and La Colorada Skarn . While these projects contain ludicrous amounts of silver they have remained dormant for decades sitting on the companys books because of extraordinary capital intensity as well as regulatory community based opposition as a result their incredible value is not_appropriately reflected in Pan Americans valuation . However recent American bigstick resource diplomacy across the Americas suggests a far more interventionist stance in promoting regional resource extraction irrespective of local opinions . This can be seen in recent American adventures in Venezuela as well as rhetoric and kinetic asset repositioning around Colombia Greenland and Mexico . Given that silver has incredibly important applications in modern tech from highperformance batteries and solar panels needed to compete with Chinese power infrastructure as well as silvers critical role in advanced weaponry such as patriot missiles and torpedoes I would presume that future American adventures in Mexico and other LATAM jurisdictions will involve a certain predisposition towards securing and enabling silver production . In terms of moving the needle on regional silver production in the relatively near term Pan Americans three major silver projects sit at the forefront of policy considerations . Escobal was a fully functioning monster silver mine in decades past mothballed only due to nontechnical sociallegal considerations . La Colorada Skarn is a monster silver deposit right next to ongoing worldclass silver mining operations with excellent regional infrastructure and talent . Navidad is another monster silver deposit under a highly supportive newly rationalized Argentinian government . If America decides it needs to ramp up silver production anytime soon which I believe shouldve been yesterday Pan American Silvers trio of megaprojects may well be among the principal beneficiaries of such industrial policy . Disclosure and positions Ive been long the stock for a while and now hold a fair bit of calls . Take my opinions with a boulder of salt as I am not_a financial professional in any capacity ."
