With earnings soon, I’m thinking this~ - If negatively received, avg down my last $20k in HOOG after more bleeding. Then wait. - If positively received and guidance is strong. With my last 20k, buy some OTM calls 3 month DTE. We will see the narrative shift, there is a lot going for HOOD. Tin hat here: TRUMP accounts get approved & funded, prediction markets rally, international market share grows, share buy backs continue, revenue growth from new products increase, crypto recovers, & tokenization of securities is rolled out. $200?

      "selftext": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade (for the stocks he got when he sold his company). Mid last year, a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm, QS, Sofi, etc were doing very well. They were at their respective ATH. Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax (including some STCG). And nobody knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH. So apart from potential higher taxes, the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market. But then, what if market reverses the direction from here ? The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns - gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside. Cost was just a little premium (collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC - and if you choose different months for the put and calls, the cost could be 0 or even positive). Eg. QS reached highs n late 2025. And now it is back to \\~8 (down 50% than the highs). But a collar position with expiry in 2026, I paid just a little premium - allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices. And gave me right to sell at \\~16 even if stock goes down - which turned out the case. Now even when it is at \\~8, I shall be able to sell at \\~$16. I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating. I wish, I had known this in 2021/22 when we had such peaks and then big drops. Sharing as it has helped me. See if it helps you in the future. This is not an advice. DYOR. Good luck!",

      "selftext_processed": "I learnt last year about how Mark Cuban saved his fortune during dot com bubble burst with a collar options trade for the stocks he got when he sold his company . Mid last year a lot of stocks from my portfolio such as Affirm QS Sofi etc were doing very well . They were at their respective ATH . Getting out that point would have got good gains but all would have added to overall tax including some STCG . And nobody_knew if these stocks were going to make further ATH . So apart from potential higher taxes the FOMO on new ATH in each of these bigger winners was as real as it could get in an exuberant market . But then what if market reverses the direction from here The collar trade addressed most of those feelings and concerns gave that chance to wait and see if new ATH are achieved while also protecting from the downside . Cost was just a little premium collar results in less net premium than just buying a put as you sell a CC and if you choose different months for the put and calls the cost could be 0 or even positive . Eg . QS reached highs n late 2025 . And now it is back to 8 down 50 % than the highs . But a collar position with expiry in 2026 I paid just a little premium allowed me to wait to see if I can sell my position even at higher prices . And gave me right to sell at 16 even if stock goes down which turned out the case . Now even when it is at 8 I shall be able to sell at $ 16 . I can reenter and then DCA some of these names again if the market keeps deteriorating . I wish I had known this in 202122 when we had such peaks and then big drops . Sharing as it has helped me . See if it helps you in the future . This is not_an advice . DYOR . Good luck"

      "title": "SBLX - Cash Rich Sleeper That Benefits From the Crypto Sell-Off",
      "selftext": "**StableX Technologies** **Ticker: SBLX (NASDAQ)** **Shares Outstanding: 1.4m** **Public Float: 1.2m** **Cash/Treasuries: $11m** **Liquid Assets Per Share: $8.05** **Debt: Zero** **Closing Stock Price: $2.71 (2/4/26)** StableX Technologies (NASDAQ: SBLX) is a cash-rich ($7.59 per share, zero debt) micro float sleeper stock that has been overlooked because of its conversion to a Digital Asset Treasury strategy. As [this article]( in yesterday’s Wall Street Journal pointed out in greater detail, the strategy that rewarded companies for hoarding crypto is now punishing them. Almost all crypto prices have plummeted 40-60% over the last few months, in most cases crushing the balance sheets of the companies who have bought the most crypto. As investors in such Digital Asset Treasuries dump their shares indiscriminately amidst the chaos, one such company appears to be the baby thrown out with the bathwater. StableX Technologies’ (NASDAQ: SBLX) shares have been dumped like all the rest, with a sell off of 65% since the announcement of the company’s pivot to a Digital Asset Treasury Strategy. But SBLX appears to be in a different position than most DATs because the company did not aggressively invest all of its cash into cryptocurrencies in the weeks or even months after the announcement. As of the [most recent filings, SBLX has maintained a rock-solid balance sheet]( with minimal crypto selloff exposure, and a structure that turns potential dilution into a cash windfall. SBLX isn’t just surviving the downturn, it’s perfectly positioned to thrive when the crypto market recovers. Let’s dive into why this under-the-radar stock could deliver explosive returns for investors who buy SBLX shares in the current trading range. []( **A Fortress of Cash in Uncertain Times** At the heart of SBLX’s appeal is its enviable liquidity position. As of the latest filings, the company boasts $11 million in short term US treasuries (essentially cash). With only 1.4m shares outstanding, that equates to about $7.55 per share in safe, yield-generating assets that should provide a bulletproof buffer against market turmoil. Add another +/- 50 cents per share in crypto holdings (after investing only a small percentage of their cash into crypto), and you have at a total of $8.05 per share in liquid assets because the company only has **1,455,975 total shares outstanding.** Why does this matter now? Crypto’s recent tanking has hammered DATs across the board, with thinly traded stocks like SBLX getting caught in the crossfire. But unlike many of its peers, SBLX didn’t go all-in on volatile digital assets at the recent highs. It entered this downturn with the vast majority of its hoard in cash equivalents, making the recent selloff of SBLX shares the ultimate “baby thrown out with the bathwater” scenario. While others are scrambling to shore up their books, SBLX is sitting pretty, ready to deploy that capital strategically at these much more attractive prices. In a market where liquidity is king, SBLX’s $11 million war chest is kind of a big deal. **Tiny Float, Big Potential: The Setup for a Significant Move Higher** SBLX’s share structure is tailor-made for volatility in the best way possible. With only 1,455,975 shares outstanding as of December 18, 2025, and about 227,800 of those locked up by [two institutional investors]( the effective float is a mere 1.2 million shares. That’s incredibly tight for a stock in this space, meaning even modest buying pressure could send the price soaring. **The negativity surrounding SBLX stems from a few misconceptions**. First, the original company’s electric car business didn’t pan out, leading to the pivot to the new StableX strategy; a fresh start focused on digital assets. Second, legacy holders dumped shares soon after the crypto pivot was announced, causing an initial plunge. Third, the broader crypto sell-off dragged DATs down indiscriminately, and SBLX’s tiny float meant it couldn’t catch a bid amidst the panic. But here’s the bullish twist: This overreaction has created a once-in-a-cycle entry point. Investors who recognize SBLX’s underlying strength, ([market savvy advisors]( paired with large cash reserves to take advantage of the crypto selloff) and invest at this huge discount to the net cash value can benefit disproportionately as the crypto market stabilizes and starts to move higher again. **Debunking the Dilution Myth: Warrants as a Catalyst, Not a Curse** One of the biggest bearish narratives around SBLX (and other DATs) is the specter of “massive dilution” from outstanding warrants. There are about 11 million warrants that could theoretically balloon the share count by over 1,000%. Sounds scary, right? Not so fast. The reality is far more investor-friendly. Warrant conversions don’t kick in until the stock trades above $6.20, with a whopping 90% (10.5 million) requiring the stock to reach $8 or higher. From current levels, that means no conversions without at least a 100%+ gain in the stock price and no major conversions until 155% upside. If we hit those thresholds? SBLX doesn’t get diluted; it gets flooded with cash with up to $100 million from exercises. Think about it: Each new share issued adds $6.19 or $8+ in fresh capital to the company. For buyers stepping in now, this isn’t dilution, it’s accretion. The influx would supercharge SBLX’s ability to capitalize on cheap crypto assets during this downturn, turning a market weakness into a strategic advantage. Executives are highly incentivized to make this happen sooner rather than later. With crypto prices depressed, deploying that incoming liquidity could lock in bargains that pay off handsomely on the rebound. It’s a virtuous cycle: Rising stock price triggers warrants, which fuel growth, which drives the stock even higher. **The Bottom Line: A Rare Asymmetrical Opportunity in a Sea of Red** SBLX stands apart in today’s crypto downturn: a company with $8.05 per share in liquid assets; mostly safe, short-term US Treasuries that are trading at a deep discount to its underlying cash value. With a tiny 1.2 million-share float, what may be as much as $11 million of dry powder, and a warrant structure that only adds shares when it simultaneously injects $6.20–$8+ of fresh capital per share, the setup is unusually attractive. Management has clear incentives to put that capital to work at today’s depressed crypto prices, positioning the company to compound value as markets eventually recover. This isn’t speculation on a quick rebound; it’s buying a dollar of high-quality, liquid assets for significantly less; backed by a balance sheet that gets stronger as the stock rises. For patient investors, SBLX appears to represent one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the digital-asset treasury space right now. Thoughtful accumulation at these levels could be handsomely rewarded as the true value of its fortress-like balance sheet becomes more widely recognized and understood. \\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Not financial advice, DYOR.

      "selftext_processed": "StableX Technologies Ticker SBLX NASDAQ Shares Outstanding 1.4m Public Float 1.2m CashTreasuries $ 11m Liquid Assets Per Share $ 8.05 Debt Zero Closing Stock Price $ 2.71 2426 StableX Technologies NASDAQ SBLX is a cashrich $ 7.59 per share zero debt micro float sleeper stock that has been overlooked because of its conversion to a Digital Asset Treasury strategy . As this article in yesterday ’ s Wall Street Journal pointed out in greater detail the strategy that rewarded companies for hoarding crypto is now punishing them . Almost all crypto prices have plummeted 4060 % over the last few months in most cases crushing the balance sheets of the companies who have bought the most crypto . As investors in such Digital Asset Treasuries dump their shares indiscriminately amidst the chaos one such company appears to be the baby thrown out with the bathwater . StableX Technologies ’ NASDAQ SBLX shares have been dumped like all the rest with a sell off of 65 % since the announcement of the company ’ s pivot to a Digital Asset Treasury Strategy . But SBLX appears to be in a different position than most DATs because the company did not_aggressively invest all of its cash into cryptocurrencies in the weeks or even months after the announcement . As of the most recent filings SBLX has maintained a rocksolid balance sheet with minimal crypto selloff exposure and a structure that turns potential dilution into a cash windfall . SBLX isn ’ t just surviving the downturn it ’ s perfectly positioned to thrive when the crypto market recovers . Let ’ s dive into why this undertheradar stock could deliver explosive returns for investors who buy SBLX shares in the current trading range . A Fortress of Cash in Uncertain Times At the heart of SBLX ’ s appeal is its enviable liquidity position . As of the latest filings the company boasts $ 11 million in short term US treasuries essentially cash . With only 1.4m shares outstanding that equates to about $ 7.55 per share in safe yieldgenerating assets that should provide a bulletproof buffer against market turmoil . Add another 50 cents per share in crypto holdings after investing only a small percentage of their cash into crypto and you have at a total of $ 8.05 per share in liquid assets because the company only has 1455975 total shares outstanding . Why does this matter now Crypto ’ s recent tanking has hammered DATs across the board with thinly traded stocks like SBLX getting caught in the crossfire . But unlike many of its peers SBLX didn ’ t go allin on volatile digital assets at the recent highs . It entered this downturn with the vast majority of its hoard in cash equivalents making the recent selloff of SBLX shares the ultimate “ baby thrown out with the bathwater ” scenario . While others are scrambling to shore up their books SBLX is sitting pretty ready to deploy that capital strategically at these much more attractive prices . In a market where liquidity is king SBLX ’ s $ 11 million war chest is kind of a big deal . Tiny Float Big Potential The Setup for a Significant Move Higher SBLX ’ s share structure is tailormade for volatility in the best way possible . With only 1455975 shares outstanding as of December 18 2025 and about 227800 of those locked up by two institutional investors the effective float is a mere 1.2 million shares . That ’ s incredibly tight for a stock in this space meaning even modest buying pressure could send the price soaring . The negativity surrounding SBLX stems from a few misconceptions . First the original company ’ s electric car business didn ’ t pan out leading to the pivot to the new StableX strategy a fresh start focused on digital assets . Second legacy holders dumped shares soon after the crypto pivot was announced causing an initial plunge . Third the broader crypto selloff dragged DATs down indiscriminately and SBLX ’ s tiny float meant it couldn ’ t catch a bid amidst the panic . But here ’ s the bullish twist This overreaction has created a onceinacycle entry point . Investors who recognize SBLX ’ s underlying strength market savvy advisors paired with large cash reserves to take advantage of the crypto selloff and invest at this huge discount to the net cash value can benefit disproportionately as the crypto market stabilizes and starts to move higher again . Debunking the Dilution Myth Warrants as a Catalyst Not_a Curse One of the biggest bearish narratives around SBLX and other DATs is the specter of “ massive dilution ” from outstanding warrants . There are about 11 million warrants that could theoretically balloon the share count by over 1000 % . Sounds scary right Not_so fast . The reality is far more investorfriendly . Warrant conversions don ’ t kick in until the stock trades above $ 6.20 with a whopping 90 % 10.5 million requiring the stock to reach $ 8 or higher . From current levels that means no_conversions without at least a 100 % gain in the stock price and no_major conversions until 155 % upside . If we hit those thresholds SBLX doesn ’ t get diluted it gets flooded with cash with up to $ 100 million from exercises . Think about it Each new share issued adds $ 6.19 or $ 8 in fresh capital to the company . For buyers stepping in now this isn ’ t dilution it ’ s accretion . The influx would supercharge SBLX ’ s ability to capitalize on cheap crypto assets during this downturn turning a market weakness into a strategic advantage . Executives are highly incentivized to make this happen sooner rather than later . With crypto prices depressed deploying that incoming liquidity could lock in bargains that pay off handsomely on the rebound . It ’ s a virtuous cycle Rising stock price triggers warrants which fuel growth which drives the stock even higher . The Bottom Line A Rare Asymmetrical Opportunity in a Sea of Red SBLX stands apart in today ’ s crypto downturn a company with $ 8.05 per share in liquid assets mostly safe shortterm US Treasuries that are trading at a deep discount to its underlying cash value . With a tiny 1.2 millionshare float what may be as much as $ 11 million of dry powder and a warrant structure that only adds shares when it simultaneously injects $ 6.20– $ 8 of fresh capital per share the setup is unusually attractive . Management has clear incentives to put that capital to work at today ’ s depressed crypto prices positioning the company to compound value as markets eventually recover . This isn ’ t speculation on a quick rebound it ’ s buying a dollar of highquality liquid assets for significantly less backed by a balance sheet that gets stronger as the stock rises . For patient investors SBLX appears to represent one of the most asymmetric opportunities in the digitalasset treasury space right now . Thoughtful accumulation at these levels could be handsomely rewarded as the true value of its fortresslike balance sheet becomes more widely recognized and understood . Not_financial advice DYOR .

[$8 Billion]( That gives us a PE ratio of, checks notes, 187. (Edit: I've been informed in the comments that 8B is EBITDA, not earnings, so the PE ratio is probably north of 300. NOICE.) Now, this is 2026, PE ratios are about as relevant as a telegraph operators fingering speed, but still, there must be _some_ narrative to command such a rocketship valuation, right? Ah, yes. Datacenters in space. Sure, Elon is the world's biggest bullshit factory, but at least most of his bullshit looks appetizing if you squint. Self driving cars? Yeah! Robotaxis? Sure! Humanoid sexdolls? Why not! But what the fuck is a DATACENTER IN SPACE good for. We've got datacenters at home, goddamit. (Of course, it goes without saying that the whole X.ai acquisition is a shit tamale wrapped in a shit sandwich, a shitducken so to speak, but whose counting shit here). Here is my prediction. Unlike you highly regarded turd chompers, IPO investors are a legitimately sophisticated bunch. There will be a roadshow, and pension funds, endowments, etc will actually have to _smell_ the shit before chomping on it. And I don't think they will. So instead of the famously diamond-handed Punxatawney Teachers Union buying a chunk of the IPO, it will be desperate buyers of ~~hand grenades~~ hot potatoes who just want to watch it pop like god's asterisk on poppers at the adult cinema before shifting it to the next victim. Now, that may be irrelevant when the pop is for fucking _figma_, but we're talking SpaceX here. _Elon_. Either the IPO doesn't happen or when it does it will drop like the challenger shuttle. And people will panic. The entire AI narrative that has been holding on our K-shaped economy will blow up like a little kid flying into space when his fat cousin jumps off the see-saw. Bye, timmy.

Do you follow any particular traders or groups regularly to stay in sync with the market or help with trade decisions? I am not talking about hype or guaranteed profit stuff. More like people whose analysis you actually check during the trading day. Solid chart reading, market structure, bias or levels that help you decide entries or stay patient. Also wondering if anyone follows any signal services, live chart reading sessions or private groups that they genuinely use while trading, not just for education. If there are some really good ones out there that you actually rely on or reference often, please share. Would love to know what’s been useful for you in real trading.",

      "selftext": "I hope he reads this headline because I mean it. I‘ve following Michael Burry for quite a while, and he’s generally likable, has a decent understanding of macroeconomics, but he broad-brushes scenarios across industries he doesn’t fully understand the mechanics of. My first flag of doubt came after he spoke on how the index investors were making a huge mistake by moving into passive ETFs. He claimed that ETF sponsors would not know how to navigate massive liquidity events, where either the ETF shares or the underlying assets would face major selling pressures and decouple. This, I believe, stemmed from a complete misunderstanding on how the ETFs are created and destroyed and the markets that make them in the first place. Since the rise in ETF‘s popularity, there have been quite a number of events that tested his hypothesis and proved him to be wrong. Overtly wrong. His more recent callout was directed towards the decline of Bitcoin and how it would be fatal to the big-name mining companies. I read what he’s put out there to make sure I wasn’t grossly overlooking anything, and after doing some scenario testing at a $35-45k price point, I can honestly say there is not remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he’s supposing we’ll see. I‘m not a bitcoin guy. I love the blockchain technology, but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin. Recently, I’ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies. I think crypto mining and staking isn’t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies. I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA, your company isn’t at risk of disappearing overnight. Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors: a lack of balance sheet flexibility, lack of liquidity to maintain operations, declining operating income, persistent DSCR <1, or high maintenance capital costs. pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy. Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy (who hasn’t?). …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor’s, he’s far from bankrupt. MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt. MARA, the other company he’s picked on, also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow. Though their bankruptcy risk is a non-zero probability, it’s still incredibly low. The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it’s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin. Done. That‘s all to be said. I‘d accept that warning all day. Everything else is just noise.",

I read what he ’ s put out there to make sure I wasn ’ t grossly overlooking anything and after doing some scenario testing at a $ 3545k price point I can honestly say there is not_remotely the profound bankruptcy risk he ’ s supposing we ’ ll see . I ‘ m not_a bitcoin guy . I love the blockchain technology but I own exactly .0015 bitcoin . Recently I ’ ve come to appreciate the economics of some of the mining companies . I think crypto mining and staking isn ’ t going anywhere as the use case continues to build for these technologies . I say all this because if you are holding stocks like MARA your company isn ’ t at risk of disappearing overnight . Bankruptcy happens when the debt itself grows burdensome due to a combo of a few factors a lack of balance sheet flexibility lack of liquidity to maintain operations declining operating income persistent DSCR 1 or high maintenance capital costs . pick any random 2 scenarios from the list and only then do you have the recipe for conjuring a bankruptcy . Michael Burry also went on to take a stab at Microstrategy who hasn ’ t . …As much as I detest companies like that of Michael Saylor ’ s he ’ s far from bankrupt . MSTR still has asset coverage to pay down debt . MARA the other company he ’ s picked on also has balance sheet flexibility and decent operating cash flow . Though their bankruptcy risk is a nonzero probability it ’ s still incredibly low . The more honest analysis from him would be valuation impairment is imminent and it ’ s a long road to reclaiming their highs without price performance from Bitcoin . Done . That ‘ s all to be said . I ‘ d accept that warning all day . Everything else is just noise ."

Keep in account china accounted for 25% of sales from NVDA Down to now 8% this happened due to export regulations on WEAKER H20 CHIPS.. now significantly more valuable H200 chips just got green light from 🥭 waiting on NVDA approval huge turn of events. I can’t post in DD section yet as I don’t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn. This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we’re talking 25 + Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models. Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April. Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I’ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow.

      "selftext_processed": "NVDA 🥭 approved NVDA H200 chips strictly for commercially viable companies Bytedancealabaia DeepSeek etc . When NVDA said early last year that ’ ll cost them 5.5 Billion in 1 quarter April 2025 for the ban likely 20 billion on year . Keep in account china accounted for 25 % of sales from NVDA Down to now 8 % this happened due to export regulations on WEAKER H20 CHIPS .. now significantly more valuable H200 chips just got green light from 🥭 waiting on NVDA approval huge turn of events . I can ’ t post in DD section yet as I don ’ t have a position cause this news is fresh and the market is still in downturn . This will be absolutely HUGE for Nvidia we ’ re talking 25 Billion in revenue maybe more due to increased cost of the chips from old models . Sales are projected to be started before trumps meeting with XI in April . Market is at a massive discount that has killed investor confidence this is the most golden opportunity I ’ ve ever encountered I will be buying aggressively for Jan 2027 200 calls and post positions tomorrow . GL fellas . I should be vouched for on promised positions tomorrow as I ’ ve been posting in here for over a year and always update positions ."

The Cash Flow Situation Here's what stood out: FY2025 showed record operating cash flow of $64B (up from $28B in FY2024), which sounds amazing on the surface. But when you look at where that cash actually went, financing and investment activities consumed a massive chunk of it. A significant portion went toward share repurchases, which is great for shareholders now but does reduce flexibility if things slow down. Balance Sheet Changes Worth Noting Total assets jumped roughly 70% YoY to $111B. Impressive growth, but the composition is interesting. Net receivables and inventories both more than doubled. That inventory number moving from $5.3B to $10.1B particularly got my attention given all the chatter about production lead times and the rapid product cycles in this space. Industry Convergence Intel's GPU initiative and Broadcom's AI ASIC deals point to growing fragmentation in the AI hardware market. The competitive moat is real but the walls may be getting shorter. What I'm Still Analyzing There are several other data points around ecosystem risks, supply chain concentration, margin trends, and how these factors could compound together I pulled this analysis from \\[Finbase\\]( where they break down the full risk picture and I used \\[tradingview\\]( to view Nvidia’s financials.

      "selftext": "When Figma IPO’d, there was a lot of hype. It’s a great product, tons of designers use it, and it felt like one of those stocks you had to own. Now the stock is down about 80% from its IPO, and I’m wondering how people who bought in are feeling. Do you regret buying, or do you still believe in the company long term and see this as just part of the ride? For those who didn’t buy, does it feel like you dodged a bullet, or are you starting to think this might be a good chance to get in at a much lower price? With tech stocks getting hit hard and expectations coming back to earth, this seems like a good example of hype vs. reality. Curious to hear how everyone’s looking at it now.",

      "selftext": "[]( I spent the last year backtesting pattern performance across 500+ stocks. Here's what holds up when you look at real data instead of trading books from the 90s. Patterns with statistical edge: 1. Cup and Handle (62% success rate) \\- Timeframe: 30-90 days \\- Volume requirement: Handle must form on decreasing volume \\- Entry: Break above handle resistance with volume spike \\- Why it works: Actual consolidation after accumulation, not random noise 2. Ascending Triangle (58% success rate) \\- Timeframe: 20-60 days \\- Volume requirement: Must decrease into apex \\- Entry: Breakout above horizontal resistance \\- Why it works: Supply exhaustion is measurable, not subjective 3. Bull Flag (56% success rate) \\- Timeframe: 5-20 days \\- Volume requirement: Pole on high volume, flag on low volume \\- Entry: Break above flag resistance \\- Why it works: Short-term continuation has momentum backing 4. Double Bottom (54% success rate) \\- Timeframe: 30-90 days \\- Volume requirement: Second bottom on lower volume than first \\- Entry: Break above resistance between bottoms \\- Why it works: Support level tested twice = stronger base 5. Inverse Head and Shoulders (53% success rate) \\- Timeframe: 30-120 days \\- Volume requirement: Right shoulder lower volume than left \\- Entry: Neckline break on volume \\- Why it works: Clear reversal structure with volume confirmation Patterns that don't work (or barely beat a coin flip): 1. Head and Shoulders (48% success rate) - Basically random 2. Wedges (47% success rate) - Too subjective, everyone draws them differently 3. Pennants (49% success rate) - Work in theory, fail in practice due to false breaks Key finding: Volume confirmation matters more than pattern shape. A cup and handle without proper volume behavior drops to 51% success rate. Methodology note: Success = 5%+ gain within 30 days of breakout. Tested on daily charts, 2020-2024 data, excluded penny stocks under $5. What patterns do you actually trade? Curious if your experience matches the data.",

At least not cutting edge tech. Yesterday's tech (software) has been taken over by Today's tech (AI/Quantum/Robotics) Today's tech will be replaced by tomorrow's tech and so on. But the companies can survive. At least some if not all. There might already be projects done within the company on technologies that will replace today's cutting edge technologies. Some within these Big Tech companies, others outside of Big Tech but Big Tech can easily buy those companies. Say biotechnology becomes the next big thing that gets a lot of attention. Or Agriculture. With deep pockets, these companies can easily gain a lead and keep their top positions. Sure not all will survive and not all those who will be the top companies in the future are already at the top. But if I were to invest in tech etfs, I don't think I need to be worried I think these tech etfs should continuously beat the broader market. 10 year CAGR for vgt is 22.6% where's s&p 500 is 14.7%.

      "selftext": "I listened to the Microsoft and Google Q4 Earnings and although you can never be 100% confident going into an earnings report, I believe AMZN has a 95%+ chance of beating their earnings materially. Here's why I think that: * **Cloud -** Microsoft's Azure Growth was below market expectations (if you strip out OpenAI) - this also impacted AMZN stock price following Microsoft's earnings due to fears Cloud revenue broadly was decelerating QoQ with Capital spend ramping. However, GCP just reported and they grew cloud materially - with impressive backlog as well. I expect AWS to beat estimates and post 22-24% growth for AWS due to the following. 1. Azure doesn't have strong custom silicon (they are trying to catch-up with Maya) compared to GCP (TPUs) and AWS (Trainium) and I believe this will truly be more apparent this quarter. 2. Anthropic is *materially* over-performing estimates - they raised Revenue projections for 2025 & 2026 and their Enterprise in-roads and tools is one reason there was such a large sell-off in SaaS companies the past few days. Anthropic predominantly uses AWS **and** Amazon is one of the lead investors - they will show AWS growth from Anthropic usage & a paper-gain on their investment 3. AWS is still the gorilla in the room - they are still the primary cloud provider for most enterprises and government orgs ($581M Air Force contract announced a few weeks ago) * **Retail -** There have been reports Prime shipments were the largest in it's history this Christmas season - I think as more people consolidate purchasing, especially with economic pressure - there will be larger spend on AMZN retail & groceries per subscriber than historically * **Advertising -** AMZN is monetizing it's properties more with high margin $ ads. Prime Video, [Amazon.com]( etc. Even without potential margin expansion from restructurings and robotics in their fulfilment centers, I think this will be an extremely strong earnings report from Amazon. Whether the market reacts favorably or unfavorably due to increases in Capital spend (like it has with Microsoft & Google) will be a different story. I think based on the above and the potential for a Prime subscription price hike to mitigate tariff impacts (unless SCOTUS rules on it), AMZN is due for a stock run-up. The timing is not ideal with a broad tech sell-off the past week (and is why I'd stick to stock not short-dated options), but my Price Target is $250 - $260 after earnings and $300 EOY. Note this is not investment advice whatsoever and solely meant for discussion. What do ya'll think?",

      "selftext_processed": "I listened to the Microsoft and Google Q4 Earnings and although you can never_be 100 % confident going into an earnings report I believe AMZN has a 95 % chance of beating their earnings materially . Heres why I think that Cloud Microsofts Azure Growth was below market expectations if you strip out OpenAI this also impacted AMZN stock price following Microsofts earnings due to fears Cloud revenue broadly was decelerating QoQ with Capital spend ramping . However GCP just reported and they grew cloud materially with impressive backlog as well . I expect AWS to beat estimates and post 2224 % growth for AWS due to the following . 1 . Azure doesnt have strong custom silicon they are trying to catchup with Maya compared to GCP TPUs and AWS Trainium and I believe this will truly be more apparent this quarter . 2 . Anthropic is materially overperforming estimates they raised Revenue projections for 2025 2026 and their Enterprise inroads and tools is one reason there was such a large selloff in SaaS companies the past few days . Anthropic predominantly uses AWS and Amazon is one of the lead investors they will show AWS growth from Anthropic usage a papergain on their investment 3 . AWS is still the gorilla in the room they are still the primary cloud provider for most enterprises and government orgs $ 581M Air Force contract announced a few weeks ago Retail There have been reports Prime shipments were the largest in its history this Christmas season I think as more people consolidate purchasing especially with economic pressure there will be larger spend on AMZN retail groceries per subscriber than historically Advertising AMZN is monetizing its properties more with high margin $ ads . Prime Video Amazon.com etc . Even without potential margin expansion from restructurings and robotics in their fulfilment centers I think this will be an extremely strong earnings report from Amazon . Whether the market reacts favorably or unfavorably due to increases in Capital spend like it has with Microsoft Google will be a different story . I think based on the above and the potential for a Prime subscription price hike to mitigate tariff impacts unless SCOTUS rules on it AMZN is due for a stock runup . The timing is not_ideal with a broad tech selloff the past week and is why Id stick to stock not_shortdated options but my Price Target is $ 250 $ 260 after earnings and $ 300 EOY . Note this is not_investment advice whatsoever and solely meant for discussion . What do yall think"

      "title": "Risk analysis 101: Why entry signals are useless without downside measurement",
      "selftext": "Most trading content focuses on entry signals. Pattern detected. Breakout confirmed. Time to buy. But here's what nobody asks: *What's the downside if you're wrong?* **The problem with entry-only thinking:** Two stocks both show cup and handle breakouts today. * **Stock A**: Entry at $50. Support at $48. Downside risk: 4% * **Stock B**: Entry at $50. Support at $42. Downside risk: 16% Same pattern. Same entry price. Completely different risk profiles. If you're only looking at entry signals, these look identical. But Stock B can wreck your account on a failed breakout. **What downside measurement actually means:** Before entering any trade, you need three numbers: 1. **Entry price** – Where you're buying 2. **Target price** – Where you're taking profit 3. **Stop price** – Where you're wrong and need to exit From those, you get your **risk/reward ratio**. Example: * Entry: $50 * Target: $58 (16% upside) * Stop: $47 (6% downside) * Risk/reward: 2.67 to 1 **Why this matters more than win rate:** You can win 60% of trades and still lose money if your risk/reward sucks. * Win rate: 60% * Average win: +5% * Average loss: -8% * Net result: You're bleeding money Flip that: * Win rate: 45% * Average win: +12% * Average loss: -4% * Net result: You're profitable **How to measure downside on patterns:** 1. **Find the invalidation point** – Where is support? What price level makes this pattern \"broken\"? 2. **Calculate the distance** – How far from entry to invalidation? 3. **Compare to upside target** – Is the risk/reward worth it? **Cup and handle example:** * Entry: $52 (handle breakout) * Target: $60 (depth of cup added to breakout) * Stop: $49 (below handle low) * Downside: 5.8% * Upside: 15.4% * Risk/reward: 2.66 to 1 That's tradeable. **Bull flag example:** * Entry: $45 (flag breakout) * Target: $52 (pole height added to breakout) * Stop: $43 (below flag low) * Downside: 4.4% * Upside: 15.6% * Risk/reward: 3.5 to 1 Even better. **Red flags to avoid:** * Risk/reward below 2:1 (you need 70%+ win rate to profit) * Stop loss more than 10% away (too much downside) * No clear invalidation point (you're gambling, not trading) **Bottom line:** Entry signals get you into trades. Risk management keeps you in the game. Don't take a trade just because a pattern formed. Take it because the risk/reward makes sense. What's your minimum risk/reward ratio before entering?",

      "selftext_processed": "Most trading content focuses on entry signals . Pattern detected . Breakout confirmed . Time to buy . But heres what nobody_asks Whats the downside if youre wrong The problem with entryonly thinking Two stocks both show cup and handle breakouts today . Stock A Entry at $ 50 . Support at $ 48 . Downside risk 4 % Stock B Entry at $ 50 . Support at $ 42 . Downside risk 16 % Same pattern . Same entry price . Completely different risk profiles . If youre only looking at entry signals these look identical . But Stock B can wreck your account on a failed breakout . What downside measurement actually means Before entering any trade you need three numbers 1 . Entry price – Where youre buying 2 . Target price – Where youre taking profit 3 . Stop price – Where youre wrong and need to exit From those you get your riskreward ratio . Example Entry $ 50 Target $ 58 16 % upside Stop $ 47 6 % downside Riskreward 2.67 to 1 Why this matters more than win rate You can win 60 % of trades and still lose money if your riskreward sucks . Win rate 60 % Average win 5 % Average loss 8 % Net result Youre bleeding money Flip that Win rate 45 % Average win 12 % Average loss 4 % Net result Youre profitable How to measure downside on patterns 1 . Find the invalidation point – Where is support What price level makes this pattern broken 2 . Calculate the distance – How far from entry to invalidation 3 . Compare to upside target – Is the riskreward worth it Cup and handle example Entry $ 52 handle breakout Target $ 60 depth of cup added to breakout Stop $ 49 below handle low Downside 5.8 % Upside 15.4 % Riskreward 2.66 to 1 Thats tradeable . Bull flag example Entry $ 45 flag breakout Target $ 52 pole height added to breakout Stop $ 43 below flag low Downside 4.4 % Upside 15.6 % Riskreward 3.5 to 1 Even better . Red flags to avoid Riskreward below 21 you need 70 % win rate to profit Stop loss more than 10 % away too much downside No_clear invalidation point youre gambling not_trading Bottom line Entry signals get you into trades . Risk management keeps you in the game . Dont take a trade just because a pattern formed . Take it because the riskreward makes sense . Whats your minimum riskreward ratio before entering"

      "selftext": "I’ve been thinking a lot about where the next truly big investment opportunities are going to come from, and honestly, I’m struggling to get excited about what's possible right now. Obviously we have the big tech giants, but I'm talking about some long term multi bagger that I can jeet into. When you look at what VCs are funding today, SaaS apps, iOS apps & AI wrappers, it feels like competitive advantage is thinner than ever. Building software is cheaper, faster, and more accessible than at any point in history, I can literally make a Notion/Monday.com equivalent from my bed in 1 day. As a result, a lot of “moats” seem to boil down to marketing, distribution, or short-term execution rather than anything structural. That naturally compresses multiples over time. Then you zoom out to the layer these apps are built on: the AI models themselves. Most applications are model-agnostic. If you’re using OpenAI today, you can switch to Gemini, Claude, or another model tomorrow with relatively low friction. APIs are increasingly interchangeable, and customers don’t care *which* model you’re using as long as it works. Again, hard to see durable competitive advantage here. So you go one layer deeper: infrastructure,data centers, compute, chips. But here too, the picture isn’t great. These businesses are insanely capital intensive, require massive scale to generate decent returns, and are likely to be cash-flow negative for a long time. At the current valuations, it’s not obvious that risk-adjusted returns are attractive unless you’re already a hyperscaler. That leaves me with a question on where to invest next... If apps have weak moats, models are interchangeable, and infrastructure is capital-heavy with questionable economics… **where is the real, durable value being created in tech right now?** ik this is a pessimistic take, but I also don’t get excited about putting capital into KO, PEP, and consumer staples tbh nothing new there. I’m curious where people see *investable* opportunities that actually have long-term defensibility.",

Given this discrete tax benefit, AMSC’s net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $117.8 million, or $2.68 per share, compared to $2.5 million, or $0.07 per share, for the same period of fiscal 2024. The Company’s non-GAAP net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 was $123.5 million, or $2.81 per share, compared with a non-GAAP net income of $6.0 million, or $0.16 per share, in the same period of fiscal 2024. Please refer to the financial table below for a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP results. Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash on December 31, 2025, totaled $147.1 million, compared with $85.4 million at March 31, 2025. \"AMSC delivered an outstanding third quarter,\" said Daniel P. McGahn, Chairman, President, and CEO, AMSC. \"We grew revenue by more than 20% year-over-year, and marked our sixth consecutive quarter of profitability and our tenth of non-GAAP profitability. Reflecting our shift to profitability, we also recorded a tax benefit event this quarter. Again, gross margin exceeded 30% and we ended the quarter with over $145 million in cash after completing the acquisition of Comtrafo. Strong market demand drove bookings resulting in a robust 12-month backlog of over $250 million. Revenue through the past nine months nearly matches our total revenue for the entire prior fiscal year, highlighting our company's financial and end-market momentum.\" Business Outlook For the fourth quarter ending March 31, 2026, AMSC expects that its revenues will exceed $80.0 million. The Company’s net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 is expected to exceed $3.0 million, or $0.07 per share. The Company's non-GAAP net income (as defined below) is expected to exceed $8.0 million, or $0.17 per share.",

      "selftext": "Warren Buffet has taken a massive stake in OXY, now at approximately $12B. I am wondering if this stock looks attractive to anyone else? Things to consider: 1. Oil prices are hovering around 5 year lows, could see price tailwinds due to geopolitical tensions 2. Validation from Buffet at 27% stake; says he might own this stock \"forever\". Buffet also recently purchased their chemical division OxyChem, reducing company debt. 3. Occidental has approximately 40% stake in a company called NET Power (NPWR), who is working on emerging natural gas technology called super critical CO2 (sCO2). OXY has upwards of $350m invested in this company/technology. 4. Profitable company with dividend 2.12% dividend. (Nothing to write home about but there are a lot of unprofitable companies out there!) 5. PE ratio of 34x is expensive for E&P companies 6. Super critical CO2 is exciting technology (90% reduction in reactor size, zero emissions, etc.) but first commercial demonstration will not be proven out until 2028 at the earliest. Also faces competition from GEV and others. 7. Buffet's average cost is about $51.76 per share, so he is underwater on this one. What's your opinion, do you think Warren is wrong on this one or is it a smart 3-5 year play?",

Oil prices are hovering around 5 year lows could see price tailwinds due to geopolitical tensions 2 . Validation from Buffet at 27 % stake says he might own this stock forever . Buffet also recently purchased their chemical division OxyChem reducing company debt . 3 . Occidental has approximately 40 % stake in a company called NET Power NPWR who is working on emerging natural gas technology called super critical CO2 sCO2 . OXY has upwards of $ 350m invested in this companytechnology . 4 . Profitable company with dividend 2.12 % dividend . Nothing to write home about but there are a lot of unprofitable companies out there 5 . PE ratio of 34x is expensive for EP companies 6 . Super critical CO2 is exciting technology 90 % reduction in reactor size zero emissions etc . but first commercial demonstration will not_be proven out until 2028 at the earliest . Also faces competition from GEV and others . 7 . Buffets average cost is about $ 51.76 per share so he is underwater on this one . Whats your opinion do you think Warren is wrong on this one or is it a smart 35 year play"

This is fueled by AI they will bite the bullet now because in the end if they stay on top once the semiconductor prices drop down towards the end of the decade . The AI ship will be running smoothly and much cheaper . These companies can ’ t slow down or else they will literally fall behind . This is almost bound to happen with the really large names .

      "selftext": "Smart glasses are disrupting smartphones as the next generation human-to-computer interface. Meta leads in spending reportedly up to 100B in AR/VR efforts. Consumer, industrial and military adoption is happening fast. Phone makers are already abandoning hand-held devices for glasses. I'm more interested in growth exposure than getting a pair. This is Meta's best chance of entrenching its media platforms into next hardware transition. Apple is conjuring something and Google is jumping back into battle after defeat of its first Glass attempt. Samsung is Android armed but MSFT appears done with AR after handing its program over to Anduril. Competition is fierce. The Bigs are willing to ignore hardware profits to build or maintain walled gardens. Unlike with phones, China has access to US AR markets and doing very well. US companies will remain leaders as wearables become the ultimate AI infrastructure. Google seems favored with software advantage but Meta is clearly ahead in hardware. New, optical technology is driving most development and suppliers have potentially more growth opportunity than choosing between multi-trillion dollar market caps. AR tech has many directions but I'm focused on what Meta, the market leader is saying. Would love to learn more about LED projection leaders but they are mostly in Taiwan. Silicon Carbide (SiC) has emerged as holy grail of AR lens material. Most SiC stocks are down, apparently from EV downturn but electrification is unstoppable. Meta is [obsessed with SiC]( for AR lenses, representing enormous new market for SiC material players. AR lenses use much more material than semiconductors. Meta says very [clearly that SiC]( is their goal for AR lenses. Director of Meta optics, Barry Silverstein is practically begging industry for more SiC in this [Photonics Spectra article]( I have a basket of SiC and GaN stocks focused mainly on SiC materials market leader. I also have been building high performance battery plays but they have optimistic valuations right now. Curious how others are investing in the AR glasses and related optics space. EDIT TO ADD: Thought readers were better informed about AR market growth and it's growing role as AI infrastructure. Meta is reportedly trying to scale production to 20 Million units per year by end of this year. That's 2X more than I phones sold in 2008. According to Gemini: >The Augmented Reality (AR) smart glasses market is experiencing rapid, high-growth, with shipments projected to jump from roughly 850,000 in 2024 to 32 million by 2030, a CAGR of 82.9% in the consumer segment. Driven by AI integration, lightweight designs, and no-display models, the broader market is expected to grow 39.2% in 2025.",

      "selftext": "# DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat. The stock is down over 90% from all time highs in 2021, currently trading at roughly $6 per share with a $10B market cap. The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management, best personified by their hedonistic CEO (Evan Spiegel) who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years, creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune. This, coupled with strong competition from $META, has driven sentiment to perhaps an all-time low. But behind all of this I see, and the data tells me, that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential, currently generating its highest revenue in company history, something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenue-model and the launch of their heavily researched & developed AR Glasses. *Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1...* I have been plotting a $snap long for weeks now, and given the recent sell-off (1-month decline of -30%), I think being long going into earnings offers amazing risk/reward. I will try to concisely summarize my stance: # Snapchat+ Subscriptions: * **The Perfect Rugpull -** Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters. Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025, effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories. The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscription-based revenue and becomes less reliant on ads. Net Profitability will increase: non paying users = less AWS expenses, Paying users = high-margin revenue * **The Data -** Kevory tried compiling [data]( i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications * **My Subscription Forecast -** I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount, as well as users who pay for storage only: |**Quarter**|**Subscribers**|**Other Revenue**|**Analysis**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q1 2025**|**14 Million**|\\~$155M|Shift toward creator-focused features.| |**Q2 2025**|**15 Million**|\\~$170M|Steady organic growth. 9% of total revenue.| |**Q3 2025**|**17 Million**|**$190M**|**Pre-Storage Spike:** Accelerated 35% YoY growth. 12.6% of total revenue.| |**Q4 2025 (Est)**|**19.5M - 20M**|**$245M+**|**The Storage Catalyst:** First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact. Up to 15% of total revenue.| # Spectacles (AR Glasses): * **Launch of market-leading AR Glasses** \\- Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026. Has Spent over $3 Billion in R&D over the past decade. Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem (400k+ developers) and in certain aspects of hardware. * **Superior Balance Sheet -** Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $Snap look superior in the future (less R&D costs), while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META. # Management: There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down: * **SBC (share based compensation) -** historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses. I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential. Things can only get better from here. *Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1...* * **Meta competition -** because of Spiegel’s unwillingness to sell to Meta, Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta. Meta also has in-house datacenters and a more-optimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable. Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU - big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order. Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META. What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitude/approach, stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company, with 90-day mission-cycles and 100x returns. # The Upcoming Earnings: * **Christmas and AI Pump -** Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge. Meta recently beat massively much thanks to ai-driven ad optimization, something I forecast also has helped Snap. Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future. * **Mean reversion -** Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings. Currently -20% on the week. With sentiment being at all time lows, I expect a classic inverse move. |**Quarter**|**Report Date**|**1-Week Pre-Earnings**|**Next Day Reaction**| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Q3 2025**|Nov 5, 2025|**+4.8%**|**+9.7%**| |**Q2 2025**|Aug 5, 2025|**+6.8%**|**-17.2%**| |**Q1 2025**|Apr 29, 2025|**+12.2%**|**-12.4%**| |**Q4 2024**|Feb 4, 2025|**+2.1%**|**-8.4%**| |**Q3 2024**|Oct 29, 2024|**+5.3%**|**-14.1%**| |**Q2 2024**|Aug 1, 2024|**+3.9%**|**-18.3%**| |**Q1 2024**|Apr 25, 2024|**-4.1%**|**+27.6%**| |**Q4 2023**|Feb 6, 2024|**+8.4%**|**-34.6%**| * **Expectations:** Stock is at a 52-week low ($6.00) and priced for a \"double-miss\" disaster. According to my data we will see a massive double beat. Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures, but forecast it to be big. Recent analyst ratings: * Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $9 to $10 on Jan. 30, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $10 to $9 on Jan. 20, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84%. * Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $9.5 to $8.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77%. * Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an Equal-Weight rating and raised the price target from $8.5 to $9.5 on Jan. 13, 2026. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69%. * Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $9 to $8.5 on Dec. 19, 2025. This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71%. In summary, given the current price of snap, I forecast any risk of earnings-centred pullback to be miniscule. I think the market is pricing the stock for a double-miss, the data tells me we are gonna see a double beat. People have the misconception that the company is dying, but my view is contrarian. DAU and revenue is steadily increasing, with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers. # TLDR: * I entered a Long on $SNAP today ahead of earnings (which come after market close) * Market has priced the stock for a double miss. I think we will see a double beat.",

      "selftext_processed": "DD Many of you may be familiar with the storied tale of Snapchat . The stock is down over 90 % from all time highs in 2021 currently trading at roughly $ 6 per share with a $ 10B market cap . The massive decline has largely been caused by incompetent and uninventive management best personified by their hedonistic CEO Evan Spiegel who has paid himself and his buddies massive amounts of share based compensation over the years creating significant dilution and costing shareholders a fortune . This coupled with strong competition from $ META has driven sentiment to perhaps an alltime low . But behind all of this I see and the data tells me that Snapchat is a growing company with great potential currently generating its highest revenue in company history something I foresee to be accentuated with their new revenuemodel and the launch of their heavily researched developed AR Glasses . Processing img q8zaag2ehjhg1 ... I have been plotting a $ snap long for weeks now and given the recent selloff 1month decline of 30 % I think being long going into earnings offers amazing riskreward . I will try to concisely summarize my stance Snapchat Subscriptions The Perfect Rugpull Has had free storage since inception which made it the de facto camera app for youngsters . Introduced a 5GB cap September 2025 effectively forcing their most active users into buying storage in order to save core memories . The implications of this is huge as the company adds a new stream of subscriptionbased revenue and becomes less reliant on ads . Net Profitability will increase non paying users less AWS expenses Paying users highmargin revenue The Data Kevory tried compiling data i think it has slight unintended bias but still shows promising implications My Subscription Forecast I will use logarithmic adoption curve to estimate growth of subcount as well as users who pay for storage only QuarterSubscribersOther RevenueAnalysis Q1 202514 Million $ 155MShift toward creatorfocused features . Q2 202515 Million $ 170MSteady organic growth . 9 % of total revenue . Q3 202517 Million $ 190MPreStorage Spike Accelerated 35 % YoY growth . 12.6 % of total revenue . Q4 2025 Est19.5M 20M $ 245MThe Storage Catalyst First full quarter of the 5GB cap impact . Up to 15 % of total revenue . Spectacles AR Glasses Launch of marketleading AR Glasses Set to launch consumer version of Spectacles 2026 . Has Spent over $ 3 Billion in RD over the past decade . Would estimate them to be ahead of META in terms of ecosystem 400k developers and in certain aspects of hardware . Superior Balance Sheet Separating the endeavour into standalone business will make the balance sheet of $ Snap look superior in the future less RD costs while also facilitating future fund raises to keep competing with META . Management There are 2 main reasons why the stock has been beaten down SBC share based compensation historically has been perfectly aligned with net losses . I believe any future changes to current comp plan could lead to huge upside potential . Things can only get better from here . Processing img jcjvp80jhjhg1 ... Meta competition because of Spiegel ’ s unwillingness to sell to Meta Zuck has over the years just taken everything that made snap unique and added it to Insta . Meta also has inhouse datacenters and a moreoptimized ad machine which helps them be more profitable . Still Meta trades at 170x valuation of snap while only having 8x DAU big mismatch if Snapchat can get things in order . Main goal will be to increase ARPU which needs to grow by 5x to match META . What makes me optimistic is that Spiegel recently has displayed a change in attitudeapproach stating he hopes to revive high growth startup culture within the company with 90day missioncycles and 100x returns . The Upcoming Earnings Christmas and AI Pump Q4 earnings are consistently higher because of holiday surge . Meta recently beat massively much thanks to aidriven ad optimization something I forecast also has helped Snap . Perplexity deal might realign to help with this in future . Mean reversion Has historically almost always inversed trend leading up to earnings . Currently 20 % on the week . With sentiment being at all time lows I expect a classic inverse move . QuarterReport Date1Week PreEarningsNext Day Reaction Q3 2025Nov 5 20254.8 % 9.7 % Q2 2025Aug 5 20256.8 % 17.2 % Q1 2025Apr 29 202512.2 % 12.4 % Q4 2024Feb 4 20252.1 % 8.4 % Q3 2024Oct 29 20245.3 % 14.1 % Q2 2024Aug 1 20243.9 % 18.3 % Q1 2024Apr 25 20244.1 % 27.6 % Q4 2023Feb 6 20248.4 % 34.6 % Expectations Stock is at a 52week low $ 6.00 and priced for a doublemiss disaster . According to my data we will see a massive double beat . Unsure with what explosivity the market will react with when they get the figures but forecast it to be big . Recent analyst ratings Roth Capital analyst Rohit Kulkarni maintained a Neutral rating and raised the price target from $ 9 to $ 10 on Jan. 30 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . UBS analyst Lloyd Walmsley maintained the stock with a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 10 to $ 9 on Jan. 20 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 84 % . Goldman Sachs analyst Eric Sheridan maintained a Neutral rating and slashed the price target from $ 9.5 to $ 8.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 77 % . Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak maintained an EqualWeight rating and raised the price target from $ 8.5 to $ 9.5 on Jan. 13 2026 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 69 % . Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris maintained a Neutral rating and cut the price target from $ 9 to $ 8.5 on Dec. 19 2025 . This analyst has an accuracy rate of 71 % . In summary given the current price of snap I forecast any risk of earningscentred pullback to be miniscule . I think the market is pricing the stock for a doublemiss the data tells me we are gon na see a double beat . People have the misconception that the company is dying but my view is contrarian . DAU and revenue is steadily increasing with better leadership and a successful spectacles launch I think the stock will massively outperform peers . TLDR I entered a Long on $ SNAP today ahead of earnings which come after market close Market has priced the stock for a double miss . I think we will see a double beat ."

      "selftext": "For context I’m 19, have $15k in my ROTH, and the Army is paying for the rest of my school/board. I have no real future costs for the next 5y, as I just paid the $22k the army wouldn’t cover. I have $6k liquid cash, and have been thinking about putting $4k into Microsoft. It’s now reset to its 1-year point, which feels like an incredible opportunity. However, every other tech stock has seemingly tripled. I can’t figure out what that means to me. Does that mean Microsoft is crazy undervalued and will start to skyrocket its recovery in the future? Or does it mean it’s not a smart choice? I know nobody truly knows, but am looking for at least a more experience opinion than mine. There’s also the aspect that if there is a bubble that crashes, if Microsoft wasn’t effected by the up, it wouldn’t be effected by the downs, and I don’t lose my money. On the other hand, if there is no pop, that 4K could have doubled in a couple years in a different company while it remains instead stagnant in Microsoft. Microsoft is nearly down to where it was at times in 2024. Anyways yea just looking for thoughts. Anything is appreciated",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 40 years old and currently invested in Vanguard Target Date Fund 2065 in my 401(k). It’s been a solid “set it and forget it” option, but I’m starting to wonder if it’s too conservative for my actual timeline and goals. I’m planning to retire somewhere in my early to mid‑60s, so realistically I still have 20–25 years of compounding ahead of me. That’s a long runway, and I’m thinking about shifting to a more high‑growth / aggressive allocation while I still can. Here's the URL link of available funds: [**401k Fidelity Available Funds**]( I’m considering building my own allocation instead of sticking with the TDF, something like: \\- Heavy S&P 500 exposure \\- A tilt toward large‑cap growth \\- Maybe a small slice of mid/small caps \\- Minimal or no bonds for now Basically, a more aggressive equity mix that could outperform the TDF over the long haul, with the understanding that I’d rebalance periodically. So, I'm thinking of below. **PROPOSED INVESTMENT:** 60% FXAIX (S&P 500) 20% FSPGX (Large Cap Growth) 10% FSPSX (International Index) 10% FSMDX or RSPYX (Mid or Small Cap) **WHY**: I think it's diversified enough to avoid concentration risk as it keeps the S&P 500 as the core, adds growth, but not overwhelmingly, adds mid/small caps for factor diversification, and keeps a small international slice for global exposure. It's aggressive, but not fragile -- if that makes sense and my opinion. And easy to manage a 4-fund portfolio. Thoughts?",

It ’ s been a solid “ set it and forget it ” option but I ’ m starting to wonder if it ’ s too conservative for my actual timeline and goals . I ’ m planning to retire somewhere in my early to mid‑60s so realistically I still have 20–25 years of compounding ahead of me . That ’ s a long runway and I ’ m thinking about shifting to a more high‑growth aggressive allocation while I still can . Heres the URL link of available funds 401k Fidelity Available Funds I ’ m considering building my own allocation instead of sticking with the TDF something like Heavy SP 500 exposure A tilt toward large‑cap growth Maybe a small slice of midsmall caps Minimal or no_bonds for now Basically a more aggressive equity mix that could outperform the TDF over the long haul with the understanding that I ’ d rebalance periodically . So Im thinking of below . PROPOSED INVESTMENT 60 % FXAIX SP 500 20 % FSPGX Large Cap Growth 10 % FSPSX International Index 10 % FSMDX or RSPYX Mid or Small Cap WHY I think its diversified enough to avoid concentration risk as it keeps the SP 500 as the core adds growth but not_overwhelmingly adds midsmall caps for factor diversification and keeps a small international slice for global exposure . Its aggressive but not_fragile if that makes sense and my opinion . And easy to manage a 4fund portfolio . Thoughts"

      "selftext": "I've heard it all: \"Value Trap, Dying business, Competition\" Let's start from the $310 price it was in 2021. There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high. That puts PayPal close to a $300B valuation with $4B net income. It was trading for 80X earnings. Let's talk about the positives: \\#1. PayPal Bans - Have you heard those stories? People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage. What does this truly mean? This means most of it's revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention. \\#2. Mark Grether - **PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026. I'm getting emails.** The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform. However, PayPal made a huge mistake here not making this the main focus. Who is Mark? Well, in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon. Amazon then took it's ad unit from $10B to $30B in revenue. Uber hired Mark. In 2022 to 2024, Mark took Uber's ad business to $0 to $1B in revenue. What is PayPals Ad Manager? Let's act as if this was my own website. My post will get thousands of clicks but no monetization. Now, with PayPal ads, I can integrate their SDK into my website, and within minutes start running ads on this post. (Not this actual post but if it was my site) This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars. For example, if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $2B revenue at 50% margins, they would go from $5-6B net income, to $6-7B net income, and slowly go higher overtime. This is the setup the stock needs to go $100+ \\#3. PayPal Integrations - People seem to forget, PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal. This means users/businesses all get free advertising to PayPal. No matter what, naturally PayPal will grow for the next 5-10 years. Does it need more social growth? People choosing to actually want it? Yes. As an online business, if I'm not accepting PayPal I'm at a huge disadvantage. People use PayPal for their chargeback protection. I'm confident anytime I buy with PayPal I'm protected. Side Note: PayPal's and Venmo's cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet. **The moat remains in ads. PayPal's entire focus needs to shift to running ads.** **Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years, to sell now, ask yourself, why? PayPal ads release in early 2026. This is the product that will drive growth. We haven't even seen it yet.**",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive heard it all Value Trap Dying business Competition Lets start from the $ 310 price it was in 2021 . There was absolutely zero reason Paypal should have ever traded this high . That puts PayPal close to a $ 300B valuation with $ 4B net income . It was trading for 80X earnings . Lets talk about the positives 1 . PayPal Bans Have you heard those stories People upset PayPal banned them for when they were underage . What does this truly mean This means most of its revenue today is high value and has been fully tested for fraud prevention . 2 . Mark Grether PAYPALS AD MANAGER releases in early 2026 . Im getting emails . The full reason anyone in the last 2 years should have invested in PayPal was due to their ads platform . However PayPal made a huge mistake here not_making this the main focus . Who is Mark Well in 2019 Mark sold his company to Amazon . Amazon then took its ad unit from $ 10B to $ 30B in revenue . Uber hired Mark . In 2022 to 2024 Mark took Ubers ad business to $ 0 to $ 1B in revenue . What is PayPals Ad Manager Lets act as if this was my own website . My post will get thousands of clicks but no_monetization . Now with PayPal ads I can integrate their SDK into my website and within minutes start running ads on this post . Not this actual post but if it was my site This allows for PayPal to get high margin dollars . For example if PayPal can scale their AD unit to $ 2B revenue at 50 % margins they would go from $ 56B net income to $ 67B net income and slowly go higher overtime . This is the setup the stock needs to go $ 100 3 . PayPal Integrations People seem to forget PayPal has spent the last 20 years accepting PayPal . This means usersbusinesses all get free advertising to PayPal . No_matter what naturally PayPal will grow for the next 510 years . Does it need more social growth People choosing to actually want it Yes . As an online business if Im not_accepting PayPal Im at a huge disadvantage . People use PayPal for their chargeback protection . Im confident anytime I buy with PayPal Im protected . Side Note PayPals and Venmos cashback and credit card programs are some of the highest cashback you can get anywhere on the internet . The moat remains in ads . PayPals entire focus needs to shift to running ads . Also if you bought PayPal in the last 2 years to sell now ask yourself why PayPal ads release in early 2026 . This is the product that will drive growth . We havent even seen it yet ."

      "selftext": "Carvana stock has plummeted from its recent $490 high to just $369 as of midday February 5 2026 Many people have never heard Bridgecrest before, and don’t understand why they are the worst human beings on the planet, and how they are associated with Carvana. In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital, Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22% If you have never heard of Bridgecrest before, that is why. Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period. My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse. As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader, I’ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time. The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150,000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax. And he owed $15,800 to Bridgecrest on a $4,000 car. After a short conversation with him, I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap. All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount. After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest, a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff, but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote. This is highly unusual for a bank, as most banks would want to receive the $15,800. They were owed in a timely manner and not have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number. How does this tie in the Carvana stock? Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana, owned through shady, backdoor dealings. And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying. Full disclosure. I am not a financial professional. This is not financial advice. Position disclosure: I have Current open short positions against Carvana. I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock, though it may open and close additional positions at any time.",

In a recent short seller report by Gotham city capital Bridgecrest revealed that they write Car loans at an average interest rate of 22 % If you have never_heard of Bridgecrest before that is why . Only the truly desperate would seek out a car loan that will charge them more then the total price of the car in interest over a five year period . My personal experience with Bridgecrest is even worse . As a 14 year car dealer and a 15 year stock and option trader I ’ ve only run into a Bridgecrest Customer one time . The custoner was driving a 2012 Impala with 150000 miles and three accidents on the Carfax . And he owed $ 15800 to Bridgecrest on a $ 4000 car . After a short conversation with him I determined that we could pull his negative equity into a new vehicle that had huge rebates to cover the gap . All that was left was to call Bridgecrest and confirm the payoff amount . After 28 minutes on hold with Bridgecrest a Bridgecrest representative verbally confirmed the dollar amount of his payoff but refused to give us any form of written or emailed payoff quote . This is highly unusual for a bank as most banks would want to receive the $ 15800 . They were owed in a timely manner and not_have the amount mailed to the wrong address or the wrong account number . How does this tie in the Carvana stock Bridgecrest is the off the books lender for Carvana owned through shady backdoor dealings . And anyone who is invested in Carvana should know the truth about what they are really buying . Full disclosure . I am not_a financial professional . This is not_financial advice . Position disclosure I have Current open short positions against Carvana . I intend to keep betting against Carvana stock though it may open and close additional positions at any time ."

I posted about it here: Back then, people called my investment terrible. Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no government support. But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis. Instead of liquidating everything, I added even more shares. I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce. That day has finally come. I’ve now turned that $40k loss into about +$200k gains including options. I did take profits on my June and $60 Jan calls this morning, but I’m still holding my $35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares. I believe solar is the future, and $ENPH is the leader in this space. I won’t lie, this trade drained me mentally. But days like today make it worth it. I earned this one. Cheers to ENPH shareholders, we deserve this victory today.",

I posted about it here Back then people called my investment terrible . Everyone said solar demand was dead and there was no_government support . But I strongly believed in my thesis and my technical analysis . Instead of liquidating everything I added even more shares . I knew ENPH was setting up for a major bounce . That day has finally come . I ’ ve now turned that $ 40k loss into about $ 200k gains including options . I did take profits on my June and $ 60 Jan calls this morning but I ’ m still holding my $ 35 Jan 2027 calls and my shares . I believe solar is the future and $ ENPH is the leader in this space . I won ’ t lie this trade drained me mentally . But days like today make it worth it . I earned this one . Cheers to ENPH shareholders we deserve this victory today ."

Almost every single one of these stocks, except for GOOG and MU, are significantly down from their 2026 start. We can take away a couple things. 1) reddit sentiment weakens so fast after a couple of red weeks; clearly most retail investors dont have high conviction or do proper diligence. 2) Redditors fail to follow a buying plan, if they had one to begin with, when their favorite stock dips 20-30%. Institutions on the other hand, force selling action on retailers, then buy at their planned price! That’s why they win out. I for one, am buying the stocks I have high conviction on during this dip. I hope yall join me!

      "selftext": "Vindicated? I think so, and if I'm right it means you shouldn't go long in RDDT. In the early 2020s I thought to myself that if RDDT ever got listed I would short it but didn't notice it listed until a year later. I noticed because of headlines about it plummeting under 200. I wrote that I was shocked to see it ever made it that high and that it would go below 100. I profited with an 80$ put to back that up (my first ever experiment with buying contracts.) As we all see RDDT, then surged back over 200 twice. And the fanboys (at least here in reddit) came out in droves. One even saying he steadily profits buying under 200 and selling over 200. Hope he didn't load up again after the third time. At first I asserted the initial decline was because reddit is a shitshow. The [pushback I got there]( was that advertisers on it are making money and that RDDT was only going to grow - hugely (as well as smug and smarmy replies.. as if they wished to confirm the shitshow aspect.) I hadn't researched the advertiser revenue yet, so I did. I can't go through all their balance sheets, but I read enough to learn how that works and it led me to surmise Advertisers can only make an educated guess, throw money at it, and then see how much (if any) new revenue can be tracked to that advertising expense. So I posted that's how the downfall would start; that eventually Advertisers would determine they don't make much from this platform, certainly not enough to keep pouring in good money after bad. Am I right? Certainly not as wrong as the wisecrackers wanted to think. Time always tells the truth. For RDDT I say that will be sooner than later, given Digg and Youtube impacts,such as this article mentions and [the cited analyst in it seems to be seeing what I was predicting](",

      "selftext": "Picked up ENPH Jan 2027 $100 calls back in October when solar was completely hated. Stock had been crushed for months, everyone was calling it dead money, margins were collapsing, demand falling off a cliff, etc. Basically peak pessimism. I’m up about 143% overall now and today alone was a big rip, but I’m still holding. Reason is pretty simple: most of the bad news is already priced in. ENPH went from a market darling to a total punching bag. At \\~$50, you’re looking at a stock that’s been repriced for a worst-case scenario that doesn’t need to reverse much for upside to show up. Solar is extremely rate-sensitive and we’re getting closer to the part of the cycle where rates actually start helping instead of hurting. Even a modest pickup in residential demand changes the narrative fast. ENPH also isn’t some garbage balance sheet company — they’ve got cash, solid tech, and they’ll still be standing when weaker players wash out. Another thing people aren’t really talking about enough is short interest. This name is crowded on the short side. Solar in general is one of the most hated trades out there. If earnings or guidance come in even slightly better than feared, shorts are going to have to cover, and this thing can move way faster than people expect. These are 2027 LEAPS so I’m not trying to time a perfect bottom. If ENPH just mean-reverts part of the way back over the next year or two, the payoff is there. I don’t need it to go back to ATHs for this to work. Not advice, just sharing the trade. Curious if anyone else is still watching solar or thinks this move is just a dead-cat bounce.",

      "selftext": "Figma has 1.5B cash trading at a 10B market cap. They are doing over 1B in revenue. And have around 40% YOY revenue growth 105% customer retention (which means they keep all their customers and add every quarter) CEO has an incentive plan like Elon where he only makes big $$ if the Figma stock price hits certain hurdles. (Like $60,$80, etc) Google bought shares of Figma around $65 a few months ago. Figma also has a AI product called Figma Make. U can try it for free just type Figma Make on google and you are able to just type and create a full website/app. It’s insane and the most impressive AI I’ve probably ever used. The collaborative design market is expected to grow massively over the next 10 years. Around 30% a year on average. Figma has ridiculously high margins that we’ve seen come down from 90s to 80s because they spend so much on AI R&D. But, I’m okay with this. I want them to continue being absolutely cutting edge Collaborative design is the best way to optimize workflow. The ceo can follow the UI/UX designer while the engineer follows and work together in live time which speed up workflow. I think around 90% of the s&p 500 uses Figma. Companies like Google, Netflix, Uber etc all use Figma. Figma is the buy of the century. Holding 29,144 shares at $21.10 This is not financial advise. Just my opinion",

Shares of the company rose nearly 7 % in premarket trading . Lilly last ⁠year became the ‌first pharmaceutical company to hit a $ 1 trillion valuation driven by the ‍popularity of its blockbuster weightloss drug Zepbound and a rapidly expanding obesity market that is shifting ​toward cashpay options and telehealth channels . Lillys ‌upbeat outlook stands in sharp contrast to that of rival Novo Nordisk which has warned of unprecedented price pressures in 2026 after rattling investors with a forecast for a ⁠steep sales drop this ​year . For the reported quarter ​the drugmaker reported a profit of $ 7.54 per share . Analysts were expecting $ 6.67 according ‍to data ⁠compiled by LSEG . Lilly expects to earn $ 33.50 to $ 35 per share on an adjusted basis ⁠this year above analysts average estimate of $ 33.23 per ‌share ."

      "selftext": "My primary concern is government regulations. Could the minimum age regulation have affected them more negatively than anticipated a quarter ago when they sent to investors issuing a warning that they expected Q4 to be affected by government regulations? One more concern: they will join the crowd in saying AI somehow causes a lot of expenses for them. Final concern: they miss on all estimates. The last time the stock traded for less than $6 was in 2018. Back then, they had 188 million daily active users. Most recently they reported 477 million daily users. I say again: $6 for 477 million daily users versus $5 for 188 million daily users EIGHT YEARS ago. For all of 2025, $7 seemed to be the absolute floor. When they reported Q3, the stock surged to $9. No news since then… but now it trades for $6? Little downside - because even if it goes to $5s then I highly anticipate a quick recovery back to $6a. Would $5 be unheard of? As for the past seven years, yes. As for upside - even if it jumps 20 % the stock will merely be back to where it was two weeks ago. Would that be unheard of? Hardly. On a final note I just want to add that I was dead certain PayPal wouldn’t fall more than 5-10 % on earnings but the stock ended up falling 20 %. I held near 3,000 shares and sold yesterday to take a $30k loss. So, don’t take my advice. Call it wishful thinking- but I am 100 % SNAP in my portfolio now. Might be in for a double whammy. Might be in for a quick redemption from yesterday’s PYPL bloodbath.",

      "title": "Why It Feels Like Everyone Is Making Money in Markets (Survivorship Bias)",
      "selftext": "When you look at investing and trading communities, profit posts stand out the most. It can easily feel like everyone is making money. But what we are seeing is already a heavily filtered picture. This is a classic case of survivorship bias. Even if only a small percentage of people actually succeed, that small group is the one that speaks. They post their results, share screenshots, and tell their stories. Those stories get repeated and spread until they start to look like the normal outcome. Meanwhile, most of the people who lost money say nothing. They quietly disappear from the same communities. So the information we see becomes biased toward a small group of survivors. In psychology and behavioral economics, this distortion is called survivorship bias. It is dangerous in markets because it makes people focus on stories instead of outcomes over time. In investing, what matters more than “how much you made” is “how long you stayed in the game.” Once survivorship bias takes hold, people start thinking like this: “That person made several times their money, so maybe I can too.” What we rarely see is how many people tried the same approach, how many failed, or how much of the result was luck rather than skill. As a result, high-risk strategies often look far more attractive than they really are. So what should we look at instead? Not “who made the most money,” but how many people were able to survive using the same method over time. Any strategy can produce a few success stories. The real question is whether it keeps working as time goes on. A slowly growing account contains far more information than one that rose quickly. And the more desperate someone feels, the easier it is to fall into this bias. The more urgently you want results, the more your attention is drawn to extreme success stories. At moments like this, you should be more careful and more cautious, not more aggressive. When you invest in a rush, emotion takes the lead, and the result often ends in ruin. So when you feel pressured to hurry, the important question is not how much you can make, but how long you can last. Before thinking, “Maybe I can be the next success story,” it may be more realistic to ask: “How many people actually stayed in the game using this approach?”",

      "selftext_processed": "When you look at investing and trading communities profit posts stand out the most . It can easily feel like everyone is making money . But what we are seeing is already a heavily filtered picture . This is a classic case of survivorship bias . Even if only a small percentage of people actually succeed that small group is the one that speaks . They post their results share screenshots and tell their stories . Those stories get repeated and spread until they start to look like the normal outcome . Meanwhile most of the people who lost money say nothing_They quietly disappear from the same communities . So the information we see becomes biased toward a small group of survivors . In psychology and behavioral economics this distortion is called survivorship bias . It is dangerous in markets because it makes people focus on stories instead of outcomes over time . In investing what matters more than “ how much you made ” is “ how long you stayed in the game. ” Once survivorship bias takes hold people start thinking like this “ That person made several times their money so maybe I can too. ” What we rarely see is how many people tried the same approach how many failed or how much of the result was luck rather than skill . As a result highrisk strategies often look far more attractive than they really are . So what should we look at instead Not_ “ who made the most money ” but how many people were able to survive using the same method over time . Any strategy can produce a few success stories . The real question is whether it keeps working as time goes on . A slowly growing account contains far more information than one that rose quickly . And the more desperate someone feels the easier it is to fall into this bias . The more urgently you want results the more your attention is drawn to extreme success stories . At moments like this you should be more careful and more cautious not_more aggressive . When you invest in a rush emotion takes the lead and the result often ends in ruin . So when you feel pressured to hurry the important question is not_how much you can make but how long you can last . Before thinking “ Maybe I can be the next success story ” it may be more realistic to ask “ How many people actually stayed in the game using this approach ”"

      "title": "Why I'm Betting (Relatively) Big on IPOs This Year - DD?",
      "selftext": "We've all heard of the massive IPOs due (hopefully) sometime this year, and with all the recent/accumulated hype around AI/SpaceTech companies, I think we should follow where the smart money goes. First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund, **Founders Fund:** They have major holdings/stakes in both **OpenAI** and notably **SpaceX,** with a massive **$1B** investment in late 2025 into **OpenAI** and total investments upwards of **$600-$700M** in **SpaceX,** which alone is worth over **$80 billion** as of today, and considering the fund has an **AUM** of **$17 billion** and **total realized/unrealized portfolio** of **\\~$200 billion,** a conservative estimate IPO of **$1.5T** will likely more than double their unrealized stake in **SpaceX** and combined with **OpenAI's** IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund. Now I'll mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated won't be a part of: **Anthropic. Co:** Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI, I think you all know **Anthropic** has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO, you cannot miss out on this one. Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion, **Low-risk/High-return Tickers** that directly stand to gain from the IPOs: 1. $SATS - SpaceX With around **45-50%** of their mkt cap in **SpaceX** shares, roughly **$10\\~$11B,** this ticker stands to gain the most from the **SpaceX** IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV, all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into **$DTECH** or **$RKLB.** 2. $MSFT - OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock, but it's all about to change for the better (for calls) in 2026. I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of \\~$540 and all I can see is **unlimited upside at a 23% discount.** With an **absurd 27% ownership stake in OpenAI,** even if Altman shit himself on live tv you'll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up. 3. $SKM - Anthropic If you want exposure to **Anthropic. Co,** look no further than **$SKM**, a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry, merely a subdivision of their parent company SK, one of the country's largest chaebols. With a dominance of **50.5 of all shares** in their local market, **$SKM** is a solid investment even without their major stakes in **Anthropic. Co.** A monopoly in their industry at a relative all-time low is a great investment nonetheless, but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings. **They hold an ownership stake of approximately** **0.58%\\~0.7%,** which may not seem like a lot, but relative to their **\\~$9B mkt cap**, it makes up a significant portion of **$SKM's valuation at around 20%-25% of the company.** They've also got a joint partnership with **Anthropic,** together developing a **Multilingual LLM** tailored for the telecommunications industry. The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on, and the general public knows little to nothing about **Anthropic or their projects with SKM**, so we are early investors here. And, if you look at their Ytd/1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming. my current positions are: $SATS: +1 contracts of $9.80 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $160 $MSFT: +2 contracts of $4.90 ac Expiry - 11/20 pt $600 $SKM: +5 contracts of $1.89 ac Expiry - 9/18 pt $41 **Tldr; If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no downside risk load up on $sats, $msft, $skm;** **Calls, don't be a pussy**",

      "selftext_processed": "Weve all heard of the massive IPOs due hopefully sometime this year and with all the recentaccumulated hype around AISpaceTech companies I think we should follow where the smart money goes . First point is the GOAT Peter thiel and his venture capital fund Founders Fund They have major holdingsstakes in both OpenAI and notably SpaceX with a massive $ 1B investment in late 2025 into OpenAI and total investments upwards of $ 600 $ 700M in SpaceX which alone is worth over $ 80 billion as of today and considering the fund has an AUM of $ 17 billion and total realizedunrealized portfolio of $ 200 billion a conservative estimate IPO of $ 1.5T will likely more than double their unrealized stake in SpaceX and combined with OpenAIs IPO could double the paper gains of the entire fund . Now Ill mention the IPO that peter and his fund explicitly stated wont be a part of Anthropic . Co Honestly tired of paraphrasing articles and AI I think you all know Anthropic has the most hype and sentiment towards IPO you can not miss out on this one . Now this is all just a segway into the core of the onion LowriskHighreturn Tickers that directly stand to gain from the IPOs 1 . $ SATS SpaceX With around 4550 % of their mkt cap in SpaceX shares roughly $ 10 $ 11B this ticker stands to gain the most from the SpaceX IPO and the following periods of insanely high IV all without the premiums you would have to pay to get into $ DTECH or $ RKLB . 2 . $ MSFT OpenAI The past 6 months have been looking rough for this stock but its all about to change for the better for calls in 2026 . I look at this Mag 7 stock fallen from previous highs of $ 540 and all I can see is unlimited upside at a 23 % discount . With an absurd 27 % ownership stake in OpenAI even if Altman shit himself on live tv youll be able to sleep well at night knowing it can only go up . 3 . $ SKM Anthropic If you want exposure to Anthropic . Co look no_further than $ SKM a South Korean giant conglomerate in the Wireless Telecommunication industry merely a subdivision of their parent company SK one of the countrys largest chaebols . With a dominance of 50.5 of all shares in their local market $ SKM is a solid investment even without their major stakes in Anthropic . Co. A monopoly in their industry at a relative alltime low is a great investment nonetheless but things really start to take off when we look at their holdings . They hold an ownership stake of approximately 0.58 % 0.7 % which may not_seem like a lot but relative to their $ 9B mkt cap it makes up a significant portion of $ SKMs valuation at around 20 % 25 % of the company . Theyve also got a joint partnership with Anthropic together developing a Multilingual LLM tailored for the telecommunications industry . The Koreans are pretty slow to catch on and the general public knows little to nothing_about Anthropic or their projects with SKM so we are early investors here . And if you look at their Ytd1Yr chart you can see a clear uptrend forming . my current positions are $ SATS 1 contracts of $ 9.80 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 160 $ MSFT 2 contracts of $ 4.90 ac Expiry 1120 pt $ 600 $ SKM 5 contracts of $ 1.89 ac Expiry 918 pt $ 41 Tldr If you want HUGE upside potential with little to no_downside risk load up on $ sats $ msft $ skm Calls dont be a pussy"

      "selftext": "Ok. Let's think about this logically. Wallstreet hammers SaaS companies. They think it's now much easier to create software. A team of 10 software engineers can now do the work of 100 software engineers. This makes SaaS moats easier to break. You can recreate most of the value of a SaaS with a small team of developers. Competition for SaaS will be intense in the coming years and pricing power for SaaS will be eroded. I happen to agree with that. I'm a software engineer and the productivity gain I experienced in the last 5 months is nothing short of scary good. I personally wouldn't invest in any SaaS company right now. I'm not saying SaaS has no value anymore. I'm saying they should no longer command the high PE ratios that they have historically enjoyed over the broader market. Ok so if SaaS companies are getting hammered, surely it will rotate to the companies responsible for getting the SaaS companies hammered, right? The companies who profit must be the ones who are making AI chips, data centers, and providing energy. Right? Nope. TSMC hammered. Nvidia hammered. Amazon (AWS) hammered. Broadcom hammered. This doesn't make any sense. Buy the dip on hardware companies if you think SaaS company moats will break easily caused by AI.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ok . Lets think about this logically . Wallstreet hammers SaaS companies . They think its now much easier to create software . A team of 10 software engineers can now do the work of 100 software engineers . This makes SaaS moats easier to break . You can recreate most of the value of a SaaS with a small team of developers . Competition for SaaS will be intense in the coming years and pricing power for SaaS will be eroded . I happen to agree with that . Im a software engineer and the productivity gain I experienced in the last 5 months is nothing_short of scary good . I personally wouldnt invest in any SaaS company right now . Im not_saying SaaS has no_value anymore . Im saying they should no_longer command the high PE ratios that they have historically enjoyed over the broader market . Ok so if SaaS companies are getting hammered surely it will rotate to the companies responsible for getting the SaaS companies hammered right The companies who profit must be the ones who are making AI chips data centers and providing energy . Right Nope . TSMC hammered . Nvidia hammered . Amazon AWS hammered . Broadcom hammered . This doesnt make any sense . Buy the dip on hardware companies if you think SaaS company moats will break easily caused by AI ."

      "selftext": "I know, I know. \"Catching a falling knife.\" I bought in at **$58**, so looking at the ticker today at **$42** (-20% drop) stings. The earnings were ugly: Revenue missed, branded checkout slowed to a crawl, and the guidance was flat. But the market is panic-selling the headline and missing the actual story: **The Board just brought in a \"Shareholder Return\" mercenary.** **1. The \"Alex Chriss\" Era is Over** Alex Chriss is out. The board appointed **Enrique Lores** (effective March 1), the former CEO of HP. Why does this matter? At HP, Lores wasn't a \"growth at all costs\" guy. He was a financial engineer who aggressively used free cash flow to buy back stock. The Board didn't hire him to invent a new button; they hired him to engineer the EPS. **2. The \"Death Spiral\" Stress Test** I updated my valuation model this morning to be brutally honest. I removed all the analyst \"growth\" fluff. I assumed PayPal is a melting ice cube. I modeled revenue and earnings **shrinking -5% every year** forever. **The Math at $42/share:** * **Free Cash Flow Yield:** \\~11-12% (based on \\~$6B FCF). * **The \"Cannibal\" Effect:** If the business shrinks 5%, but they use that massive cash pile to buy back stock at these depressed prices, they can retire \\~10-12% of the float per year. **The Equation:** 12% Buyback Yield - 5% Business Decay = **+7% Growth Per Share.** You are mathematically winning even if the company is losing. That is the safety margin at 8.5x earnings. **3. The Verdict** This isn't a growth stock anymore. It’s a \"Cannibal\" stock. The market is pricing it like it's going bankrupt (0.2x Debt/EBITDA says otherwise). With a new CEO known for discipline and a double-digit FCF yield, I think this is maximum pessimism. **My Move:** I’m not selling my $58 bag. I’m lowering my cost basis. The business might be stagnant, but at $42, the math is too loud to ignore. **Positions:** Long PYPL (Avg $58).",

The earnings were ugly Revenue missed branded checkout slowed to a crawl and the guidance was flat . But the market is panicselling the headline and missing the actual story The Board just brought in a Shareholder Return mercenary . 1 . The Alex Chriss Era is Over Alex Chriss is out . The board appointed Enrique Lores effective March 1 the former CEO of HP . Why does this matter At HP Lores wasnt a growth at all costs guy . He was a financial engineer who aggressively used free cash flow to buy back stock . The Board didnt hire him to invent a new button they hired him to engineer the EPS . 2 . The Death Spiral Stress Test I updated my valuation model this morning to be brutally honest . I removed all the analyst growth fluff . I assumed PayPal is a melting ice cube . I modeled revenue and earnings shrinking 5 % every year forever . The Math at $ 42share Free Cash Flow Yield 1112 % based on $ 6B FCF . The Cannibal Effect If the business shrinks 5 % but they use that massive cash pile to buy back stock at these depressed prices they can retire 1012 % of the float per year . The Equation 12 % Buyback Yield 5 % Business Decay 7 % Growth Per Share . You are mathematically winning even if the company is losing . That is the safety margin at 8.5x earnings . 3 . The Verdict This isnt a growth stock anymore . It ’ s a Cannibal stock . The market is pricing it like its going bankrupt 0.2x DebtEBITDA says otherwise . With a new CEO known for discipline and a doubledigit FCF yield I think this is maximum pessimism . My Move I ’ m not_selling my $ 58 bag . I ’ m lowering my cost basis . The business might be stagnant but at $ 42 the math is too loud to ignore . Positions Long PYPL Avg $ 58 ."

      "selftext": "Been digging into this one since the S-1 (link [here]( dropped and wanted to share my notes for the upcoming IPO this week. They make electrical distribution equipment - transformers, switchgear, PDUs, power skids, the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers. Not sexy but completely essential. Every data center, every utility substation, every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff. FY25 revenue: $753M (up 56% YoY) Adjusted EBITDA: $169M (22.5% margin) Adjusted net income: $88.7M Backlog: $1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $283M revenue which is 84% growth. The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility. One thing I noticed - they lead with adjusted figures everywhere. GAAP net income isn't prominently disclosed which usually means there's a meaningful gap. They're adjusting out amortization from acquisitions, sponsor fees, integration costs, stock comp, etc. The adjustments are defensible given the situation but I'd like to see full GAAP figures. This is a PE roll-up. Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024: MGM Transformer (Oct 2023) PwrQ (March 2024) States Manufacturing (May 2024) VanTran (June 2024) So they've been operating as a combined entity for less than two years. Revenue breakdown: Data centers: 42% Grid/utilities: 23% Industrial: 19% Other: 16% By product type: Custom/engineered-to-order: 91% Standard products: 5% Services: 4% The custom work is where the margins are. They're not competing on price with commodity stuff. Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this, their largest comparable and another power infra company. He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv. That's probably the most relevant experience you could ask for - he's literally done this before with a similar business. CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment ($12B+ in revenue). So the management bench is legitimately experienced. As mentioned above, Vertiv is the big dog in data center power/cooling infrastructure, currently trading around $135 with a $50B+ market cap. Pros: * AI buildout, grid modernization, manufacturing reshoring - all of this requires electrical equipment * Supply constrained market. Lead times for this stuff can be 2-4 years from some suppliers. Forgent claims their lead times are 30-65% shorter than industry average * Capacity expansion almost done. They've invested $205M to expand manufacturing, should support up to $5B in revenue without major additional capex * Management knows the space Cons: * This is a PE exit. 70% of the IPO is secondary (existing shareholders cashing out). Only 30% is primary shares with proceeds going to the company. Neos wants liquidity. * Roll-up risk. Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity. Less than 2 years of operating history together. * Valuation is rich for what's essentially a bet that the pieces fit together * Data center exposure cuts both ways. If AI capex slows down they're exposed.",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into this one since the S1 link here dropped and wanted to share my notes for the upcoming IPO this week . They make electrical distribution equipment transformers switchgear PDUs power skids the stuff that moves electricity from the grid to your servers . Not_sexy but completely essential . Every data center every utility substation every big manufacturing plant needs this stuff . FY25 revenue $ 753M up 56 % YoY Adjusted EBITDA $ 169M 22.5 % margin Adjusted net income $ 88.7M Backlog $ 1.03B as of Sept 2025 Q1 FY26 came in at $ 283M revenue which is 84 % growth . The backlog being larger than full year revenue gives decent visibility . One thing I noticed they lead with adjusted figures everywhere . GAAP net income isnt prominently disclosed which usually means theres a meaningful gap . Theyre adjusting out amortization from acquisitions sponsor fees integration costs stock comp etc . The adjustments are defensible given the situation but Id like to see full GAAP figures . This is a PE rollup . Neos Partners bought four separate companies between Oct 2023 and June 2024 MGM Transformer Oct 2023 PwrQ March 2024 States Manufacturing May 2024 VanTran June 2024 So theyve been operating as a combined entity for less than two years . Revenue breakdown Data centers 42 % Gridutilities 23 % Industrial 19 % Other 16 % By product type Customengineeredtoorder 91 % Standard products 5 % Services 4 % The custom work is where the margins are . Theyre not_competing on price with commodity stuff . Their CEO is Gary Niederpruem who was at Vertiv before this their largest comparable and another power infra company . He was part of the leadership team that carved Emerson Network Power out of Emerson Electric and turned it into Vertiv . Thats probably the most relevant experience you could ask for hes literally done this before with a similar business . CFO Ryan Fiedler came from Caterpillar where he was CFO of their Resource Industries segment $ 12B in revenue . So the management bench is legitimately experienced . As mentioned above Vertiv is the big dog in data center powercooling infrastructure currently trading around $ 135 with a $ 50B market cap . Pros AI buildout grid modernization manufacturing reshoring all of this requires electrical equipment Supply constrained market . Lead times for this stuff can be 24 years from some suppliers . Forgent claims their lead times are 3065 % shorter than industry average Capacity expansion almost done . Theyve invested $ 205M to expand manufacturing should support up to $ 5B in revenue without major additional capex Management knows the space Cons This is a PE exit . 70 % of the IPO is secondary existing shareholders cashing out . Only 30 % is primary shares with proceeds going to the company . Neos wants liquidity . Rollup risk . Four acquisitions in 8 months is aggressive and its unproven as a combined entity . Less than 2 years of operating history together . Valuation is rich for whats essentially a bet that the pieces fit together Data center exposure cuts both ways . If AI capex slows down theyre exposed ."

      "selftext": "Currently, VOO makes up the largest position in my portfolio. However, I'm a non-American investing from outside, and I'm losing confidence in the US for obvious reasons. From an ethical standpoint, I also don't feel like continuing to invest in American companies when America is actively threatening and bullying other countries, including my own. Why should I contribute to an economy that is causing so much harm not only to itself but also the rest of the world? As I'm not a US citizen and have zero ties to the US, I'm thinking now might be a good time to sell all my VOO shares and convert them to VXUS instead, since I see international markets outperforming the US for at least the next few years. I don't have to pay capital gains where I live, so tax is a non-issue for me. Would it be OK to just go all-in on VXUS, or is this a bad idea?",

So with that said do you feel the stock has more room to rise even as other sectors like software, semi conductors dip? Do you consider it a safe haven in this turmoil? They are tied to AI with their routers and switches so it’s not as much of a dinosaur as people think?

One of the faces for the high flying stocks was Cisco the networking giant which had the highest market valuation in the world a month before if I remember correctly . Today it passed its dot com bubble high ironically on a day where Nasdaq faltered . So with that said do you feel the stock has more room to rise even as other sectors like software semi conductors dip Do you consider it a safe haven in this turmoil They are tied to AI with their routers and switches so it ’ s not_as much of a dinosaur as people think Obviously I don ’ t see the upside of other AI centric companies but the floor maybe way more sturdier ."

      "selftext": "I've been looking on with interest at a bunch of SaaS stocks for a while now (Constellation, Intuit, Atlassian, Toast, Salesforce) as they fell on the 'AI will kill every SaaS company' narrative starting to gain momentum. I think it's safe to say that that whole 'SaaS extinction event' narrative has basically gone from 'scary idea' to 'accepted wisdom' by the market at this point given the magnitude of the moves today after Anthropic dropped their latest tool and everyone freaked out. I'm not saying that's right, the markets frequently get it wrong, just commenting on the price moves. I'm trying to figure out what to do here. Option A would be begin to buy these SaaS companies that have large customer bases, recurring revenue and a long history. Doing that sort of requires a belief that they'll integrate AI into their products 'on the run' while fending of the 'pure' AI companies and their abilities. They might fall more in the next months / years so doing this also would require a fair bit of patience and ability to tolerate that pain. Option B would be to not buy at all, continue to watch as the market sorts out the winners and losers. This would be based on a belief that AI is actually going to cause most of these companies to either lose a bunch of users or that it will compress their margins so far that they'll become unattractive investments but that it's impossible to tell which at this point. Option C would be to wait on the 'AI bubble' popping because if that happens, all tech will be indiscriminately sold down (whether it's AI or SaaS) for a while. Doing that means a belief that the AI capabilities of the AI companies are overstated and that the SaaS companies will be fine in the long term as they integrate the helpful AI tools and keep their users. I have no idea on whether that's true or not (and no one else really seems to either, but the moves today seem to suggest there's more in the 'AI will change everything' camp than the 'AI is a bubble one'). Edit: Woah, this has blown up and there's some insanely good takes in the comments from people actually in the industry and stuff. I might expand the post and then incorporate the best of the feedback and format it properly then post the whole deep dive to my profile (probs too long for a sub post) so feel free to follow there if you want to see it.",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been looking on with interest at a bunch of SaaS stocks for a while now Constellation Intuit Atlassian Toast Salesforce as they fell on the AI will kill every SaaS company narrative starting to gain momentum . I think its safe to say that that whole SaaS extinction event narrative has basically gone from scary idea to accepted wisdom by the market at this point given the magnitude of the moves today after Anthropic dropped their latest tool and everyone freaked out . Im not_saying thats right the markets frequently get it wrong just commenting on the price moves . Im trying to figure out what to do here . Option A would be begin to buy these SaaS companies that have large customer bases recurring revenue and a long history . Doing that sort of requires a belief that theyll integrate AI into their products on the run while fending of the pure AI companies and their abilities . They might fall more in the next months years so doing this also would require a fair bit of patience and ability to tolerate that pain . Option B would be to not_buy at all continue to watch as the market sorts out the winners and losers . This would be based on a belief that AI is actually going to cause most of these companies to either lose a bunch of users or that it will compress their margins so far that theyll become unattractive investments but that its impossible to tell which at this point . Option C would be to wait on the AI bubble popping because if that happens all tech will be indiscriminately sold down whether its AI or SaaS for a while . Doing that means a belief that the AI capabilities of the AI companies are overstated and that the SaaS companies will be fine in the long term as they integrate the helpful AI tools and keep their users . I have no_idea on whether thats true or not_and no_one else really seems to either but the moves today seem to suggest theres more in the AI will change everything camp than the AI is a bubble one . Edit Woah this has blown up and theres some insanely good takes in the comments from people actually in the industry and stuff . I might expand the post and then incorporate the best of the feedback and format it properly then post the whole deep dive to my profile probs too long for a sub post so feel free to follow there if you want to see it ."

      "selftext": "In a reply to this recently top upvoted post: OP here is complaining about how volatile stocks are, but he's only talking about downside volatility. Of course if you asked him a few months or weeks ago how his portfolio was doing, he'd say that he was doing well and imply that he's a genius because of his picks. But when the market and individual stock picks fall, he's now complaining about how \"rigged\" it all is. My man, you weren't complaining when stocks were ripping up since 2018 when you started investing, how unusual there is no longer any real price discovery because of all the excess liquidity in the system? You never thought that when your tech stock goes up 15% for almost no reason, that that's somehow not \"rigged\" in the same way when it also marches down 15%? Stocks go up and down. If you cannot stomach the volatility, you can buy bank CDs and forget about your brokerage account. Those yield a nice 4% per year and never have any drawdown in nominal terms. For anyone invested in equities, you need to stomach the risk that stocks often go on random walks, they go up and down. Sometimes they go way down. Perhaps individual stock picking isn't for you if you cannot stomach the recent volatility in a very crowded trade (e.g., long tech stocks).",

Of course if you asked him a few months or weeks ago how his portfolio was doing hed say that he was doing well and imply that hes a genius because of his picks . But when the market and individual stock picks fall hes now complaining about how rigged it all is . My man you werent complaining when stocks were ripping up since 2018 when you started investing how unusual there is no_longer any real price discovery because of all the excess liquidity in the system You never_thought that when your tech stock goes up 15 % for almost no_reason that thats somehow not_rigged in the same way when it also marches down 15 % Stocks go up and down . If you can not stomach the volatility you can buy bank CDs and forget about your brokerage account . Those yield a nice 4 % per year and never_have any drawdown in nominal terms . For anyone invested in equities you need to stomach the risk that stocks often go on random walks they go up and down . Sometimes they go way down . Perhaps individual stock picking isnt for you if you can not stomach the recent volatility in a very crowded trade e.g . long tech stocks ."

      "title": "When Coinbase Grows, It Doesn’t Make A Sound",
      "selftext": "Watching valuation shocks to Coinbase is a painful one, and NOTHING looks good. Coinbase is in a regulatory mire, embattled with lackluster revenue growth, a model based on the pricing performance of crypto and crypto relevancy. None Of that reads the same as the ‘free and infinite possibility‘ type of growth story we’ve seen with tech companies of 2015 to now. Disclaimer: This is not a post to defend their valuation or try to determine where fair value currently sits. After doing a few scenario tests, it does appear their valuation has room to plummet further. And those valuations are rooted in my conservative assumptions. That said, crypto itself can randomly regain volume and excitement once more, but this has proven to be an unstable underpinning for $COIN’s growth proposition. This is why the focus of coinbase has dead reckoned towards palatable regulatory framework and stable source of recurring revenue. So, that’s the good news. Coinbase is not the typical tech company in how perceived itself. They’re a realist. They know their story is a quiet one and their innovation is not publicly visible. Since their IPO, they’ve had several missed opportunities to capture the excitement the rest of the tech leaders have taken advantage of. Their relevancy is also slightly fading with crypto volumes persisting downward. I applaud them for recognizing all of that. Here‘a where I think bad can be good: fewer distractions from resting on a revenue model destined to wax and wane like the lunar cycle, with far less predictability. This forces their executive leadership to stay focused on a course that makes them meaningfully needed and to create moats that align with efficiency and regulatory conformity. This is a large part of the reason why they contest elements of the Clarity Act - which doesn’t give them the full expression of where they find their stablecoins to be most useful. Let‘s skip ahead and talk about the things they are doing right: They are outfitted with the right people with correct tone for making their case to regulatory bodies. They don’t speak like innovators. They’re speaking like bankers. Lawmakers like that. It’s dry, boring and (somewhat) comprehensible. They’re also making the right arguments to the current regime: ”We support dollar dominance globally by offering a platform denominated in the USD stablecoin and subsequent staking rewards” and “We are an American-born company on the leading edge of blockchain‘s global adoption”. That’s also language that remains party neutral, a durable good, if you will. As for their revenue mission, they’re the infrastructure for institutional involvement in crypto. Their next evolution is already happening as they strive to be the base for efficient rules-based exchange. This can encompass so many things…contracts, ownership stakes, pay arrangements, record keeping, KYC; all of which have highly universal applications. This isn’t a huge revenue bump felt immediately but an accumulation that will make their revenue stickier and more predictable with time. A few other revenue streams worth noting that are within reach: compliance and authorization as a service, prime brokerage services, merchant/stablecoin infrastructure and processing, treasury services, tokenized private investments (funds, LP models, DPPs), international exchange developments that programmatically adopt the host-nations regulatory framework. None of these areas are a stretch, but I also want to leave a disclaimer that none of them would massively drive revenue growth in a single year. I would liken coinbase to the JP Morgan Chase of exchanges. Slow to pivot but fundamentally sound in directive. Their primary mission is to be the exchange first. Everything that comes after is a value add and a potential business unit developed over time either organically or by acquisition. So, that’s my proclamation here. Great things are very possible, but the company is a bet on your own patience. What makes the story of Coinbase unique is their generally positive perception from institutions, enterprises and government. There’s really not a lot of ground they need to cover reputation-wise; just stay the course. And an overlooked positive is that because they are in the business of money itself, they can capture inflation spikes on their top line. Greater money velocity and supply can be more directly fed into their revenue model without the burden of recognizing cost constraints beforehand. This is very different from your COGS-heavy profit margins. My point for writing this post is to inform investors that Coinbase is one hell of a force. This doesn’t mean by 2030 we should expect a valuations to exceed $1T or higher, but there’s a roadway and it’s built on stone rather than a mirage across sands. Value the business accordingly.",

      "selftext_processed": "Watching valuation shocks to Coinbase is a painful one and NOTHING_looks good . Coinbase is in a regulatory mire embattled with lackluster revenue growth a model based on the pricing performance of crypto and crypto relevancy . None Of that reads the same as the ‘ free and infinite possibility ‘ type of growth story we ’ ve seen with tech companies of 2015 to now . Disclaimer This is not_a post to defend their valuation or try to determine where fair value currently sits . After doing a few scenario tests it does appear their valuation has room to plummet further . And those valuations are rooted in my conservative assumptions . That said crypto itself can randomly regain volume and excitement once more but this has proven to be an unstable underpinning for $ COIN ’ s growth proposition . This is why the focus of coinbase has dead reckoned towards palatable regulatory framework and stable source of recurring revenue . So that ’ s the good news . Coinbase is not_the typical tech company in how perceived itself . They ’ re a realist . They know their story is a quiet one and their innovation is not_publicly visible . Since their IPO they ’ ve had several missed opportunities to capture the excitement the rest of the tech leaders have taken advantage of . Their relevancy is also slightly fading with crypto volumes persisting downward . I applaud them for recognizing all of that . Here ‘ a where I think bad can be good fewer distractions from resting on a revenue model destined to wax and wane like the lunar cycle with far less predictability . This forces their executive leadership to stay focused on a course that makes them meaningfully needed and to create moats that align with efficiency and regulatory conformity . This is a large part of the reason why they contest elements of the Clarity Act which doesn ’ t give them the full expression of where they find their stablecoins to be most useful . Let ‘ s skip ahead and talk about the things they are doing right They are outfitted with the right people with correct tone for making their case to regulatory bodies . They don ’ t speak like innovators . They ’ re speaking like bankers . Lawmakers like that . It ’ s dry boring and somewhat comprehensible . They ’ re also making the right arguments to the current regime ” We support dollar dominance globally by offering a platform denominated in the USD stablecoin and subsequent staking rewards ” and “ We are an Americanborn company on the leading edge of blockchain ‘ s global adoption ” . That ’ s also language that remains party neutral a durable good if you will . As for their revenue mission they ’ re the infrastructure for institutional involvement in crypto . Their next evolution is already happening as they strive to be the base for efficient rulesbased exchange . This can encompass so many things…contracts ownership stakes pay arrangements record keeping KYC all of which have highly universal applications . This isn ’ t a huge revenue bump felt immediately but an accumulation that will make their revenue stickier and more predictable with time . A few other revenue streams worth noting that are within reach compliance and authorization as a service prime brokerage services merchantstablecoin infrastructure and processing treasury services tokenized private investments funds LP models DPPs international exchange developments that programmatically adopt the hostnations regulatory framework . None of these areas are a stretch but I also want to leave a disclaimer that none of them would massively drive revenue growth in a single year . I would liken coinbase to the JP Morgan Chase of exchanges . Slow to pivot but fundamentally sound in directive . Their primary mission is to be the exchange first . Everything that comes after is a value add and a potential business unit developed over time either organically or by acquisition . So that ’ s my proclamation here . Great things are very possible but the company is a bet on your own patience . What makes the story of Coinbase unique is their generally positive perception from institutions enterprises and government . There ’ s really not_a lot of ground they need to cover reputationwise just stay the course . And an overlooked positive is that because they are in the business of money itself they can capture inflation spikes on their top line . Greater money velocity and supply can be more directly fed into their revenue model without the burden of recognizing cost constraints beforehand . This is very different from your COGSheavy profit margins . My point for writing this post is to inform investors that Coinbase is one hell of a force . This doesn ’ t mean by 2030 we should expect a valuations to exceed $ 1T or higher but there ’ s a roadway and it ’ s built on stone rather than a mirage across sands . Value the business accordingly ."

      "selftext": "For the last decade, the mantra has been \"Software is eating the world.\" But as we enter 2026, the power dynamic has fundamentally shifted. While the world's focus remains on the \"ghost in the machine\" - the in AI, the algorithms, and the code - the real leverage has migrated back to the Physical Bits: the critical atoms that make the digital revolution possible. My investment thesis is built on three pillars of Scarcity, Energy, and Sovereignty: **1. The Energy Chokepoint (Uranium)** AI is the most energy-intensive technology in human history. We have reached a point where \"code\" is limited by \"current.\" You cannot run a global intelligence network on intermittent power; it requires the massive, carbon-free energy density that only Uranium can provide. By holding CCJ and UUUU, I am investing in the \"fuel\" for the AI era. In this hierarchy, the uranium atom is the ultimate \"bit\" of data center uptime. **2. The Kinetic Chokepoint (Rare Earths)** Software can think, but it cannot move without Rare Earth Elements (REEs). From the high-performance magnets in EV motors to the actuators in humanoid robotics, NdPr (Neodymium-Praseodymium) is the non-substitutable hardware that translates digital commands into physical motion. Through MP and LYSDY, I am positioned at the bottleneck of the \"Physical AI\" revolution. **3. The Geopolitical Moat** We are moving from a world of \"just-in-time\" globalism to a world of \"friend-shoring\" and resource nationalism. The value of these minerals is no longer just their market price; it is their provenance. By focusing on Western-aligned supply chains, I am betting on a \"Sovereignty Premium\" - the reality that a pound of uranium or a magnet produced in a secure, allied jurisdiction is worth significantly more than one controlled by a geopolitical rival. **The Bottom Line** In a world of infinite, replicable software, value naturally flows toward the finite and the non-substitutable. I will not invest in the companies that write the code, instead I’m choosing to invest in the companies that control the physical gatekeepers of the modern world. Tldr: I am long on the atoms that power the bits.",

The ‌Danish drugmaker said it expects sales to drop between 5 % and 13 % ‍this year compared with analysts average expectation of a 2 % decline . Its U.S.listed shares fell 13.8 % to $ 50.83 . Wegovymaker ​Novo also reported a 14 % fall in ‌fourthquarter operating profit to 31.7 billion Danish crowns slightly above the estimate of 31.2 billion crowns . The selloff comes as Wall Street is reassessing longheld expectations that the obesity drug market could ⁠hit $ 150 billion early next decade ​as U.S. prices for GLP1 ​treatments from Novo and Lilly fall sharply and competition intensifies in the cashpay ‍consumer market .

      "selftext": "I am trying to understand whether my strategy is correct as a two-year investor. I usualy open positions in stocks whose financials seem quite good to me, companies that are growing at a fairly good pace, but the momentum is negative and the stock price is falling, such as Google (at 150) or Amazon, which have brought me quite good profits. However, in general, I have not been very successful, as many times when investing in falling knives, I have found myself trapped (for example, Novo Nordisk). I thought I had entered at a good point, as it had fallen quite a bit, but it continues to fall further and further. Do you think I just need patience, or is it a better strategy to follow positive trends? For example, an investment in Sandisk a month ago would have brought me tremendous profits, but a similar investment in silver would have trapped me. **What do you think has a higher success rate?** Our main factor is time, and I am always talking about the **long term.** If I don't achieve anything special in the coming years, perhaps one solution is simply to invest in the S&P 500, which has performed slightly better than me over the last two years, where I could have achieved the same results without any effort.",

I usualy open positions in stocks whose financials seem quite good to me companies that are growing at a fairly good pace but the momentum is negative and the stock price is falling such as Google at 150 or Amazon which have brought me quite good profits . However in general I have not_been very successful as many times when investing in falling knives I have found myself trapped for example Novo Nordisk . I thought I had entered at a good point as it had fallen quite a bit but it continues to fall further and further . Do you think I just need patience or is it a better strategy to follow positive trends For example an investment in Sandisk a month ago would have brought me tremendous profits but a similar investment in silver would have trapped me . What do you think has a higher success rate Our main factor is time and I am always talking about the long term . If I dont achieve anything special in the coming years perhaps one solution is simply to invest in the SP 500 which has performed slightly better than me over the last two years where I could have achieved the same results without any effort ."

May I add I prefer being a value investor and looking for undervalued growth stocks. What do you guys do to find new stocks to invest in. What I do is look on Yahoo finance for stocks with stead revenue, earnings and profit growth, low debt, good range P/E ratio and (if possible) PEG under 1. Is this a good way to find good undervalued growth investments or am I out of my mind? What do you guys do? Also, any suggestions on any undervalued growth investments that anyone may know of right now? Thanks",

      "selftext": "Energy production and green technology will be critical over the coming decades as technological growth accelerates. Ensuring reliable power delivery will require significant investment, and new breakthroughs are likely to emerge along the way. I have invested to some extent in a nuclear-focused ETF, as nuclear energy has strong potential for delivering efficient, large-scale power generation. That said, nuclear projects are complex, expensive, and slow to build, so widespread expansion is likely to take decades. Recently, I watched a compelling video on the use of supercritical CO₂ in energy systems, which appears to be a promising emerging technology. My goal is to gain exposure early, before it becomes widely discussed, while diversifying within the energy production sector. Energy demand is expected to rise sharply in the coming decades, and meeting that demand is already a major challenge. I am interested in ways to invest in this technology and other emerging energy solutions while avoiding the higher risk associated with individual stocks. I understand that the U.S. was previously seen as a leader in this area, but China brought a commercially successful supercritical CO₂ power plant online in late 2025, marking a significant milestone. I would welcome any thoughts or suggestions on investment approaches in this space. [Link to youtube video ](",

      "selftext": "Disney has named Josh D’Amaro, chairman of Disney Experiences, as its next CEO, succeeding Bob Iger and clinching a closely watched succession race at the Mouse House. D’Amaro’s appointment will be effective as of March 18 at Disney’s annual meeting. Iger will serve as a senior advisor and Disney board member until he retires from the company on Dec. 31. “Josh D’Amaro is an exceptional leader and the right person to become our next CEO,” Iger said in a statement. “He has an instinctive appreciation of the Disney brand, and a deep understanding of what resonates with our audiences, paired with the rigor and attention to detail required to deliver some of our most ambitious projects. His ability to combine creativity with operational excellence is exemplary and I am thrilled for Josh and the company.” Speculation narrowed to D’Amaro and Walden in recent months. Walden, meanwhile, was named president and chief creative officer on Tuesday as part of the transition announcement. Also effective March 18, Walden is set to report directly to D’Amaro and focus on the storytelling and content engine of Disney. D’Amaro steps into the role at Disney after a period of leadership uncertainty and mixed reception from Wall Street on the state of Disney’s business. On Monday Disney reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped expectations boosted by its theme parks and streaming yet the stock lost 7%. Iger told investors he was confident in the changes made at Disney over the last three years and its path to future success. In particular, the experiences unit that houses the theme parks, resorts and cruises, reported more than $10 billion in quarterly revenue during the period for the first time. The company is planning to develop a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi separate from its commitment to invest $60 billion in its theme parks over the next decade and is looking to capitalize on its dominance of the box office in 2025.

D ’ Amaro steps into the role at Disney after a period of leadership uncertainty and mixed reception from Wall Street on the state of Disney ’ s business . On Monday Disney reported quarterly earnings and revenue that topped expectations boosted by its theme parks and streaming yet the stock lost 7 % . Iger told investors he was confident in the changes made at Disney over the last three years and its path to future success .

      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer thesis. I hold no position.** I’ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix’s latest guidance. If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022, you can officially burn that thesis. The Empire has struck back. They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade, effectively transitioning from a cash-burning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape. But here is the conflict: **I love the business. I respect the execution. But I hate the stock at these levels.** As a researcher, my job isn't to applaud the product, it's to price the risk. And right now, the market is pricing a \"Media Conglomerate\" like it’s still a \"SaaS Monopoly.\" Here is the why Netflix won but why I’m still sitting on my hands. **Part 1: Why I Like the Company (The \"Empire\" Thesis)** The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at \"Sub Count\" while Netflix was fixing the \"Plumbing.\" The Ad-Tier Was a Trojan Horse: The market treated the ad-tier as a desperate \"down-sell\" to stop churn. The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) expansion tool. Ad revenue surged 150% in 2025 and is projected to double again to $3B in 2026. They aren't just \"saving\" users; they are monetizing the \"freeloaders\" at a higher margin. Operational Excellence (The Margin Story): While legacy media (Disney, Paramount) is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes, Netflix has achieved \"Escape Velocity.\" They expanded operating margins to 27% in 2024 and are guiding for 29% in 2025. This is no longer a \"growth at all costs\" shop; it is a cash flow machine. The \"Default\" Utility: Netflix has effectively won the \"churn war.\" With over 300 million subscribers, it has become the global default for video consumption. In a recession, people cancel \"nice-to-haves\" (Starz, Discovery+); they keep the \"Utility\" (Netflix). **Part 2: The Trap (Why I’m NOT Buying)** This is where the \"Momentum\" crowd is about to get hurt. The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection (30x+ PE), but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody is discounting. **1. The WBD Elephant (The Valuation Breaker)** The rumored $83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros. Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis. The Re-Rating Risk: \"Tech Monopolies\" trade at 30x-40x PE. \"Media Conglomerates\" (like Comcast/Disney) trade at 15x-20x PE. If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP (Harry Potter, DC), they aren't just buying content; they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets. You cannot pay a premium \"Tech Multiple\" for a company that is becoming \"Cable Provider 2.0.\" The moment that deal ink dries, the multiple compression could be violent. **2. The \"One-Off\" Growth Illusion** A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown (Paid Sharing). This was a \"Step-Function\" increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once. The market is extrapolating that one-time revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend. Reality Check: We are hitting \"Subscription Saturation.\" The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin. The Verdict: Great Business, Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet. Right now, at near 52week lows, you are paying for: Flawless execution of the Ad-Tier. Zero friction in the WBD integration (if it happens). A \"Tech Premium\" on a \"Media\" business. That is Priced for Perfection. I am keeping my powder dry. I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a \"Media Utility,\" and the multiple compresses back to reality (\\~20x-25x earnings). **Further Discussion Points:** The Deal: If NFLX buys WBD, do you instantly re-rate them as a \"Legacy Media\" stock, or does the \"Tech Halo\" protect the multiple? Ad-Tier: Are you seeing the ad-tier actually cannibalize the premium plans, or is it truly additive? Valuation: Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at \\~12-15%, or is this just pure momentum?",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer thesis . I hold no_position . I ’ ve spent the last week tearing apart the operational data for Netflix ’ s latest guidance . If you were shorting this stock based on the Death of Streaming narrative from 2022 you can officially burn that thesis . The Empire has struck back . They have executed one of the most impressive corporate pivots of the decade effectively transitioning from a cashburning startup to the single most dominant utility in the media landscape . But here is the conflict I love the business . I respect the execution . But I hate the stock at these levels . As a researcher my job isnt to applaud the product its to price the risk . And right now the market is pricing a Media Conglomerate like it ’ s still a SaaS Monopoly . Here is the why Netflix won but why I ’ m still sitting on my hands . Part 1 Why I Like the Company The Empire Thesis The bears missed the nuance of the turnaround because they were looking at Sub Count while Netflix was fixing the Plumbing . The AdTier Was a Trojan Horse The market treated the adtier as a desperate downsell to stop churn . The data proves it was actually a massive ARPU Average Revenue Per User expansion tool . Ad revenue surged 150 % in 2025 and is projected to double again to $ 3B in 2026 . They arent just saving users they are monetizing the freeloaders at a higher margin . Operational Excellence The Margin Story While legacy media Disney Paramount is still bleeding cash trying to build their own pipes Netflix has achieved Escape Velocity . They expanded operating margins to 27 % in 2024 and are guiding for 29 % in 2025 . This is no_longer a growth at all costs shop it is a cash flow machine . The Default Utility Netflix has effectively won the churn war . With over 300 million subscribers it has become the global default for video consumption . In a recession people cancel nicetohaves Starz Discovery they keep the Utility Netflix . Part 2 The Trap Why I ’ m NOT_Buying This is where the Momentum crowd is about to get hurt . The market is pricing NFLX for Perfection 30x PE but the business model is facing two massive structural headwinds that nobody_is discounting . 1 . The WBD Elephant The Valuation Breaker The rumored $ 83 billion acquisition proposal for Warner Bros . Discovery is the single biggest risk to the thesis . The ReRating Risk Tech Monopolies trade at 30x40x PE . Media Conglomerates like ComcastDisney trade at 15x20x PE . If Netflix absorbs WBD to secure IP Harry Potter DC they arent just buying content they are inheriting Debt and Declining Linear Assets . You can not pay a premium Tech Multiple for a company that is becoming Cable Provider 2.0 . The moment that deal ink dries the multiple compression could be violent . 2 . The OneOff Growth Illusion A huge chunk of the recent growth came from the Password Crackdown Paid Sharing . This was a StepFunction increase you can only force a freeloader to subscribe once . The market is extrapolating that onetime revenue bump as a permanent linear growth trend . Reality Check We are hitting Subscription Saturation . The next leg of growth relies on price hikes in a consumer environment that is already stretched thin . The Verdict Great Business Dangerous Price Investing is about the asymmetry of the bet . Right now at near 52week lows you are paying for Flawless execution of the AdTier . Zero friction in the WBD integration if it happens . A Tech Premium on a Media business . That is Priced for Perfection . I am keeping my powder dry . I will look to enter when the market realizes that the WBD deal makes Netflix a Media Utility and the multiple compresses back to reality 20x25x earnings . Further Discussion Points The Deal If NFLX buys WBD do you instantly rerate them as a Legacy Media stock or does the Tech Halo protect the multiple AdTier Are you seeing the adtier actually cannibalize the premium plans or is it truly additive Valuation Is a 30x PE justifiable for a company growing revenue at 1215 % or is this just pure momentum"

The price has held steady for the last couple months, but analysts are still raising prices, and predicting a massive run up. Would it be smart to add around 4000 to nvidia, prior to the earnings. I’m 24 with 52,900 invested into index funds, and a long term time horizon. Or should I start putting money into google, given its future potential, and recent run up.",

      "selftext": "[ The 'Warsh shock (shock)' ended in just one day. The Kospi, which had plummeted over 5% the previous day and fell below the 5,000-point mark, surged over 6% on the 3rd, setting a record high based on the closing price. On that day, the Kospi closed at 5,288.08, up 6.84% (338.41 points) from the previous day. The increase exceeded the previous day’s decline of 274.69 points. The day’s gain was the largest since March 24, 2020 (8.6%), during the height of the 'Donghak Ant Movement'. Institutions and foreigners led the index rebound by net buying approximately 2 trillion Korean won and 700 billion Korean won, respectively. Individuals net sold nearly 3 trillion Korean won. Lee Jaewon, a researcher at Shinhan Securities, said, “Foreigners and institutions, who had been net sellers for four consecutive trading days, switched to simultaneous net buying,” adding, “The nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair and the sharp drop in commodity prices, which increased volatility the previous day, merely served as an excuse for short-term profit-taking.” Upward revisions in overseas investment banks’ forecasts also supported investor sentiment. JP Morgan, on the 2nd, local time, raised the base scenario target for the Kospi to 6,000 and the bullish scenario target to 7,500 in its 'Korea Equity Strategy' report. JP Morgan noted that while semiconductors have led the rally, profit growth is also continuing in sectors such as defense, shipbuilding, and power equipment, and governance reforms could lead to a re-rating of valuations.",

      "title": "Bought a lot of $SLV, I think silver outperforms into 2026",
      "selftext": "The main reason is simple: silver is lagging hard while the setup keeps improving. Historically, when gold starts moving and holds higher levels, silver follows with leverage. We haven’t really seen that move yet. The gold/silver ratio is still stretched, and every time that starts to normalize, silver ends up outperforming by a lot. On top of that, silver isn’t just a \"store of value\" metal. It’s tied directly to real demand. Solar, electronics, EVs, data centers, all of it needs silver. That demand doesn’t care about rates or narratives. Supply is the other side of this. New silver supply isn’t growing meaningfully, and a lot of silver comes as a byproduct from other mining. You don’t just flip a switch and get more. Macro wise, the backdrop going into 2025–2026 looks supportive. Debt keeps growing, currencies keep getting diluted, and geopolitical risk isn’t exactly fading. In those environments, metals usually start moving quietly before everyone notices. To me, that’s why $SLV makes sense here. It’s still cheap relative to gold, demand is real, supply is tight, and if risk spikes, silver tends to catch up fast. Markets rotate, they don’t move evenly. If money flows out of crowded trades and into metals, silver usually gets the most aggressive move because it’s still underowned. That’s why I think a 3–4x move isn’t unrealistic short term if rotation accelerates. Edit: Interesting how bearish most people are on $SLV I’m not here to argue but let’s just revisit this post in a month and see how it played out.",

      "selftext_processed": "The main reason is simple silver is lagging hard while the setup keeps improving . Historically when gold starts moving and holds higher levels silver follows with leverage . We haven ’ t really seen that move yet . The goldsilver ratio is still stretched and every time that starts to normalize silver ends up outperforming by a lot . On top of that silver isn ’ t just a store of value metal . It ’ s tied directly to real demand . Solar electronics EVs data centers all of it needs silver . That demand doesn ’ t care about rates or narratives . Supply is the other side of this . New silver supply isn ’ t growing meaningfully and a lot of silver comes as a byproduct from other mining . You don ’ t just flip a switch and get more . Macro wise the backdrop going into 2025–2026 looks supportive . Debt keeps growing currencies keep getting diluted and geopolitical risk isn ’ t exactly fading . In those environments metals usually start moving quietly before everyone notices . To me that ’ s why $ SLV makes sense here . It ’ s still cheap relative to gold demand is real supply is tight and if risk spikes silver tends to catch up fast . Markets rotate they don ’ t move evenly . If money flows out of crowded trades and into metals silver usually gets the most aggressive move because it ’ s still underowned . That ’ s why I think a 3–4x move isn ’ t unrealistic short term if rotation accelerates . Edit Interesting how bearish most people are on $ SLV I ’ m not_here to argue but let ’ s just revisit this post in a month and see how it played out ."

      "selftext": "I don't necessarily believe that this will happen. However, if it does happen, it will be a hard time for all. The Fed was late to hike rates back in 2022 when inflation was rising. During that time, despite CPI being at 5%, they said inflation was transitory. The full effects of rate changes, from one extreme to another, take an awful long time to see their full effects. Fed funds were cut to 0% in April of 2020. They did not realize inflation was a problem until 2022, almost a year and a half later. During this time, the stock market had ripped 115% from the COVID lows, people were buying houses before seeing them, and offering 50-100k over asking. NFT's and the metaverse became a big thing as well, which, as it turned out, was absolutely garbage. Stocks like RIVN, GME, and AMC became hyperbolic. Yes, the Ukraine invasion and the consequent block of Russia added to the cause. I will address this a bit further down. There was a bubble. The stock market finally corrected 25%, meme stocks went down, and mortgage rates went up, putting a stop to the overly high demand for buying houses. Fed funds later peak at 5.25-5.5 in August of 2023. He then cuts rates to 3.5-3.75, Powell continues to say that we are at a comfortable range to hold. If true, this is their version of \"inflation was transitory\". The supreme court is to make a decision on the tariffs being upheld; i believe this is the \"ukraine moment\" to deflation. Supply will rush, causing higher supply and lower prices. AI is another plausible accelerator to lowering service costs. The fact is that inflation has already been lowered, from 9% to 2-3%. Any lessening of cutting rates, combined with supreme court's decision, will unleash a fury of chaos. As the regime shifts, gold and silver coming down might be the first sign of this. Deflation is the lowering of prices; gold and silver's prices are lower in past few trading days. Historically, gold had performed well during deflationary cycles; however, that is in the past. Gold was used as a means of wealth. The main question is, just like bitcoin, is gold a shiny object syndrome? Food for thought. The left tail is always fat. Per Powell, the tail is always fatter than what you think it is. I think there is a conversation to have about deflation. I also think that there is a probability of resurgence of inflation (tariffs working through the supply chain + the lack of data due to government shut down (mostly shelter)).",

The Fed was late to hike rates back in 2022 when inflation was rising . During that time despite CPI being at 5 % they said inflation was transitory . The full effects of rate changes from one extreme to another take an awful long time to see their full effects . Fed funds were cut to 0 % in April of 2020 . They did not_realize inflation was a problem until 2022 almost a year and a half later . During this time the stock market had ripped 115 % from the COVID lows people were buying houses before seeing them and offering 50100k over asking . NFTs and the metaverse became a big thing as well which as it turned out was absolutely garbage . Stocks like RIVN GME and AMC became hyperbolic . Yes the Ukraine invasion and the consequent block of Russia added to the cause . I will address this a bit further down . There was a bubble . The stock market finally corrected 25 % meme stocks went down and mortgage rates went up putting a stop to the overly high demand for buying houses . Fed funds later peak at 5.255.5 in August of 2023 . He then cuts rates to 3.53.75 Powell continues to say that we are at a comfortable range to hold . If true this is their version of inflation was transitory . The supreme court is to make a decision on the tariffs being upheld i believe this is the ukraine moment to deflation . Supply will rush causing higher supply and lower prices . AI is another plausible accelerator to lowering service costs . The fact is that inflation has already been lowered from 9 % to 23 % . Any lessening of cutting rates combined with supreme courts decision will unleash a fury of chaos . As the regime shifts gold and silver coming down might be the first sign of this . Deflation is the lowering of prices gold and silvers prices are lower in past few trading days . Historically gold had performed well during deflationary cycles however that is in the past . Gold was used as a means of wealth . The main question is just like bitcoin is gold a shiny object syndrome Food for thought . The left tail is always fat . Per Powell the tail is always fatter than what you think it is . I think there is a conversation to have about deflation . I also think that there is a probability of resurgence of inflation tariffs working through the supply chain the lack of data due to government shut down mostly shelter ."

      "title": "How much total wealth is now bubble wealth? Are we at a high?",
      "selftext": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth. I'd define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on non-producing assets without an underlying, historical, or productive market value. Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone, can collapse when the faith vanishes, with nobody willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse. In fact, there's no concept of a 'bargain' for a bubble commodity. Once the faith is gone, the value is gone. Real wealth examples: * real estate that people live in, using money from jobs. Or functioning commercial real estate. * stocks with a historically non-insane PE (say, less than 25 or 30). Yes, there's an exception for genuine likelihood of growth. * gold at historical prices (gold is faith based, but it's 10,000 years of faith). * dollars, exchangeable for above, as long as inflation is sane. * Dutch tulips c. 1635; Beanie Babies c. 1995. Bubble wealth examples: * the part of gold price above its historical norm, say $2500 (ie, a bit over plateau before 2024). Gold's current bubble value would be $16T using total amount of gold in existence; but only 22% is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits, so maybe just $3T. * most of silver's current price, but most of silver is in non-investment form. Silver has a $5T total cap, but only 5% is held as coin or bullion, so ignore silver. * cryptocurrency. Current bubble value $2.6T, assuming all crypto is hokum. * the $3T of AI infrastructure build-up could be bubble wealth, in full or in part. * real estate used to park money, that could not be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition. Bubble value: very hard to guess; the total [value of real estate shot up from $30T to $50T after covid,( when CPI says it should have gone to 38T, so there's $12T of bubble value maybe, unless the increase of prices is fundamental. * stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA - I'd say TSLA is 90% bubble but hard to say for NVDA. 50%? Anyway, maybe $4T just for these, then a bunch of other stocks, at various bubble fractions. * one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 20-25 (?) and today's value of 30 is bubble wealth, so at least 20% of the US market ($14T) is bubble wealth, but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated, and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up, with bargain hunters waiting to pile on. So let's not count the high current P/E, or discount its bubbliness by a lot. The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly, however. So there seems to be at least $20T of faith-based wealth out there, perhaps 65% of US GDP. The stock market lost $8T (equivalent to $12T today) in 2008; it lost $5T ($10T today) in 2000. Housing lost something like $6T in 2008, suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of today's bubble wealth. Comments? Are we in a record era bubble wealth? Or is this the wrong way to look at things?",

      "selftext_processed": "I was idly thinking of bubble wealth vs real wealth . Id define bubble wealth to be perceived wealth based on nonproducing assets without an underlying historical or productive market value . Bubble wealth is held up by faith alone can collapse when the faith vanishes with nobody_willing to scoop up bargains after a collapse . In fact theres no_concept of a bargain for a bubble commodity . Once the faith is gone the value is gone . Real wealth examples real estate that people live in using money from jobs . Or functioning commercial real estate . stocks with a historically noninsane PE say less than 25 or 30 . Yes theres an exception for genuine likelihood of growth . gold at historical prices gold is faith based but its 10000 years of faith . dollars exchangeable for above as long as inflation is sane . Dutch tulips c. 1635 Beanie Babies c. 1995 . Bubble wealth examples the part of gold price above its historical norm say $ 2500 ie a bit over plateau before 2024 . Golds current bubble value would be $ 16T using total amount of gold in existence but only 22 % is in private bullion rather than jewelry or central deposits so maybe just $ 3T . most of silvers current price but most of silver is in noninvestment form . Silver has a $ 5T total cap but only 5 % is held as coin or bullion so ignore silver . cryptocurrency . Current bubble value $ 2.6T assuming all crypto is hokum . the $ 3T of AI infrastructure buildup could be bubble wealth in full or in part . real estate used to park money that could not_be rented to cover a large fraction of the cost of acquisition . Bubble value very hard to guess the total value of real estate shot up from $ 30T to $ 50T after covid when CPI says it should have gone to 38T so theres $ 12T of bubble value maybe unless the increase of prices is fundamental . stocks like TSLA and maybe PLNTR and NVDA Id say TSLA is 90 % bubble but hard to say for NVDA . 50 % Anyway maybe $ 4T just for these then a bunch of other stocks at various bubble fractions . one could argue that the difference between a sensible SP500 PE of 2025 and todays value of 30 is bubble wealth so at least 20 % of the US market $ 14T is bubble wealth but high stock PEs can be sustained or slowly deflated and there is a fundamental value floor holding stocks up with bargain hunters waiting to pile on . So lets not_count the high current PE or discount its bubbliness by a lot . The fact that investible money is chasing actual bubbles like gold and crypto instead of stocks suggests that the market is bubbly however . So there seems to be at least $ 20T of faithbased wealth out there perhaps 65 % of US GDP . The stock market lost $ 8T equivalent to $ 12T today in 2008 it lost $ 5T $ 10T today in 2000 . Housing lost something like $ 6T in 2008 suggesting that the total 2008 dip in nominal wealth could be on the order of todays bubble wealth . Comments Are we in a record era bubble wealth Or is this the wrong way to look at things"

      "selftext": "So with RACE hitting a new 52 week low last month, I’m trying to understand what’s going on with the stock. The stock initially got jack hammered because of weak guidance for their 2030 revenue outlook, which gave people a scare about whether Ferrari still had room for growth or not. I’m currently holding and adding to my position but it seems like sentiment around the stock isn’t changing much. Is the stock somewhat in a holding period where it’s waiting to see what Ferrari will do next or is it waiting to see how the geopolitics play out? I mean on the bullish side they have absolute 100% control of the supply side of the demand curve so it’s not like they’re having issues with production, they’ve got that multi year waitlist for the exclusive stuff, and they’ve pretty much gotten the lifestyle aspect down pretty good between the fashion, and their theme park. Wanna see what everyone else thinks about it. It’s just a super interesting stock to me.",

The stock initially got jack hammered because of weak guidance for their 2030 revenue outlook which gave people a scare about whether Ferrari still had room for growth or not_I ’ m currently holding and adding to my position but it seems like sentiment around the stock isn ’ t changing much . Is the stock somewhat in a holding period where it ’ s waiting to see what Ferrari will do next or is it waiting to see how the geopolitics play out I mean on the bullish side they have absolute 100 % control of the supply side of the demand curve so it ’ s not_like they ’ re having issues with production they ’ ve got that multi year waitlist for the exclusive stuff and they ’ ve pretty much gotten the lifestyle aspect down pretty good between the fashion and their theme park . Wan na see what everyone else thinks about it . It ’ s just a super interesting stock to me ."

Theme parks are performing incredibly well, streaming finally turned profitable with meaningful margin expansion. But investors seem spooked by Iger's exit and who's taking over. Is this a buying opportunity on leadership FUD, or are the succession concerns legitimate enough to avoid DIS until there's clarity?

I speak to our friends who feel like they are also going through the same things. It feels like such a façade seeing the stock market rise so heavily in hearing that economy is doing so well when I feel like most of the Americans, I speak to believe that their lives have been getting worse. Interesting article to read but PE ratio for the SP500 is at roughly 40 which was the similar PE when the stock market corrected in the dot com bubble and 2008. That’s why companies like Microsoft got punished, even though they beat expectations. Time to sell and keep cash, I have a bad feeling about this $7000. The stakes, in short, are high for bulls to eclipse the 7,000 psychological hurdle, and then hold it. The last time we tested 7,000 was Jan. 28, and markets quickly retrenched. What are y’all thinking?",

I speak to our friends who feel like they are also going through the same things . It feels like such a façade seeing the stock market rise so heavily in hearing that economy is doing so well when I feel like most of the Americans I speak to believe that their lives have been getting worse . Interesting article to read but PE ratio for the SP500 is at roughly 40 which was the similar PE when the stock market corrected in the dot com bubble and 2008 . That ’ s why companies like Microsoft got punished even though they beat expectations . Time to sell and keep cash I have a bad feeling about this $ 7000 . The stakes in short are high for bulls to eclipse the 7000 psychological hurdle and then hold it . The last time we tested 7000 was Jan. 28 and markets quickly retrenched . What are y ’ all thinking"

      "title": "TTD isn’t a Turn Around Story",
      "selftext": "TTD is polarizing. Some believe it to be significantly undervalued. Others believe it’s still a hefty premium. If one were to simply look at TTD finacials they’d be confused. Low debt, high profits, revenue but slowing growth, decent mote…so what gives. Some believe TTD to still be Overvalued. It’s priced like Amazon but with increased competition,3 CFO’s leaving in one year. Shrinking margins and a singular mote that’s lost its edge. I’m on the bearish side now, here’s what made me reconsider my investment with this company Amazon is a new competitor, i believe it will take business away from TTD. Why do I think this? Because Amazon is offering an ideal product at an 80percent cheaper price. If I’m looking to advertise between TTD and Amazon 9/10 I’m going with Amazon. I think the walled garden dismissal of Amazon is a critical mistake on the investors part. Many current clients of TTD may not want to pay out 80percent more because of some conspiracy like conflict of interest. Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor, it’s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration. Secondly at least half of TTD clients could potentially be lost because of the significant difference in pricing. TTD will have to lower margins to compete against Amazon eventually even to maintain its current clientele. Some will argue that Walmart doesn’t want to advertise on Amazon because of whole-foods but who says they go with TTD? It seems like this field is ever more competitive with each year. The CEO of TTD is no Bezos. When you believe in a company and you genuinely believe it’s a diamond in a rough time/your baby I’d want a CEO that shows up for his company. Jeff Green worth 2.3Billion is anything but communicative with investors/shareholders. I want you to think about this, Jeff Green has only sold shares in the past years of TTD but has never bought any shares. I understand he gets stock based Comp, but he sold 181million dollars last year. Think about this for one second and it becomes obvious. \\*if you the CEO believe your company is being wrongly priced having access to financials after a singificant correction in your stock you’d be buying with that insight hand over fist. That is what a good CEO DOES,not sell exessively Jeff Green has sold 500million dollars worth of shares since 2021(4.3million shares) . He now has 1.3million. He couldn’t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction? He gets paid in stock comp, okay explain Why TF you’d sell 500million worth and not buy back in at a far lower price? Because he doesn’t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he’d value it at that’s why. I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who’s been radio silent this entire year and hasn’t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he’s withdrawn? What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways? For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021(Nvidia CEO/most expensive company). 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year, I’ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread. [ ]( So CEO sucks, mote is dying, margins will compress, higher PE than Amazon, leading me to believe TTD is still overvalued. I would like to preface I could be wrong, some may disagree, this is what I believe. This could be a tailwind for TTD but I Think It’s more of an impending doom on the horizon for TTD. I highly encourage different perspectives and not 2nd grade jabs,uninspired snide rhetoric Reddit/what gets me likes. i hope to see your opinions and thoughts on this company.",

      "selftext_processed": "TTD is polarizing . Some believe it to be significantly undervalued . Others believe it ’ s still a hefty premium . If one were to simply look at TTD finacials they ’ d be confused . Low debt high profits revenue but slowing growth decent mote…so what gives . Some believe TTD to still be Overvalued . It ’ s priced like Amazon but with increased competition3 CFO ’ s leaving in one year . Shrinking margins and a singular mote that ’ s lost its edge . I ’ m on the bearish side now here ’ s what made me reconsider my investment with this company Amazon is a new competitor i believe it will take business away from TTD . Why do I think this Because Amazon is offering an ideal product at an 80percent cheaper price . If I ’ m looking to advertise between TTD and Amazon 910 I ’ m going with Amazon . I think the walled garden dismissal of Amazon is a critical mistake on the investors part . Many current clients of TTD may not_want to pay out 80percent more because of some conspiracy like conflict of interest . Firstly it is a conspiracy that Amazon will treat them differently even if they are a competitor it ’ s completely unfounded but a still reasonable consideration . Secondly at least half of TTD clients could potentially be lost because of the significant difference in pricing . TTD will have to lower margins to compete against Amazon eventually even to maintain its current clientele . Some will argue that Walmart doesn ’ t want to advertise on Amazon because of wholefoods but who says they go with TTD It seems like this field is ever more competitive with each year . The CEO of TTD is no_Bezos . When you believe in a company and you genuinely believe it ’ s a diamond in a rough timeyour baby I ’ d want a CEO that shows up for his company . Jeff Green worth 2.3Billion is anything but communicative with investorsshareholders . I want you to think about this Jeff Green has only sold shares in the past years of TTD but has never_bought any shares . I understand he gets stock based Comp but he sold 181million dollars last year . Think about this for one second and it becomes obvious . if you the CEO believe your company is being wrongly priced having access to financials after a singificant correction in your stock you ’ d be buying with that insight hand over fist . That is what a good CEO DOESnot sell exessively Jeff Green has sold 500million dollars worth of shares since 20214.3million shares . He now has 1.3million . He couldn ’ t buy 100million of his own company after a significant correction He gets paid in stock comp okay explain Why TF you ’ d sell 500million worth and not_buy back in at a far lower price Because he doesn ’ t believe in TTD future or that the stock price reflects what he ’ d value it at that ’ s why . I get wanting to believe in a company…but how can you believe in someone like Jeff Green who ’ s been radio silent this entire year and hasn ’ t even considered buying his own stock with idk 20percent of what he ’ s withdrawn What does he really need 500million dollars for anyways For the record Jensen Huang Sold 1 billion since 2021Nvidia CEOmost expensive company . 3 CFO changes spells a horrible future for the company in under 1 year I ’ ll link thee opinions of an unrelated company that had this happen a year ago and the unbiased opinions from this thread . So CEO sucks mote is dying margins will compress higher PE than Amazon leading me to believe TTD is still overvalued . I would like to preface I could be wrong some may disagree this is what I believe . This could be a tailwind for TTD but I Think It ’ s more of an impending doom on the horizon for TTD . I highly encourage different perspectives and not_2nd grade jabsuninspired snide rhetoric Redditwhat gets me likes . i hope to see your opinions and thoughts on this company ."

      "title": "Silver market : biggest trap ever ?",
      "selftext": "I'm trying to learn a bit about the silver market. And the first thing that caught my attention is the fact that the silver market is considered heavily manipulated. Indeed, more than 90% of investors only buy paper silver to bet on the price of silver. They have no intention of owning physical silver. As a result, the COMEX can simply use its leverage to manipulate the paper price movements. And every time the price of silver has risen sharply for X reasons (often speculative), the COMEX has always managed to change the rules to kill the silver price. Today, people are saying it's different because there's a shortage in COMEX reserves and the physical price in certain places, especially Shanghai, is varying between $120 and $130. Indeed, this year China has placed small orders to withdraw massive amounts of physical silver from the COMEX. However, that doesn't change the rules of the game at all. Physical silver demand is far greater than supply, and yet the silver price hasn't particularly increased. The only thing that has driven up COMEX prices is the Chinese intervention. And the COMEX has issued several successive margin calls to keep the silver price quite low. What about physical silver? From what I understand, mines don't sell at the true physical price. They sell at the paper silver price. Sometimes they build up stocks to sell later, anticipating higher prices. But paper silver prices always remain the compass for long-term contracts. So even if physical silver is selling for $130 in Shanghai, a Canadian mining company will sell it for $70 per ounce because the COMEX has kept the price down. In fact, I get the impression that this market is rotten. We're not investing in silver, but in a totally manipulated financial product.",

      "selftext_processed": "Im trying to learn a bit about the silver market . And the first thing that caught my attention is the fact that the silver market is considered heavily manipulated . Indeed more than 90 % of investors only buy paper silver to bet on the price of silver . They have no_intention of owning physical silver . As a result the COMEX can simply use its leverage to manipulate the paper price movements . And every time the price of silver has risen sharply for X reasons often speculative the COMEX has always managed to change the rules to kill the silver price . Today people are saying its different because theres a shortage in COMEX reserves and the physical price in certain places especially Shanghai is varying between $ 120 and $ 130 . Indeed this year China has placed small orders to withdraw massive amounts of physical silver from the COMEX . However that doesnt change the rules of the game at all . Physical silver demand is far greater than supply and yet the silver price hasnt particularly increased . The only thing that has driven up COMEX prices is the Chinese intervention . And the COMEX has issued several successive margin calls to keep the silver price quite low . What about physical silver From what I understand mines dont sell at the true physical price . They sell at the paper silver price . Sometimes they build up stocks to sell later anticipating higher prices . But paper silver prices always remain the compass for longterm contracts . So even if physical silver is selling for $ 130 in Shanghai a Canadian mining company will sell it for $ 70 per ounce because the COMEX has kept the price down . In fact I get the impression that this market is rotten . Were not_investing in silver but in a totally manipulated financial product ."

      "title": "Oracle +6% pre-market after plans $45B to $50B capital raise in 2026 to expand AI cloud",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >Oracle Corp. plans to raise $45 billion to $50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity, reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI’s growth. >Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company’s largest cloud customers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Nvidia Corp., OpenAI, TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp., the company said in a statement Sunday. >The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligence-linked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off. The company’s shares have fallen around 50% from its record price on Sept. 10, wiping out roughly $460 billion in market value. >Shares fell about 3% in premarket trading on Monday. Oracle’s stock had declined 2.6% to close at $164.58 in New York on Friday. >Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle’s free cash flow negative, where it is expected to stay until 2030, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years, largely on semiconductors and leases. >“If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in,” said Gil Luria, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co. >The company plans to raise half of the funds via equity-linked and common equity issuances, including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an at-the-market equity program of as much as $20 billion. >Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investment-grade debt rating, wrote John DiFucci, an analyst at Guggenheim, in a January note. >The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026. The company borrowed $18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year’s largest corporate bond offerings. >But the debt market may not have an appetite for this much investment-grade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps, Luria said. Issuing equity may also hurt the company’s stock price, he said. >Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering, Oracle said. >As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble, investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle, which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis. >A key part of Oracle’s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI, which has committed to spending about $300 billion to rent servers from Oracle. OpenAI is not profitable, adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns. >Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle. The timing, “could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday’s open,” Luria said. *Processing img uc3th276y2hg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Oracle Corp. plans to raise $ 45 billion to $ 50 billion this year through a combination of debt and equity sales to build additional cloud infrastructure capacity reflecting the scale of financing needed to feed AI ’ s growth . Oracle is raising money to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from the company ’ s largest cloud customers including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Meta Platforms Inc. Nvidia Corp. OpenAI TikTok Inc. and xAI Corp. the company said in a statement Sunday . The announcement coincides with persistent fears about whether massive artificial intelligencelinked investments by tech companies such as Oracle will pay off . The company ’ s shares have fallen around 50 % from its record price on Sept. 10 wiping out roughly $ 460 billion in market value . Shares fell about 3 % in premarket trading on Monday . Oracle ’ s stock had declined 2.6 % to close at $ 164.58 in New York on Friday . Developing AI data centers has pushed Oracle ’ s free cash flow negative where it is expected to stay until 2030 according to data compiled by Bloomberg . The company is on the hook for tens of billions of dollars in spending in the coming years largely on semiconductors and leases . “ If Oracle can complete the raise successfully it will start digging itself out of the considerable hole it has found itself in ” said Gil Luria an analyst at DA Davidson Co . The company plans to raise half of the funds via equitylinked and common equity issuances including mandatory convertible preferred securities and through an atthemarket equity program of as much as $ 20 billion . Issuing equity would help send a message to the market that Oracle is serious about maintaining its investmentgrade debt rating wrote John DiFucci an analyst at Guggenheim in a January note . The rest of its funding target would be raised via a single issuance of bonds early in 2026 . The company borrowed $ 18 billion in 2025 in what was one of the year ’ s largest corporate bond offerings . But the debt market may not_have an appetite for this much investmentgrade debt from Oracle given its existing commitments and trading in its credit default swaps Luria said . Issuing equity may also hurt the company ’ s stock price he said . Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering and Citigroup Inc. will be leading the atthemarket issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering Oracle said . As Oracle debt swelled and Wall Street raised concerns of an artificial intelligence bubble investors rushed to buy credit default swaps tied to Oracle which by December pushed the prices on some of the derivatives to the highest since the 2008 financial crisis . A key part of Oracle ’ s cloud investment is its contract with OpenAI which has committed to spending about $ 300 billion to rent servers from Oracle . OpenAI is not_profitable adding to worries about the financial strains from huge capital expenditures without a clear timeline for meaningful returns . Making this significant of an announcement on a Sunday afternoon is unusual for a mature company like Oracle . The timing “ could be the management team trying to stop the endless slide in the share price by trying to give investors some hope ahead of Monday ’ s open ” Luria said .

      "selftext": "BARK Inc., is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to go-private in a all-cash transaction. The first proposal: BARK stock started 2025 at $2 with a continuous drop until $0.60. The Co-Founder, Executive Chairman & CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $0.60 and pushed the stock price down. A few weeks later, the CEO with the insiders made a go-private offer at $0.90 per share. They control nearly 39% of BARK already. Their offer was a relief for some retail holders, as it was nearly 50% higher than the current sp then. But, it was actually a low-ball offer for a artificially beaten down stock. The second proposal: In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $0.90, another major shareholder, Shay Capital, criticized the management and made two proposals: First, its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors, Second, a stock buy-back up to $25 million, as in their opinion, BARK stock price at $0.90 was very undervalued. A few days later than the CEO/insiders proposal at $0.90, Klugman with Marcus Lemonis (CEO of BBBY) made their buyout proposal at $1.10 per share. (Remember, Klugman does not accept the $0.90. He stated that in October. Then he said the sp at $0.90 is too low). So, there are two parties, already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders, who will try to acquire the company. They are both serious: \\-CEO/insiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a low-ball offer following it. \\-Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis. \\-Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff, a pet firm with retail stores. He grew Bentley with many acquisitions. Bentley sell pet foods, but don't make its own. BARK is making pet foods, so the synergies between these two are obvious. Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH, acquiring/delisting a company, merged it, re-listing it again. I think it will take time, but during times of uncertainty, the potential of a 22% gain from Klugman-Lemonis offer and the secured CEO/insiders offer bring a great risk/reward ratio. BARK currently trades at $0.89 and it dropped even at $0.85. These prices are below both offers. The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $1.10. Until then, both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down. Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th, but they are not important anymore.",

      "selftext_processed": "BARK Inc. is the second pet company which received recently two buyout proposals to goprivate in a allcash transaction . The first proposal BARK stock started 2025 at $ 2 with a continuous drop until $ 0.60 . The CoFounder Executive Chairman CEO Matt Meeker and other insiders sold near $ 0.60 and pushed the stock price down . A few weeks later the CEO with the insiders made a goprivate offer at $ 0.90 per share . They control nearly 39 % of BARK already . Their offer was a relief for some retail holders as it was nearly 50 % higher than the current sp then . But it was actually a lowball offer for a artificially beaten down stock . The second proposal In October 2025 with the BARK stock dropping below $ 0.90 another major shareholder Shay Capital criticized the management and made two proposals First its main holder Nachum Klugman to participate in the board of directors Second a stock buyback up to $ 25 million as in their opinion BARK stock price at $ 0.90 was very undervalued . A few days later than the CEOinsiders proposal at $ 0.90 Klugman with Marcus Lemonis CEO of BBBY made their buyout proposal at $ 1.10 per share . Remember Klugman does not_accept the $ 0.90 . He stated that in October . Then he said the sp at $ 0.90 is too low . So there are two parties already with deep knowledge of BARK and already shareholders who will try to acquire the company . They are both serious CEOinsiders have orchestrated for months a share price drop and a lowball offer following it . Klugman have stated that the CEO offer is too low to be accepted and made his own with Lemonis . Lemonis has acquired a controlling stake in Bentley Pet Stuff a pet firm with retail stores . He grew Bentley with many acquisitions . Bentley sell pet foods but dont make its own . BARK is making pet foods so the synergies between these two are obvious . Lemonis has followed the same tactic with CWH acquiringdelisting a company merged it relisting it again . I think it will take time but during times of uncertainty the potential of a 22 % gain from KlugmanLemonis offer and the secured CEOinsiders offer bring a great riskreward ratio . BARK currently trades at $ 0.89 and it dropped even at $ 0.85 . These prices are below both offers . The wildcard exists and it is a bidding war that will increase the offered price above the $ 1.10 . Until then both parties will try to take with their side more shareholders while they have any reason to keep the stock price down . Next financial results for BARK will be out in February the 5th but they are not_important anymore ."

      "selftext": "The U.S. national debt surpassed $38 trillion in October 2025, only two months after crossing the $37 trillion mark. Some news outlets are framing the Federal Reserve’s latest fed chef replacement proposal as evidence that the dollar is becoming significantly stronger. I find that misleading. Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn’t signal a strong dollar especially not merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place. What we need is real fiscal progress, not just new faces saying things are improving. I’m not convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem. Given the current circumstances, is it an exaggeration to call the dollar ‘ becoming strong’?",

Adding another trillion dollars of debt in such a short period doesn ’ t signal a strong dollar especially not_merely because the Fed claims to have better leadership or talent in place . What we need is real fiscal progress not_just new faces saying things are improving . I ’ m not_convinced that the next Fed leader will be able to resolve the debt problem .

Positions: MU Feb 20 26 $400 puts, SNDK Feb 20 26 $500 puts. **Parabolic Pumps** These memory names ran **100–200% in under two months** on HBM/NAND hype. The last **3 trading days** look like textbook tops. # MU — Exhaustion in Plain Sight **Technical red flags:** * RSI peaked near **Thesis:** **10–20% pullback** likely # SNDK — Absolute Mania **Technical insanity:** * RSI hit **Thesis:** **15–30% downside** Target zone: **$400** this is **momentum exhaustion after face-melting runs** # Combine this: Metals/crypto volatility = de-risking = tech rotation out.

      "selftext": "*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)* ***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.*** ***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.*** ***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.*** Hola fellow regards, If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.]( It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares. Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point. [Quite a return if you ask me.]( Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… # Rich Sparkle is a \"printing company\" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all. With a consideration of nearly $975 million dollars, most would think that Rich Sparkle is, in some way, a firm that’s engaged within the social media or technology space. Maybe an A.I influencer company or something? It’s what I thought too, but Rich Sparkle’s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements. Yes. Printing and designing financial statements. [Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th, 2025.]( A financial statements printing company is paying $975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok’s most popular influencer. What’s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they’re paying Khaby Lame for this company. The company only raked in just $5.88m in revenue the previous year, yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars? [Again, per the prospectus.]( [Listed on the prospectus, ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade.]( $ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th, 2025, raising just **$5m in IPO proceeds** [**(6-k pg.11)**]( The company issued out just 10% of their current shares, which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $50m come the time of the IPO (shares would eventually dilute out to \\~5% of outstanding shares being publicly traded). Just a month later, the stock that initially IPO'd at price of around $4 is trading at [$30 bucks and has added nearly $250m in market capitalization]( with literally no material events happening within that time that neither EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too. Inexplicably [the ticker just... stays in that price range for no real reason at all, no material events, nothing]( for the next few months. That changes on December 15th, 2025. [6-k on December 15th.]( The auditor for Rich Sparkle, Wei Wei & Co, resigned as Sparkle's auditor [effective immediately. ]( wouldn't be too much of a problem (for a company of their stature) if it weren't for the fact that the company has [filed notice that their 20-F is going to come late.]( The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only [one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn (who only has one follower), despite being an American company,]( and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with [zero followers]( and [filler posts that are just stock images]( I'm not one to want to cyberbully a small business, but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company (as of 2/1/26) that just did a $975m acquisition... yeah that's a bit sketchy. # The biggest IPO Sparkle's underwriter got involved in... was historic for all the wrong reasons. I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece I'm working on. This section is where I'll clear that up. The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money, would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares. [Per prospectus]( Eddid Securities. [Their website]( says that they help bring small to medium-size companies to the market, stuff the big investment banks don't have the time for. *Small to medium-size companies*, with the exception of one. [Ain't that a lovely throwback]( To any WSBers that were here during 2022, I'm sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you. Their subsidiary, Digital, randomly skyrocketed 30,000% within the span of mere weeks in July-August 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The only problem is that no one exactly knew how this was even possible, and no, it wasn't a meme stock as the media often claimed. AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kong-related stocks (Regencell, Addentax, etc) that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $400b+ at its peak only to dump 90% right after. The guy behind the IPO, Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO, and, a year and a half before, was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of China's biggest investment firms, CMIG. This feud was so public, CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a *fraudster they shouldn't invest with.* [one of us if I'm being real 😶‍🌫️]( While AMTD's stock surge still hasn't been publicly explained yet, it's pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider co-ordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola, Facebook, and Walmart (no I'm not joking) within the span of weeks. The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process? Looking at the underwriting records, where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process ([prospectus]( [Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022]( Of course, this isn't definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital, but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with, while also considering that $ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider co-ordination. AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC (Hong Kong's version of the SEC). They recently got fined for failing to [produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market.]( Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to \"*have lost records and books relating to the listing of multi-million dollar companies*\" # Conclusion. I'm not here to make any definitive claims, but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is, and that the media is not reporting on any of it, at all. With the clear influencer angle, and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has, I feel like it's hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that don't really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally *cooked*. Anyways, hope you enjoyed this write-up. I'm out.",

      "selftext_processed": "For disclosure I dont hold any position in $ ANPA nor do I plan to . I wrote this write up since I found it interesting and also intersects with other work Im doing TLDR Khaby Lame the mostfollowed creator on TikTok sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $ 6m in revenue ... yes this is real . A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publiclyknown employee and hardly any public presence . The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most highprofile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs . Simply put the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets . Hola fellow regards If you ’ ve been reading the news lately you might ’ ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok ’ s most followed creator Khaby Lame selling his name and likeness for just shy of a billion dollars . It ’ s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame ’ s success story . The laidoff machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars looks built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal . According to the SEC filing Khaby Lame sold Step Distinctive Limited from a Hong Kongbased holding company Rich Sparkle Limited for the consideration of $ 975m USD through the issuance of 75m ordinary shares of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive ’ s shareholders . No_cash got exchanged at all purely shares . Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ ANPA and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing up to 600 % from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point . Quite a return if you ask me . Yet take an actual dive into the company that ’ s acquiring Khaby ’ s company and more specifically who even underwrote them within the first place and you ’ re going to get a picture filled with so many redflags you ’ d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… Rich Sparkle is a printing company that has no_business making a deal of this nature ... like at all . With a consideration of nearly $ 975 million dollars most would think that Rich Sparkle is in some way a firm that ’ s engaged within the social media or technology space . Maybe an A.I influencer company or something It ’ s what I thought too but Rich Sparkle ’ s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements . Yes . Printing and designing financial statements . Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th 2025 . A financial statements printing company is paying $ 975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok ’ s most popular influencer . What ’ s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they ’ re paying Khaby Lame for this company . The company only raked in just $ 5.88m in revenue the previous year yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars Again per the prospectus . Listed on the prospectus ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade . $ ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th 2025 raising just $ 5m in IPO proceeds 6k pg.11 The company issued out just 10 % of their current shares which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $ 50m come the time of the IPO shares would eventually dilute out to 5 % of outstanding shares being publicly traded . Just a month later the stock that initially IPOd at price of around $ 4 is trading at $ 30 bucks and has added nearly $ 250m in market capitalization with literally no_material events happening within that time that neither_EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too . Inexplicably the ticker just ... stays in that price range for no_real reason at all no_material events nothing_for the next few months . That changes on December 15th 2025 . 6k on December 15th . The auditor for Rich Sparkle Wei Wei Co resigned as Sparkles auditor effective immediately . wouldnt be too much of a problem for a company of their stature if it werent for the fact that the company has filed notice that their 20F is going to come late . The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn who only has one follower despite being an American company and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with zero followers and filler posts that are just stock images Im not_one to want to cyberbully a small business but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company as of 2126 that just did a $ 975m acquisition ... yeah thats a bit sketchy . The biggest IPO Sparkles underwriter got involved in ... was historic for all the wrong reasons . I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece Im working on . This section is where Ill clear that up . The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares . Per prospectus Eddid Securities . Their website says that they help bring small to mediumsize companies to the market stuff the big investment banks dont have the time for . Small to mediumsize companies with the exception of one . Aint that a lovely throwback To any WSBers that were here during 2022 Im sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you . Their subsidiary Digital randomly skyrocketed 30000 % within the span of mere weeks in JulyAugust 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world . The only problem is that no_one exactly knew how this was even possible and no_it wasnt a meme stock as the media often claimed . AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kongrelated stocks Regencell Addentax etc that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $ 400b at its peak only to dump 90 % right after . The guy behind the IPO Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO and a year and a half before was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of Chinas biggest investment firms CMIG . This feud was so public CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a fraudster they shouldnt invest with . one of us if Im being real 😶‍🌫️ While AMTDs stock surge still hasnt been publicly explained yet its pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider coordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola Facebook and Walmart no Im not_joking within the span of weeks . The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process Looking at the underwriting records where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process prospectus Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022 Of course this isnt definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with while also considering that $ ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider coordination . AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC Hong Kongs version of the SEC . They recently got fined for failing to produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market . Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to have lost records and books relating to the listing of multimillion dollar companies Conclusion . Im not_here to make any definitive claims but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is and that the media is not_reporting on any of it at all . With the clear influencer angle and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has I feel like its hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that dont really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally cooked . Anyways hope you enjoyed this writeup . Im out ."

I think especially as cannabis continues to be more widely accepted as a fun and harmless pastime in moderation, video game demand will continue to climb.

I think especially as cannabis continues to be more widely accepted as a fun and harmless pastime in moderation video game demand will continue to climb . I think however that valuations are rich and the sentiment that personally have toward the sector is shared by many others American or not ."

      "selftext": "The extraordinary price action in metals on Friday was plastered with comments from ex JPM global head Marko Kolanovic warning of massive correction in Silver prices due this year. Interestingly his latest post on X intraday Jan 30 when the price action was unfolding was about SLV rebounding. Peter Schiff sounded similar note at close of trading on Friday. The price action esp for Silver was truly extraordinary. One for the record books however I don’t think the doom and gloom end of the world posts all over the web actually capture the underlying structural shifts that have been in play in the precious metals market over the last year. 1 - physical demand story for Silver is still intact. The AI buildout, industrial demand for solar, electronics is still there. The biggest global silver miner Fresnillo has actually cut its 2026 production guidance. Even on friday the physical silver premium in shanghai was over $20. 2026 like its predecessor years will be marred by shortfall in silver supply unable to match the demand forecasts. 2 - another major trigger for Friday’s price action was obviously announcement of Kevin Warsh as fed pick. Markets have immediately perceived him as an interest rate hawk on balance based on his previous positioning. I think we are underestimating trump’s push for lower interest rates and the extent he went to pressure powell in aligning to his agendas. Its unthinkable that Trump wouldn’t have covered base with Kevin Warsh on what is expected of the next fed chair. 3 - yet another technical trigger for Friday’s price action was change in margin rules by CME on silver and gold contracts. I think this was the primary reason more than any other for the violent unwinding of the leverage trade in precious metals. Precious metals may not reclaim the ATHs anytime soon but I don’t think the story is over. I think the debasement trade, multi polar world order leading to uncertain geopolitical setup( potential iran attack, trumps impulsive trade wars) are still in play and will be for quite some time which in turn will keep SLV and GLD up and center.",

      "selftext": "I can't tell you how stressful this entire experience has been. Some of you remember my Intel position - I had worked my way back from being down 95% into 39k, netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings. Once I made my original investment back, I went full regard and did some VERY aggressive futures options trades with gold/silver/oil/nasdaq. Here we are, and I'm still in disbelief when I check the account total. I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude. I'm now trading nat gas (probably too big of a position), but no aggressive trades and definitely no more 0 DTE I just want to say: if you're down big atm, there's still a chance. It isn't going to be easy (I've spent every day/night hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets) but there's a chance you can come back. None of this is worth the stress though. That post-nut clarity once you've made it back is pretty sick though. \\[the large P/L for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $4900 on Friday - as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x...believe it or not those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $4700.\\]",

      "selftext": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates. Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2% at 2% inflation, President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1%, presumably around the middle of 2026 (I will explain why soon). Economics tells us, however, that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively, you need the stock market to drop, and quite hard. This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs, it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly, providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone, causing inflation to jump very quickly - potentially out of control. Of course, if you're cutting rates from the rather high 4.5% to the still high 3.75%, it isn't going to cause these issues, especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now, but the extreme 1% will not work the same. These factors, and more evidence which I will present here, leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop. Because isn't it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st (and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies), Trump announced the new Fed Chair, and the Epstein files were released (and some Iran news). Even more interesting, according to Business Insider, the Dow, on average, drops 15% after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair. February 1st was also the exact day that Trump would've pushed 10% tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise - and guess what? The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1. I don't believe it's a coincidence, but even if you do, we've had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 - hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic. Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he would've raised the tariffs by another 15%, ultimately leading me to believe June and July - after perhaps a 15-20% drop which would not surprise me - will be the bottom of this incoming bear market, and the time where rates will be cut to 1%. So, what do you think of this? Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not make it overly political. Thanks! Oh, and be careful bulls!",

      "selftext_processed": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates . Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2 % at 2 % inflation President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1 % presumably around the middle of 2026 I will explain why soon . Economics tells us however that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively you need the stock market to drop and quite hard . This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone causing inflation to jump very quickly potentially out of control . Of course if youre cutting rates from the rather high 4.5 % to the still high 3.75 % it isnt going to cause these issues especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now but the extreme 1 % will not_work the same . These factors and more evidence which I will present here leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop . Because isnt it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies Trump announced the new Fed Chair and the Epstein files were released and some Iran news . Even more interesting according to Business Insider the Dow on average drops 15 % after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair . February 1st was also the exact day that Trump wouldve pushed 10 % tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise and guess what The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1 . I dont believe its a coincidence but even if you do weve had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic . Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he wouldve raised the tariffs by another 15 % ultimately leading me to believe June and July after perhaps a 1520 % drop which would not_surprise me will be the bottom of this incoming bear market and the time where rates will be cut to 1 % . So what do you think of this Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not_make it overly political . Thanks Oh and be careful bulls"

Here’s my question however, I’m not super knowledgeable about the stock market but I’ve always been curious about investing my money myself and crypto has also spiked my interest a few times, I have a broker who invests the 300 dollars a month for me, he’s a family friend so I know him personally and he’s been doing this for a very long time. I’ve thought about opening my own Wealth Simple tfsa so I can put some money into that every month and invest myself into stock and etf, etc myself. Is it better to just keep letting my broker do it himself or should I contribute 200 or so a month into my Wealth Simple so I can invest myself. I know that was a bit to read and getting to the question took a bit but I wanted to not leave out any info lol. Thanks everyone !",

This is not an area of expertise for me so my best guess is that the corporation the stocks represent are \"forced\" to buy them back? Because if you're selling off stocks you're getting paid for their value. So where is that value coming from? Thanks in advanced for constructive on-topic replies.",

Who buys these freefalling stocks for more money than theyre going to be worth one minute later Who buys those freefalling stocks The obvious part is that no_one in their right mind would buy a stock high knowing that itll lose them money . This is not_an area of expertise for me so my best guess is that the corporation the stocks represent are forced to buy them back Because if youre selling off stocks youre getting paid for their value .

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a Nu holder and wanted to share an experience from a close friend in Brazil who recently decided to use Nu’s app to buy stocks instead of a traditional broker. Honestly, the experience sounds pretty rough. Some of the main issues he ran into: - You can only buy full shares (no fractional shares at all); - He placed a sell order during market hours, but the cash from the sale didn’t show up immediately in his account; - No live stock prices, you can’t really track price movements in real time; - Very limited information on the stocks (no depth, no proper charts, no context); - App navigation is Portuguese-only, no language flexibility; - The app feels cluttered with ads pushing credit products and services; - Buying and selling stocks doesn’t feel smooth or intuitive at all. This made me wonder: Is Nu treating stock investing as a serious long-term product, or just a secondary feature to cross-sell credit and banking services? As investors, we often focus on: user growth, engagement, ecosystem expansion. But product quality matters, especially if Nu wants to keep users inside its platform instead of losing them to real brokers. For those in Brazil actually using Nu Invest: Has this been your experience too? Has it improved recently? Do you still use it, or did you move to another platform? Curious to hear real user feedback, especially from locals.",

      "selftext": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago. I was/am very ignorant of investing. One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees. I looked through my statements and saw around $300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025. That's around $1200 a year in fees! I checked 2021-2024 and it was only a $40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief. I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year. I don't think the advisor did anything shady. They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didn't ask enough questions about it. My friend also made me aware of all the \"invisible\" fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades. So now I'm looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees. I'm considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3% match for IRA transfers and contributions, or Fidelity since that's what my 401k is in and it'd be nice to have it all in once place. I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH, not withdraw what I already have. Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages? I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake. Next. Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself, I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in. I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had high(er) expense ratios. My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped. I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds. The split would be 80% stock(US and Foreign) and 20% bonds. Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that I've done. I'm not looking to do anything fancy or game the market. I'm just going to max my contribution each year, then sit and hold for 30 years. Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above? Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA, then selling everything my advisor had me in, then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup. I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first. I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications? Any help is appreciated.",

      "selftext_processed": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago . I wasam very ignorant of investing . One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees . I looked through my statements and saw around $ 300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025 . Thats around $ 1200 a year in fees I checked 20212024 and it was only a $ 40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief . I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year . I dont think the advisor did anything shady . They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didnt ask enough questions about it . My friend also made me aware of all the invisible fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades . So now Im looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees . Im considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3 % match for IRA transfers and contributions or Fidelity since thats what my 401k is in and itd be nice to have it all in once place . I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH not_withdraw what I already have . Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake . Next . Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in . I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had higher expense ratios . My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped . I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds . The split would be 80 % stockUS and Foreign and 20 % bonds . Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that Ive done . Im not_looking to do anything fancy or game the market . Im just going to max my contribution each year then sit and hold for 30 years . Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA then selling everything my advisor had me in then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup . I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first . I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications Any help is appreciated ."

But their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine is quietly growing and giving Coke another unique competitive advantage. These freestyle machines can give consumers multiple choices of drinks and the ability to mix multiple drinks. But not everyone realises this has made Coca-Cola hundreds of millions or more. This machine helps Coca-Cola know what favours people are using the most which means they know what drinks work and they can promote it. Saving on marketing costs as they know what to focus on. Also with people mixing drinks it can give Coca-Cola ideas for new drinks which can also help grow the business But what’s your thoughts? Thanks for reading",

But their CocaCola Freestyle machine is quietly growing and giving Coke another unique competitive advantage . These freestyle machines can give consumers multiple choices of drinks and the ability to mix multiple drinks . But not_everyone realises this has made CocaCola hundreds of millions or more . This machine helps CocaCola know what favours people are using the most which means they know what drinks work and they can promote it . Saving on marketing costs as they know what to focus on . Also with people mixing drinks it can give CocaCola ideas for new drinks which can also help grow the business But what ’ s your thoughts Thanks for reading"

From what I see, I basically have two options: Option 1: Just stay with Revolut and keep investing there, since I’m already paying for Metal anyway. Option 2: Slowly move out: • Each month, sell a position using my free trades • Reinvest that money into Trading 212 • Stop adding new money to Revolut and only fund 212 going forward Transferring everything at once isn’t really an option, because Revolut charges €35 per stock for transfers.

I’ve tried investing a few times before, nothing serious. Small amounts, short periods. My dad was a gambling addict, so I’m very aware of that risk and I really don’t want to go down that road. Still, for some reason I’m decent at reading the market, waiting, not panicking. At least so far. In the past, the most I ever made was maybe €400 or €500. This time was different. With the market the way it is and some lucky decisions, I ended up turning that €100 into about €4,500 in a week and a half. I’m grateful, obviously. That money actually matters in my life and gives me some breathing room. But I also feel weird about it. Almost guilty. It makes my normal work feel pointless. I work my hours, I do side jobs, I try to improve my situation slowly… and then this happens, and it feels completely disconnected from effort or value. The market feels real and fake at the same time. Aggressive, almost brutal. Like you’re winning only because someone else is losing. I don’t know. I didn’t expect the money to bother me this much, but it does",

      "title": "How to filter Insider Trading data: Why buying high is actually a stronger signal than buying low",
      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer analysis, so I will try to explain my strategy at once** Okay, so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals, better data, and direct lines to management. Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However, there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours: SEC Form 4 Filings. I’ve spent the last few months (during my masters degree) refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity. I’m not talking about following politicians. I’m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it’s public. Below is the framework I use to filter this data, backed by academic research that explains *why* this works. # The Signal: The \"Cluster Buy\" A single insider buying stock can mean anything. They might be saving face, diversifying, or just optimistic. It’s noisy data. The real signal is the **Cluster Buy**. This occurs when **three or more unique insiders** purchase stock on the open market within a short window (usually <30 days). * **Why it matters:** Research by Alldredge and Blank (2019) confirms that insiders \"herd\" with their colleagues. They found an insider is nearly **four times more likely** to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently * **The Hierarchy:** Not all clusters are equal. Clusters led by **CFOs and Directors** exhibit the highest subsequent returns. The CFO knows the numbers; Directors see the strategy. When they move together, it’s a high-conviction signal. # The Filter: Ignoring the Noise 90% of insider transactions are noise. To find the alpha, you have to filter aggressively. Here are the three specific filters I use: **1. Ignore \"Routine\" Trades** We are looking for **Opportunistic Traders**. If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons, that trade contains zero information. You want to see trades that break a pattern. **2. The \"Buy High\" Anomaly** Conventional wisdom says \"buy low.\" However, research by Li, Wang, Yan, and Zhang (2019) uncovered a powerful anomaly: **Insiders who buy at 52-week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52-week lows**. * **The Logic:** This is called overcoming \"Anchoring Bias.\" Psychologically, it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30%. If an insider buys at a 52-week high, they are fighting human nature. They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher. A \"High Buy\" is a massive confidence signal. **3. The \"Not-Sold\" Signal** Sometimes the best signal is what insiders *don't* do. DeVault, Cederburg, and Wang (2021) analyzed **Portfolio Insiders** (directors who sit on multiple boards). * **The Signal:** If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B, and they sell Company A but **hold** Company B, the \"Not-Sold\" stock (Company B) significantly outperforms the market. If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock, check if those insiders are selling their *other* holdings to fund it. That doubles the conviction. # The Execution: Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one. Execution is where you make or lose money. **Rule 1: Wait for Price Confirmation** Insiders are notoriously early. They are value investors with infinite time horizons. You are not. * **My Trigger:** I wait for the stock to **reclaim the average price** of the insider's purchase. * **The Logic:** If the CFO buys at $50 and the stock drops to $40, the market disagrees with him. I stay away. When the stock rallies back through $50, it confirms the \"Insider Floor\" is holding and momentum is aligning with the insider's view. **Rule 2: Focus on Liquid Stocks** Paradoxically, insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks. Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume. A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks. **Rule 3: The \"Silent\" Exit** Retail investors usually sell too early or too late. I watch the insiders. If they stop buying during a subsequent dip, or if they start \"Routine\" selling into strength, the edge is gone. # Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash (especially at 52-week highs) it is the purest signal of value you can find. I track these **Cluster Buys** and publish a deep-dive watchlist of the most significant ones every week.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer analysis so I will try to explain my strategy at once Okay so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals better data and direct lines to management . Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours SEC Form 4 Filings . I ’ ve spent the last few months during my masters degree refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity . I ’ m not_talking about following politicians . I ’ m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it ’ s public . Below is the framework I use to filter this data backed by academic research that explains why this works . The Signal The Cluster Buy A single insider buying stock can mean anything . They might be saving face diversifying or just optimistic . It ’ s noisy data . The real signal is the Cluster Buy . This occurs when three or more unique insiders purchase stock on the open market within a short window usually 30 days . Why it matters Research by Alldredge and Blank 2019 confirms that insiders herd with their colleagues . They found an insider is nearly four times more likely to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently The Hierarchy Not_all clusters are equal . Clusters led by CFOs and Directors exhibit the highest subsequent returns . The CFO knows the numbers Directors see the strategy . When they move together it ’ s a highconviction signal . The Filter Ignoring the Noise 90 % of insider transactions are noise . To find the alpha you have to filter aggressively . Here are the three specific filters I use 1 . Ignore Routine Trades We are looking for Opportunistic Traders . If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons that trade contains zero information . You want to see trades that break a pattern . 2 . The Buy High Anomaly Conventional wisdom says buy low . However research by Li Wang Yan and Zhang 2019 uncovered a powerful anomaly Insiders who buy at 52week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52week lows . The Logic This is called overcoming Anchoring Bias . Psychologically it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30 % . If an insider buys at a 52week high they are fighting human nature . They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher . A High Buy is a massive confidence signal . 3 . The NotSold Signal Sometimes the best signal is what insiders dont do . DeVault Cederburg and Wang 2021 analyzed Portfolio Insiders directors who sit on multiple boards . The Signal If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B and they sell Company A but hold Company B the NotSold stock Company B significantly outperforms the market . If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock check if those insiders are selling their other holdings to fund it . That doubles the conviction . The Execution Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one . Execution is where you make or lose money . Rule 1 Wait for Price Confirmation Insiders are notoriously early . They are value investors with infinite time horizons . You are not_ My Trigger I wait for the stock to reclaim the average price of the insiders purchase . The Logic If the CFO buys at $ 50 and the stock drops to $ 40 the market disagrees with him . I stay away . When the stock rallies back through $ 50 it confirms the Insider Floor is holding and momentum is aligning with the insiders view . Rule 2 Focus on Liquid Stocks Paradoxically insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks . Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume . A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks . Rule 3 The Silent Exit Retail investors usually sell too early or too late . I watch the insiders . If they stop buying during a subsequent dip or if they start Routine selling into strength the edge is gone . Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash especially at 52week highs it is the purest signal of value you can find . I track these Cluster Buys and publish a deepdive watchlist of the most significant ones every week ."

      "title": "GlobalFoundries $GFS has 101.25% Institutional Ownerships with 11.66% of the float short.",
      "selftext": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th, the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips, for $20B, that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them, which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $GFS, who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics, the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq. What left me dumbfounded, is why $GFS was trading flat on the news for the week, and looking deeper into the stock, I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th, a week before Nvidia buying Groq, there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares, that barely moved the stock at all on that date, wtf… I know Quad-witching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that don't necessarily affect the stock, but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock’s volume on Quad-witching… So, putting two and two together, someone *probably* knew Nvidia was buying Groq, and they used the Quad-Witching date to load the f’king boat on GlobalFoundries. A week after the Groq acquisition, $GFS finally started climbing rapidly, from $35, to over $48 on January 27th, before pulling back to its current price of $42.20. Why the curious delayed reaction to the move? I believe, because this stock is shorted to the gills, and *someone* can’t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out. One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $GFS is currently shorted, Institutions hold 101.25% of the float, while a whopping 11.66% of that float is short, which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi’s… For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month. One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M! Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post. Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself. That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS. To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \\[OBV\\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month! $GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger……….. As always, this is not Financial Advice, don't blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet, this is all PURE speculation on my part. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** From u/Independent-Exam1863 comment below, the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with it's GR00Ts Robotics program. It all starts to make sense with $GFS acquisition of MIPS & Synopsis, who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI; with their acquisition $GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips. **\\[\\*\\*\\*\\*UPDATE 2\\*\\*\\*\\*\\]** Well, holy shit, I should've dug deeper into this, Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis!",

      "selftext_processed": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips for $ 20B that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $ GFS who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq . What left me dumbfounded is why $ GFS was trading flat on the news for the week and looking deeper into the stock I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th a week before Nvidia buying Groq there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares that barely moved the stock at all on that date wtf… I know Quadwitching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that dont necessarily affect the stock but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock ’ s volume on Quadwitching… So putting two and two together someone probably knew Nvidia was buying Groq and they used the QuadWitching date to load the f ’ king boat on GlobalFoundries . A week after the Groq acquisition $ GFS finally started climbing rapidly from $ 35 to over $ 48 on January 27th before pulling back to its current price of $ 42.20 . Why the curious delayed reaction to the move I believe because this stock is shorted to the gills and someone can ’ t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out . One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $ GFS is currently shorted Institutions hold 101.25 % of the float while a whopping 11.66 % of that float is short which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi ’ s… For more confirmation that $ GFS is dangerously shorted on Dec 31st just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $ 35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere_downgrading the stock and dropping the stock nearly 4 % on the day instead of continuing its plunge Bulls smelled blood in the water and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $ 48 in less than a month . One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 41726 $ 45 Calls for $ 5.2M then sold it for $ 14.2M on the price surge and then doubled down with 417 $ 55 Calls for nearly $ 10M Clearly they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 211 and that brings me to my first point of this post . Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI so they spent $ 20B on Groq AI Chips and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips if you ’ re Nvidia you ’ re not_gonna spend $ 20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips so the next logical investment for $ NVDA is to buy a stake in $ GFS itself . That MUST be what that Options Whale is betting on maybe an announcement on 211 earnings and with $ GFS so heavily shorted this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $ NVDA does intend to invest in $ GFS . To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries below is the Daily OnBalance Volume OBV chart ignore all those black lines in the middle those are my Intraday trendlines the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure to nearly hitting its Dec ’ 22 ATHs before pulling back but still staying above the Gann Fan and breaking that downward trend in just a single month $ GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options I believe Longs are betting on a run soon with or without $ NVDA buying a stake in $ GFS AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in . My position is 9 July 17th $ 45 Calls wish my account were bigger……… .. As always this is not_Financial Advice dont blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet this is all PURE speculation on my part . UPDATE From uIndependentExam1863 comment below the huge surge in Volume and Options seen in GlobalFoundries the past month may more be related to a potential partnership with Nvidia with its GR00Ts Robotics program . It all starts to make sense with $ GFS acquisition of MIPS Synopsis who would both be key in building Edge AI processors and sensors for Robotics and Physical AI with their acquisition $ GFS can provide a one stop shop solution for Nvidia for Edge AI chips to work with their own GPU chips . UPDATE 2 Well holy shit I shouldve dug deeper into this Nvidia already has a Partnership with Synopsis"

Musk's satellite-based internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver, accounting for about 50% to 80% of the total, the people said. >The rapid launch of 9,500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the world's largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service. The internet service, along with government contracts associated with Starlink and military-grade satellite network Starshield, has generated key revenue to help fund development of the company's next-generation Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit. >The company bought $19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the direct-to-device market, in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal. >The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world, close to Musk's 55th birthday ‍on June 28, the ⁠people said. >Musk expects Starship, which has test-launched 11 times since 2023, to start launching payloads into space this year. The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠space-based AI data centers, a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the company's proposed merger with xAI.",

SpaceXs most recent ‌financials which have not_been previously reported led some banks to estimate that the company could raise more than $ 50 billion at a valuation exceeding $ 1.5 trillion said the people who asked not_to be named to discuss private conversations . Reuters reported on Thursday that SpaceX is also in talks with ⁠Musk ’ s artificial intelligence company xAI XAAI.PVT ‌about a merger ahead of the IPO . SpaceX did not_immediately return a request for comment . The profit figure was earnings before interest taxes depreciation and ‍amortization a key measure of operating performance . Musks satellitebased internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver accounting for about 50 % to 80 % of the total the people said . The rapid launch of 9500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the worlds largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service . The internet service along with government contracts associated with Starlink and militarygrade satellite network Starshield has generated key revenue to help fund development of the companys nextgeneration Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit . The company bought $ 19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the directtodevice market in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal . The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world close to Musks 55th birthday ‍on June 28 the ⁠people said . Musk expects Starship which has testlaunched 11 times since 2023 to start launching payloads into space this year . The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠spacebased AI data centers a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the companys proposed merger with xAI ."

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, staying fully invested is often treated as the default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over long horizons, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally maintain a degree of flexibility through modest allocations to cash or short-duration assets. This can allow rebalancing, deployment during drawdowns, or reduced forced selling during periods of market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it may also affect risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is structured and used. From a portfolio construction standpoint, how do you think about this tradeoff? Do you view flexibility as a form of risk management, or as an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? How do you approach this in practice over full market cycles.?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction staying fully invested is often treated as the default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over long horizons idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally maintain a degree of flexibility through modest allocations to cash or shortduration assets . This can allow rebalancing deployment during drawdowns or reduced forced selling during periods of market stress . While this approach may lower expected returns it may also affect riskadjusted outcomes depending on how it is structured and used . From a portfolio construction standpoint how do you think about this tradeoff Do you view flexibility as a form of risk management or as an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize How do you approach this in practice over full market cycles ."

      "selftext": "**TL,DR/Summary:** Today, the silver price dropped \\~30%, an event unseen in about 15 years. This may not be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9% and/or Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair. A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in today's sell-off. I gathered a timeline of recent events before today's historic crash in silver price. I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the US-dollar index gaining 0.9% is at least incomplete (and at most a smokescreen). **Timeline** * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group switches from a fixed-dollar margin per contract to a 9% percentage margin ([PDF source]( Hence, traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group announces new 100-ounce **cash-settled** futures * 27 Jan 2026: CME group increases the margin requirement from 9% to 11% ([PDF source]( forcing more traders to liquidate * 28 Jan 2026: ex-JPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50% drop in silver price ([source]( JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF * 29 Jan 2026: Still, silver hits an all time high at around $121 * 30 Jan 2026: Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair, and the USD index gains 0.9%. This is the narrative for silver plummeting \\~30% in one day. However, historically, hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere near a comparable sell-off **The COMEX Physical Silver Problem** CME group, as of 30 Jan 2026, reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces ([Silver Stocks Excel file]( The March silver future open interest, however, is roughly 490m ounces (source: [open interest 98k](#tradeDate=20260129), where each contract is for 5k ounces). Hence, it will be disastrous for COMEX if \\~22% of March future holders demand physical delivery. They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions. Likewise, bullion banks that sold these future contracts (and are short silver), would be able to maintain their short positions, avoid catastrophic losses, and gain massively. I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash. What's your take on this, and what does it mean for the silver price? Cheers -",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDRSummary Today the silver price dropped 30 % an event unseen in about 15 years . This may not_be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9 % andor Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair . A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in todays selloff . I gathered a timeline of recent events before todays historic crash in silver price . I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the USdollar index gaining 0.9 % is at least incomplete and at most a smokescreen . Timeline 13 Jan 2026 CME Group switches from a fixeddollar margin per contract to a 9 % percentage margin PDF source Hence traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price 13 Jan 2026 CME Group announces new 100ounce cashsettled futures 27 Jan 2026 CME group increases the margin requirement from 9 % to 11 % PDF source forcing more traders to liquidate 28 Jan 2026 exJPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50 % drop in silver price source JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF 29 Jan 2026 Still silver hits an all time high at around $ 121 30 Jan 2026 Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair and the USD index gains 0.9 % . This is the narrative for silver plummeting 30 % in one day . However historically hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere_near a comparable selloff The COMEX Physical Silver Problem CME group as of 30 Jan 2026 reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces Silver Stocks Excel file The March silver future open interest however is roughly 490m ounces source open interest 98ktrade Date20260129 where each contract is for 5k ounces . Hence it will be disastrous for COMEX if 22 % of March future holders demand physical delivery . They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions . Likewise bullion banks that sold these future contracts and are short silver would be able to maintain their short positions avoid catastrophic losses and gain massively . I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash . Whats your take on this and what does it mean for the silver price Cheers"

I've done moderately well this past year, mostly just the market doing what it's doing, but I've made a few good choices and some other \"learning experiences\" I'm wondering, how can I improve my strategy for stop losses while capitalizing on the greatest amount of gain possible? I don't have the time or commitment to watch my holdings every minute. I want to have a better system of when I enter a position, setting up appropriate stops and also conditional trades so that I can take advantage of upswings but don't get burnt by sell offs. Is it advisable strategy to set up conditional trades such as this: if you enter at $100 for example, set up a cobditional trade such that if the stock dips past - 3% below it's 30-day high, it triggers a market sale. Something like that? Or what conditional trades do you use when you enter a position?",

      "selftext": "Briefings from Goldman Sachs: Gold has capped off a huge 2025 rally with a blazing start to 2026. While prices declined in early trading on Friday, Anshul Sehgal, global co-head of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, says the precious metal could continue to rise. The main driver of the move has been global central banks’ shift from the US dollar to precious metals, Sehgal says. “These are tiny markets compared to global stocks or fixed income, so the smallest change in demand makes prices go parabolic. Sehgal that only about 5% of the world’s gold is currently held by speculators. “If a central bank decides they want to pivot away from the dollar and own more gold, that is going to move the price quite violently. Which is what we're observing.” For this reason, Sehgal is skeptical of arguments that gold is currently being driven by speculative mania. “We think this is a multi-decade trajectory,\" he says. He adds that gold “barely moved” from 2010 to 2020 even as growth-oriented stocks surged, which means the recent move can partially be categorized as a catch-up. “Do we expect gold to continue to appreciate exponentially as it has? No. But we’re not fussed about there being a lot of froth when it comes to precious metals,” he says.",

I have found adding money is far easier than selling investments. I have bought into the market in every crash from 1995 onwards without selling anything. Currently about 98% Stocks. So better to sell equally, sell the best performers, sell the slow performers, sell the lowest tax problems. My original plan was to die so the family get stepped up basis, but it seems I may live longer than I thought,",

I have found adding money is far easier than selling investments . I have bought into the market in every crash from 1995 onwards without selling anything . Currently about 98 % Stocks . So better to sell equally sell the best performers sell the slow performers sell the lowest tax problems . My original plan was to die so the family get stepped up basis but it seems I may live longer than I thought"

Possible catalysts: \\- new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar \\- iran war de-escalation \\- unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation: the price is the consensus reached by many different players, most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading. They either panic sold or got margin called, deepening the crash. In the Asian market however, there are institutions and governments who have a strategic or long term reason to buy, especially when they get a discount. They will be voting and primary driver of the monday opening price (since time zone is ahead for asia). So I am expecting a gap up and I bought both GLD and SLV calls right before close on Friday. TL;DR: US specular’s job is to predict the asian metal market driven by fundamentals, so large moves during nyse trading hours are a false signal, serious price discovery is going to happen with American markets closed.

      "selftext": "Been digging into Microsoft's financials beyond the usual revenue and EPS numbers, and wanted to share some observations that caught my attention from a value perspective. I used \\[thefinbase\\]( to pull together this data for my risk analysis before I buy this stock and \\[tradingview\\]( for financial information it has the best UI . No affiliation with these two just revealing my sources. Now let’s get going: Balance Sheet Shifting Toward Less Flexible Assets Property, plant, and equipment increased nearly 50% in a single year (from \\\\\\~$155B to \\\\\\~$230B). That's a massive tilt toward long duration, non liquid assets. Meanwhile, depreciation jumped from $22B to $34B. In a sector where hardware can become obsolete quickly, this concentration in physical infrastructure creates impairment exposure if tech refresh cycles accelerate. Some Interesting Liability Movement \"Other Current Liabilities\" increased 45% year over year. Without detailed disclosure, this likely includes unearned cloud billings and similar obligations. Worth monitoring because rapid buildup in prepayment dependency can distort cash flow timing if customer behavior shifts. The Segment Concentration Factor Intelligent Cloud now drives roughly 40% of revenue with 29% growth, while More Personal Computing actually declined 3%. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean any cloud cyclicality hits the overall business harder than it would have five years ago. The Sentiment Disconnect Despite record profits, shares declined after strong Q2 results. When markets sell the news on beat and raise quarters, it often signals expectations have gotten ahead of near term reality. None of this means the investment thesis is broken. Microsoft remains a dominant business. But as value investors, we're supposed to see what others miss and understand what we're actually paying for at current multiples. Even with these risks I still think it's a good stock to buy, especially in its role as the AI boom continues. What do you think ?",

      "selftext_processed": "Been digging into Microsofts financials beyond the usual revenue and EPS numbers and wanted to share some observations that caught my attention from a value perspective . I used thefinbase to pull together this data for my risk analysis before I buy this stock and tradingview for financial information it has the best UI . No_affiliation with these two just revealing my sources . Now let ’ s get going Balance Sheet Shifting Toward Less Flexible Assets Property plant and equipment increased nearly 50 % in a single year from $ 155B to $ 230B . Thats a massive tilt toward long duration non liquid assets . Meanwhile depreciation jumped from $ 22B to $ 34B . In a sector where hardware can become obsolete quickly this concentration in physical infrastructure creates impairment exposure if tech refresh cycles accelerate . Some Interesting Liability Movement Other Current Liabilities increased 45 % year over year . Without detailed disclosure this likely includes unearned cloud billings and similar obligations . Worth monitoring because rapid buildup in prepayment dependency can distort cash flow timing if customer behavior shifts . The Segment Concentration Factor Intelligent Cloud now drives roughly 40 % of revenue with 29 % growth while More Personal Computing actually declined 3 % . This isnt necessarily bad but it does mean any cloud cyclicality hits the overall business harder than it would have five years ago . The Sentiment Disconnect Despite record profits shares declined after strong Q2 results . When markets sell the news on beat and raise quarters it often signals expectations have gotten ahead of near term reality . None of this means the investment thesis is broken . Microsoft remains a dominant business . But as value investors were supposed to see what others miss and understand what were actually paying for at current multiples . Even with these risks I still think its a good stock to buy especially in its role as the AI boom continues . What do you think"

      "selftext": "I am an ignorant anonymous, I surely know less than you, but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today. **What happened today?** Everything went to shit: gold, silver, major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit. **What does this mean?** The market received a necessary correction. After gold and silver rose savagely these days, a lot of last-minute leveraged money was absorbed. I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop: 1. **Options Expiration:** Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed. With gold at **5,500 USD**, profit-taking was factual. Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits, and thus generated downward pressure. 2. **Trump's move with Kevin Warsh:** Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed. On paper, he is a \"HAWK\" (strong dollar, high rates, and low inflation). That's why the market ran to bonds and punished stocks/gold for fear of liquidity being cut. **My opinion:** Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not long ago. For me, Warsh is a puppet: they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House. Under this thesis, when he comes to power in May, Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending. The dollar will continue to lose value, gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks, and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate (congratulations if you held emerging market bonds). But if you don't believe me even in the worst-case scenario, boys: the decay of Fiat is not fixed with a change of names. Hold your equities and don't let yourselves be scared.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am an ignorant anonymous I surely know less than you but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today . What happened today Everything went to shit gold silver major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit . What does this mean The market received a necessary correction . After gold and silver rose savagely these days a lot of lastminute leveraged money was absorbed . I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop 1 . Options Expiration Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed . With gold at 5500 USD profittaking was factual . Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits and thus generated downward pressure . 2 . Trumps move with Kevin Warsh Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed . On paper he is a HAWK strong dollar high rates and low inflation . Thats why the market ran to bonds and punished stocksgold for fear of liquidity being cut . My opinion Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not_long ago . For me Warsh is a puppet they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no_longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House . Under this thesis when he comes to power in May Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending . The dollar will continue to lose value gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate congratulations if you held emerging market bonds . But if you dont believe me even in the worstcase scenario boys the decay of Fiat is not_fixed with a change of names . Hold your equities and dont let yourselves be scared ."

      "selftext": "When my husband died a few years ago, I became sole owner of his brokerage account. He was pretty casual about his stocks and didn't have the date of acquisition for many of them. He was a \"buy and hold\" guy, or \"inherit and hold.\" Upon my death, the account will go to a charity that was important to my husband. We were each other's second spouse. He had no children. I transfer regular earnings to my account and use the money for whatever I want -- living expenses, house repairs, investment. Occasionally, however, one of his stocks will disappear and leave a pile of money in the sweep account. (Yes, the company is acquired by another entity or whatever.) I take that money and invest in other stocks for his account, using my own research and recommendations from the brokerkage. Here's my question: Should I do some research to find out when he acquired the stocks for which I have no date of acquisition? If so, how would I do that? I know that he acquired some of the stocks in the Seventies, and some he probably had had since he was a child, so they are almost certainly considered long-term investments.

      "selftext": "Reddit (RDDT) stock has been pretty volatile lately after pulling back from a recent high, supposedly driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. There’s still a lot of bullish sentiment, with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $320 based on strong user growth and AI integration. *“… driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition.”* Competition from what exactly? TikTok? The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons? Or Snap? The app that’s been effectively dead for years? I’ll leave Meta out of this because I don’t think it even needs addressing. The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms. Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would’ve made more sense for a bullish case. Not sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things. Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher, showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair, Warsh. (Who knows, I’m not taking a stance there.) The point is, there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026, so how does that square with fears (atop of the previous points) of declining ad growth? Between Reddit ads, its growing presence in search results, AI integration, and highly targeted user interests, Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI. There’s also the new verified profile feature, which could end up being meaningful long-term, even for marketing purposes. All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me. There’s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which, honestly, should be another sign. Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5, 2026. I’ve recently been questioning that specific analyst, why there was such a reaction from it, but perhaps I had missed something on my end. **P.S.** To everyone about to yell “it’s nothing but bots!” Yeah, there are bots everywhere among all platforms. However, you’d be surprised how many users *aren’t* bots. This gives me the same energy as people saying “that must be AI!” when it clearly isn’t. Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now. I’ve watched people Google something, scroll straight past everything else, click the Reddit result to get their answer. They would also casually notice an ad while they’re there. That feels - important. **Edit:** I originally wrote this on the fly, but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point. I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below, which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one! **Edit:** There are many great points below. I agree with some of the concerns drawn, but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent, and very suddenly, selloff. **Edit:** I Love all the banbets below! Yep. I’m in for *banbet RDDT 195 1w.* I guess I’m riding with you, u/Sweg_OG",

There ’ s still a lot of bullish sentiment with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $ 320 based on strong user growth and AI integration . “ … driven by an analyst ’ s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. ” Competition from what exactly TikTok The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons Or Snap The app that ’ s been effectively dead for years I ’ ll leave Meta out of this because I don ’ t think it even needs addressing . The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms . Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would ’ ve made more sense for a bullish case . Not_sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things . Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair Warsh . Who knows I ’ m not_taking a stance there . The point is there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026 so how does that square with fears atop of the previous points of declining ad growth Between Reddit ads its growing presence in search results AI integration and highly targeted user interests Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI . There ’ s also the new verified profile feature which could end up being meaningful longterm even for marketing purposes . All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me . There ’ s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which honestly should be another sign . Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5 2026 . I ’ ve recently been questioning that specific analyst why there was such a reaction from it but perhaps I had missed something on my end . P.S . To everyone about to yell “ it ’ s nothing_but bots ” Yeah there are bots everywhere among all platforms . However you ’ d be surprised how many users aren ’ t bots . This gives me the same energy as people saying “ that must be AI ” when it clearly isn ’ t . Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now . I ’ ve watched people Google something scroll straight past everything else click the Reddit result to get their answer . They would also casually notice an ad while they ’ re there . That feels important . Edit I originally wrote this on the fly but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point . I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one Edit There are many great points below . I agree with some of the concerns drawn but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent and very suddenly selloff . Edit I Love all the banbets below Yep . I ’ m in for banbet RDDT 195 1w . I guess I ’ m riding with you uSweg_OG"

      "selftext": "I am from India and want to invest globally via IBKR. I am looking for non-US domiciled accumulating UCITs only for easier tax purposes. I researched and made this PF for me: 70% ACWX - Developed Markets ex usa + Emerging markets 30% CSPX - Similar to S&P500. With this my idea is to reduce US concentration in my PF because World ETFs include >60% US. But the issue is ACWX is Nasdaq based ETF. Is anyone aware of any other alternative UCITs for ACWX ?? I know I can replicate ACWX via/from EXUS + EIMI but that would require a little more monitoring down the line. ACWX would have served the purpose just right but the only issue is that it is US domiciled. TLDR; I have 2 questions: 1) Is there any ACWX alternative, non US domiciled UCIT on IBKR? 2) How do I buy gold on ibkr? best etf?",

      "title": "Trust investment claims outperformance vs indexes, looking for advice",
      "selftext": "I’m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I’m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense. Background: I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next \\~3 years. The trust is administered by a large, reputable law firm, and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates. From everything I can tell, this is a legitimate, professional setup and not anything sketchy. The trust uses an outside active equity manager. The proposed long-term allocation is roughly 80% equities and 20% cash (short-term needs), with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into \\~30–40 individual stocks. The stated goal is long-term investing with a “defensive” tilt: high-quality companies, low debt, strong balance sheets, some international exposure, and selective themes (e.g., infrastructure, electrification). The annual fee is \\~1.2% of the entire trust value (not just the invested portion). This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight. Trading costs are small, but the 1.2% applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash. I asked for historical performance, and I was shown a model trust portfolio (not my specific account) covering roughly 1998–2025. According to that report: • Total portfolio (stocks + bonds + cash): \\~8.3% annualized • Equity portion alone: \\~11.6% annualized Over the same period: • S&P 500: \\~9.4% • MSCI World: \\~8.3% The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes, while also being more defensive. However, once I factor in the 1.2% annual fee on the full trust, the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly \\~7.1%. That puts it roughly in line with (or slightly below) a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio, and clearly below the S&P 500 over the same horizon. Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach: • Index funds are “not necessarily low risk” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks. • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration. • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure. • The strategy has historically “participated less” during market declines. My concerns: • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing long-term risk. • The performance shown is from a model portfolio, which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias. • The equity outperformance looks good gross, but once the full trust fee is applied, it largely disappears. • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk, it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result. • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years, I’m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the long-term portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases. I’m not claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here. The trustee is experienced, properly credentialed, and works at a well-known firm. My question is more about the math and the assumptions. For those with experience in investing, finance, or trusts: • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test? • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this? • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns? • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for? Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I ’ m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense . Background I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next 3 years . The trust is administered by a large reputable law firm and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates . From everything I can tell this is a legitimate professional setup and not_anything sketchy . The trust uses an outside active equity manager . The proposed longterm allocation is roughly 80 % equities and 20 % cash shortterm needs with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into 30–40 individual stocks . The stated goal is longterm investing with a “ defensive ” tilt highquality companies low debt strong balance sheets some international exposure and selective themes e.g . infrastructure electrification . The annual fee is 1.2 % of the entire trust value not just the invested portion . This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight . Trading costs are small but the 1.2 % applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash . I asked for historical performance and I was shown a model trust portfolio not my specific account covering roughly 1998–2025 . According to that report • Total portfolio stocks bonds cash 8.3 % annualized • Equity portion alone 11.6 % annualized Over the same period • SP 500 9.4 % • MSCI World 8.3 % The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes while also being more defensive . However once I factor in the 1.2 % annual fee on the full trust the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly 7.1 % . That puts it roughly in line with or slightly below a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio and clearly below the SP 500 over the same horizon . Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach • Index funds are “ not necessarily low risk ” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks . • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration . • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure . • The strategy has historically “ participated less ” during market declines . My concerns • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing longterm risk . • The performance shown is from a model portfolio which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias . • The equity outperformance looks good gross but once the full trust fee is applied it largely disappears . • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result . • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years I ’ m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the longterm portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases . I ’ m not_claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here . The trustee is experienced properly credentialed and works at a wellknown firm . My question is more about the math and the assumptions . For those with experience in investing finance or trusts • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives ."

      "title": "Dollar Crashing. My Criticism of Public Perception",
      "selftext": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this: The dollar has always been crashing, but it really depends on what frame of view by which you're looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you. That's where we can have a debate. As you know, we've seen headlines about the dollar collapse, and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends. But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider: What makes this 'crash' any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced? Here's what you'll see folks point to: \\- Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency. \\-Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights. \\-Recent inflation has been exceptional, where aggregate prices are 26% higher today than in 2019-2020. \\-The DXY, a measure of our currency relative to a basket of first-world nations, has come down considerably \\-Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control This is what I'd like to point to: Nothing changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new. let's look at the above talking points one-by-one. **1) Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency & 2) The DXY has come down considerably** In recent history, it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade. Is this new? No. The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline. We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar, as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was *artificially* being stymied. Just like the OPEC-mandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s, we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar. Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage. You may argue \"But did our money supply not increase??\". The answer is yes. It did. But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world. Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty. Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not seen in decades. It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized. The advent of Trump's tariffs, like him or not, did add some fuel to the fire. Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here. China being a large proponent to this. Overall, you'll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runner-up. **Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights** The price increases of Gold/Silver have been often misread as \"this must mean the value of the dollar is falling\", when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is self-fulfilling. If people believe the sky is falling, they'll buy bunkers. It's not that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling. I've already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver, so I'll not stay too long on this one, but I want to point out that in the coming months, you may see the price stagnate then climb higher. You may also see it come crashing back down. Both events are equally likely. Fundamentally, however, I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not led by central banking or any monetary authority. We can check money flows. When we do this, we find that A) there's already been an industrial shortage for silver and B) This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own. If you use fund inflows to exchange-traded products backed by gold and silver, you see they've gone up by 20-30 fold. That's not nothing. That's behavioral and not fundamental. But let's go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things: 1) **current and expected CPI** 2) **Long term treasury yields** \\-The CPI expectation hovers at 2.7-3.2%. This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 50-60 years. As for Long term treasury yield, we use this figure because I don't want to open myself up to someone saying \"Well, the fed has been buying treasuries, so that decreases yields\". They would be right, but 10 and 30-yr terms are the exception. Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates. If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally, we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30-yr terms, pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations. We'd also see a really difficult auction. We haven't seen either. Right now, yields are 160 Bps below the 60-year average, and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong; evidenced by the 'bid-to-cover' ratio, which is actually within a normal range at **2.55**. **Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control** THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely. Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending. As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases, it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand. I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change. However, some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable Debt/GDP ratio. This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically under-paces the rate in which we accumulate public debt. Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the \"Dollar Crash\" concern: QE (Quantitative Easing). QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits. This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks. **So where are we really?** It's complicated. And the news doesn't help. The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s. I'll not lie to you and say everything is okay, but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not going away. We have a real problem with debt. It's growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt, each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nation's treasury. But here's the detail we can't miss: Our economy is capitalistic, not communistic. In a capitalist country, the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace. And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money, that skews inflation recognition. Not for capital assets but for consumables. We've seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras. 1) the easy-money policy when debt was near 0%. 2) During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the top-end of the economy. Hence the K-shaped recovery. This created asset inflation, and we can call it asset inflation because of how P/E ratios, (adjusted for earnings growth), have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages. Some of this is structural. Companies, today, are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history. That can pull-forward tomorrow's pricing to today. But that's an incomplete story. If we look at capital assets, they've outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply. That's where the **dollar's value 'plunging'** shows up. This leads me back to my overall argument. The dollar crisis shows up depending on where you're looking. Capping it all off, I'll leave you with this scenario: Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim. And let's say I print off $10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself (I would). By every measure, M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50%, but does this mean the dollar's purchasing power has been cut by 1/3? No. It's the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollar's loss of purchasing power. If I started to then spend that $10 Trillion, buy all the food from the shelves, feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price I'm paying, then you'd see inflation. **The rule:** In a true currency crisis, you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transaction-related friction. For many countries, companies and individuals, that currency is still the US Dollar. When you have dollars, convert your savings into productive assets. Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery. No other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does.",

      "selftext_processed": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this The dollar has always been crashing but it really depends on what frame of view by which youre looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you . Thats where we can have a debate . As you know weve seen headlines about the dollar collapse and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends . But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider What makes this crash any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced Heres what youll see folks point to Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights . Recent inflation has been exceptional where aggregate prices are 26 % higher today than in 20192020 . The DXY a measure of our currency relative to a basket of firstworld nations has come down considerably Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control This is what Id like to point to Nothing_changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new . lets look at the above talking points onebyone . 1 Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency 2 The DXY has come down considerably In recent history it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade . Is this new No_The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline . We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was artificially being stymied . Just like the OPECmandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar . Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage . You may argue But did our money supply not_increase . The answer is yes . It did . But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world . Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty . Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not_seen in decades . It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized . The advent of Trumps tariffs like him or not_did add some fuel to the fire . Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here . China being a large proponent to this . Overall youll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runnerup . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights The price increases of GoldSilver have been often misread as this must mean the value of the dollar is falling when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is selffulfilling . If people believe the sky is falling theyll buy bunkers . Its not_that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling . Ive already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver so Ill not_stay too long on this one but I want to point out that in the coming months you may see the price stagnate then climb higher . You may also see it come crashing back down . Both events are equally likely . Fundamentally however I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not_led by central banking or any monetary authority . We can check money flows . When we do this we find that A theres already been an industrial shortage for silver and B This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own . If you use fund inflows to exchangetraded products backed by gold and silver you see theyve gone up by 2030 fold . Thats not_nothing . Thats behavioral and not_fundamental . But lets go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things 1 current and expected CPI 2 Long term treasury yields The CPI expectation hovers at 2.73.2 % . This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 5060 years . As for Long term treasury yield we use this figure because I dont want to open myself up to someone saying Well the fed has been buying treasuries so that decreases yields . They would be right but 10 and 30yr terms are the exception . Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates . If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30yr terms pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations . Wed also see a really difficult auction . We havent seen either . Right now yields are 160 Bps below the 60year average and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong evidenced by the bidtocover ratio which is actually within a normal range at 2.55 . Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely . Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending . As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand . I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change . However some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable DebtGDP ratio . This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically underpaces the rate in which we accumulate public debt . Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the Dollar Crash concern QE Quantitative Easing . QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits . This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks . So where are we really Its complicated . And the news doesnt help . The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s . Ill not_lie to you and say everything is okay but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not_going away . We have a real problem with debt . Its growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nations treasury . But heres the detail we cant miss Our economy is capitalistic not_communistic . In a capitalist country the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace . And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money that skews inflation recognition . Not_for capital assets but for consumables . Weve seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras . 1 the easymoney policy when debt was near 0 % . 2 During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the topend of the economy . Hence the Kshaped recovery . This created asset inflation and we can call it asset inflation because of how PE ratios adjusted for earnings growth have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages . Some of this is structural . Companies today are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history . That can pullforward tomorrows pricing to today . But thats an incomplete story . If we look at capital assets theyve outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply . Thats where the dollars value plunging shows up . This leads me back to my overall argument . The dollar crisis shows up depending on where youre looking . Capping it all off Ill leave you with this scenario Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim . And lets say I print off $ 10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself I would . By every measure M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50 % but does this mean the dollars purchasing power has been cut by 13 No_Its the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollars loss of purchasing power . If I started to then spend that $ 10 Trillion buy all the food from the shelves feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price Im paying then youd see inflation . The rule In a true currency crisis you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transactionrelated friction . For many countries companies and individuals that currency is still the US Dollar . When you have dollars convert your savings into productive assets . Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery . No_other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does ."

      "title": "The Math Behind \"Time Diversification\": Why 5 Years (60 Months) is the Statistical \"Magic Number\" for Equities",
      "selftext": "We often hear the standard advice: \"Own more bonds to stay safe.\" Or the classic \"100 minus your age\" rule. But as a data-focused analyst, I’ve always found the standard economic models (like Mean-Variance Optimization) frustrating because they fail to mathematically support long-term stock holding. Standard models penalize stocks for \"upside volatility,\" even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation. I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the *Journal of Finance* titled **\"Bond versus Stock: Investors' Age and Risk Taking\"** (Bali, Demirtas, Levy, Wolf). It uses a framework called **Almost Stochastic Dominance (ASD)** to prove that for rational investors, the \"risk\" of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon. Here is the breakdown of the data (covering U.S. markets 1941–2000): **1. The Short Run (1 Month) is a Coin Flip** If your horizon is 30 days, stocks are not \"investing\" but they are gambling. * **Dominance:** None. Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks beating bonds is only **\\~67%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" (the statistical likelihood of regret) is high at \\~28%. **2. The \"Efficiency\" Shift (48 Months)** The paper found that once you hold for 4 years, the efficient frontier shifts aggressively. * At a 48-month horizon, only portfolios with **80% or more equities** are considered efficient. * If you hold >20% bonds for a 4-year period, you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no rational utility gain. **3. The Magic Number (60 Months)** This is where the \"Time Diversification\" argument becomes irrefutable. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits **\\~98–99%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" shrinks to a negligible **0.24%**. **The Takeaway:** We often confuse \"Volatility\" with \"Risk.\" * In the short term (1 month), volatility IS risk. * In the long term (60 months), volatility is just the mechanism of compounding. If you have a 5-year horizon, \"playing it safe\" with heavy bond exposure isn't actually safe but it is mathematically irrational. So my question is, based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100% in stocks? :) **EDIT** **Hello Guys, based on some questions and discussions, I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section** **Q: \"Valuations (CAPE ratio) are too high. Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich.\"** **A:** While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower *magnitude* of returns (e.g., 4% vs 10%), they do not necessarily flip the *probability* of outperformance vs. bonds below 50% unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre-1990 accounting norms. Post-1990, structural changs (buybacks replacing dividends, capital-light tech) have shifted the normal CAPE range higher. Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha. **Q: \"The 'Stocks Always Win' thesis is Survivorship Bias. What about Japan or Russia?\"** **A:** Valid. The US market is the \"Empire that Won\". However, the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism, not just Ameican exceptionalism. The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification (buying \"The Rest of the World\"), not retreating to Cash or Bonds, which face their own risks (inflation/currency collapse). **Q: \"100% Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash.\"** **A:** Agreed. This is the difference between \"Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality. If holding 20% in bnds prevents an investor from panic-selling the other 80% during a drawdown, that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium, not an inefficiency. The best portfolio is the one you can stick with.",

      "selftext_processed": "We often hear the standard advice Own more bonds to stay safe . Or the classic 100 minus your age rule . But as a datafocused analyst I ’ ve always found the standard economic models like MeanVariance Optimization frustrating because they fail to mathematically support longterm stock holding . Standard models penalize stocks for upside volatility even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation . I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the Journal of Finance titled Bond versus Stock Investors Age and Risk Taking Bali Demirtas Levy Wolf . It uses a framework called Almost Stochastic Dominance ASD to prove that for rational investors the risk of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon . Here is the breakdown of the data covering U.S. markets 1941–2000 1 . The Short Run 1 Month is a Coin Flip If your horizon is 30 days stocks are not_investing but they are gambling . Dominance None . Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices . Win Rate The probability of stocks beating bonds is only 67 % . The Risk The violation area the statistical likelihood of regret is high at 28 % . 2 . The Efficiency Shift 48 Months The paper found that once you hold for 4 years the efficient frontier shifts aggressively . At a 48month horizon only portfolios with 80 % or more equities are considered efficient . If you hold 20 % bonds for a 4year period you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no_rational utility gain . 3 . The Magic Number 60 Months This is where the Time Diversification argument becomes irrefutable . Win Rate The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits 98–99 % . The Risk The violation area shrinks to a negligible 0.24 % . The Takeaway We often confuse Volatility with Risk . In the short term 1 month volatility IS risk . In the long term 60 months volatility is just the mechanism of compounding . If you have a 5year horizon playing it safe with heavy bond exposure isnt actually safe but it is mathematically irrational . So my question is based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100 % in stocks EDIT Hello Guys based on some questions and discussions I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section Q Valuations CAPE ratio are too high . Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich . A While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower magnitude of returns e.g . 4 % vs 10 % they do not_necessarily flip the probability of outperformance vs. bonds below 50 % unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre1990 accounting norms . Post1990 structural changs buybacks replacing dividends capitallight tech have shifted the normal CAPE range higher . Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha . Q The Stocks Always Win thesis is Survivorship Bias . What about Japan or Russia A Valid . The US market is the Empire that Won . However the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism not_just Ameican exceptionalism . The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification buying The Rest of the World not_retreating to Cash or Bonds which face their own risks inflationcurrency collapse . Q 100 % Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash . A Agreed . This is the difference between Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality . If holding 20 % in bnds prevents an investor from panicselling the other 80 % during a drawdown that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium not_an inefficiency . The best portfolio is the one you can stick with ."

The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and that's unlikely to change much with this report.

      "title": "More DD on Snapchat+ adoption after mandatory pay-for-storage changes",
      "selftext": "I received many DMs after my [first post]( about $SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected, so here it is. **BACKGROUND:** Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee. In-app prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat+. So I compiled data from 80 respondents (37k+ friends in total) to estimate Snap’s earning potential. **THE GOOD NEWS:** I remain confident that subscription-based revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter, which should result in \\~12.5% growth in run-rate revenue and \\~25% bump in enterprise value expectation (though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot) **THE BAD NEWS:** The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat+ subs will not be realized as Q4 revenue, but will instead build rapidly over the next year. This is because of **(1)** steep first-month signup discounts, **(2)** in-app prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter, and **(3)** the fact that “Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription” (from 10-Q). (That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won’t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4). Also, Apple’s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year. **METHOD:** (See Images 3 and 4) I broke down user count by age group and location (US, EU, INDIA/ROW) using DAU reports from the 10Q. I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics. I multiplied the two matrices together, summed to get a demographic-weighted average of DAUs who are subscribed, then multiplied by total DAUs. I also multiplied by a “Zombie factor” to account for inactive users on respondents’ friend lists. This leads me to the 100% increase figure with assumptions: * Of the average user’s friend list, 40% are DAU, 40% are MAU, and 20% are inactive. * People over age 35 (making up 30% of the user base) are completely ignored. * $2/mo subscription plans are completely ignored. **Assumption analysis** INDIA: India accounts for \\~40% of users, so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight. I spent 5 hours on Azar (like Omegle but more popular in India), but I couldn’t get a single Indian user to give me their data (though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat+). So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 1/10 of those in the US for the same age group. I think this is reasonable because Snapchat+ is 50 Rupees per month in India, corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity. DOUBLE-COUNTING: I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed (as opposed to the friend-count-weighted method I used in my first post). **NOTE:** Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low (0.29), so this may not be necessary. INACTIVE USERS: Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis. Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs , I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap+ per DAU metric. Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs. As a 21-year old, I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this: A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity. Also, criminals love Snapchat for self-deleting texts. Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends. **OTHER NOTES:** I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap+ friends. I attribute this to an error in sampling; these users assumed that, because they were sent to a different page than was shown, their Snap+ friend count must be 0. This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection. Snap doesn’t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q, instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards. I won’t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid. Schwab was showing me +$19k in (totally fake) unrealized P&L on Tuesday based on mid-to-market rates (the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x). If anyone knows how to change this, please comment below. **Safe to say I’m down a lot. But I haven’t sold anything.** Holding till Feb 4th. Cross your fingies for me. PS: See the raw data [Here]( I'd love to see your analysis! PPS: If you know any 35-yr-olds or Indians who use Snapchat, please ask them for their data and comment it below.",

      "selftext_processed": "I received many DMs after my first post about $ SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected so here it is . BACKGROUND Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee . Inapp prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat . So I compiled data from 80 respondents 37k friends in total to estimate Snap ’ s earning potential . THE GOOD NEWS I remain confident that subscriptionbased revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter which should result in 12.5 % growth in runrate revenue and 25 % bump in enterprise value expectation though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot THE BAD NEWS The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat subs will not_be realized as Q4 revenue but will instead build rapidly over the next year . This is because of 1 steep firstmonth signup discounts 2 inapp prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter and 3 the fact that “ Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription ” from 10Q . That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won ’ t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4 . Also Apple ’ s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year . METHOD See Images 3 and 4 I broke down user count by age group and location US EU INDIAROW using DAU reports from the 10Q . I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics . I multiplied the two matrices together summed to get a demographicweighted average of DAUs who are subscribed then multiplied by total DAUs . I also multiplied by a “ Zombie factor ” to account for inactive users on respondents ’ friend lists . This leads me to the 100 % increase figure with assumptions Of the average user ’ s friend list 40 % are DAU 40 % are MAU and 20 % are inactive . People over age 35 making up 30 % of the user base are completely ignored . $ 2mo subscription plans are completely ignored . Assumption analysis INDIA India accounts for 40 % of users so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight . I spent 5 hours on Azar like Omegle but more popular in India but I couldn ’ t get a single Indian user to give me their data though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat . So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 110 of those in the US for the same age group . I think this is reasonable because Snapchat is 50 Rupees per month in India corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $ 2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity . DOUBLECOUNTING I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed as opposed to the friendcountweighted method I used in my first post . NOTE Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low 0.29 so this may not_be necessary . INACTIVE USERS Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis . Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap per DAU metric . Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs . As a 21year old I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity . Also criminals love Snapchat for selfdeleting texts . Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends . OTHER NOTES I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap friends . I attribute this to an error in sampling these users assumed that because they were sent to a different page than was shown their Snap friend count must be 0 . This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection . Snap doesn ’ t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards . I won ’ t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid . Schwab was showing me $ 19k in totally fake unrealized PL on Tuesday based on midtomarket rates the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x . If anyone knows how to change this please comment below . Safe to say I ’ m down a lot . But I haven ’ t sold anything . Holding till Feb 4th . Cross your fingies for me . PS See the raw data Here Id love to see your analysis PPS If you know any 35yrolds or Indians who use Snapchat please ask them for their data and comment it below ."

I started betting on this whole memorystorage play around 16th of last december with 12k initial capital and Im sitting at roughly 90k now Im a college student from Turkey so this was a pretty big yolo and a pretty big gain for me planning on maybe continuing with around 16k on my speculative bets and just take the rest out into like a money market account or something just to be safe and not_gamble it away"

      "selftext": "Note: * Post title says 'surge' which is not accurate. It should be 'rebounded' * Gold -8% and silver -17% was at the lowest point in pre-market. Check the charts at the bottom of this post. Source: [ >Gold and silver suffered the biggest sell-off in years, in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that’s lifted prices to all-time highs. >Gold dropped as much as 8% to crash through $5,000 an ounce, while silver slumped below $100 as the sell-off swept through the broader metals markets. Copper dropped more than 3% in London, after surging above $14,000 a ton for the first time on Thursday, in its biggest intraday jump since 2008. >The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair. The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken. Chinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets. >Silver plunged more than 17% toward $95 an ounce, intensifying a period of extreme volatility that’s rocked the precious metals industry. A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6%, making precious metals more expensive for most buyers. Platinum tumbled more than 10%. >President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair, Bloomberg News reported. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time. >Gold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.” >With gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades. >Even after the pullback, gold is still up around 17% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up nearly 40% so far this year. >The Trump administration’s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela’s leader, along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver. Most recently, Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba. >Meanwhile, the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal. The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry *Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1...* *Processing img obfjz24gfhgg1...* *Processing img myzc6u4u5kgg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Post title says surge which is not_accurate . It should be rebounded Gold 8 % and silver 17 % was at the lowest point in premarket . Check the charts at the bottom of this post . Source Gold and silver suffered the biggest selloff in years in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that ’ s lifted prices to alltime highs . Gold dropped as much as 8 % to crash through $ 5000 an ounce while silver slumped below $ 100 as the selloff swept through the broader metals markets . Copper dropped more than 3 % in London after surging above $ 14000 a ton for the first time on Thursday in its biggest intraday jump since 2008 . The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair . The greenback ’ s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken . Chinese investors have led the charge buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets . Silver plunged more than 17 % toward $ 95 an ounce intensifying a period of extreme volatility that ’ s rocked the precious metals industry . A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6 % making precious metals more expensive for most buyers . Platinum tumbled more than 10 % . President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair Bloomberg News reported . The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates . Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time . Gold ’ s move “ validates the cautionary tale of fastup fastdown ” said Christopher Wong a strategist at OverseaChinese Banking Corp . While reports of Warsh ’ s nomination were a trigger a correction was overdue he said . “ It ’ s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves. ” With gold and silver jumping so much already this year some technical indicators flashed warning signs . One is the relativestrength index which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction . Gold ’ s RSI recently hit 90 the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades . Even after the pullback gold is still up around 17 % in January closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980 . The jump in silver has been eyewatering with the white metal up nearly 40 % so far this year . The Trump administration ’ s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela ’ s leader along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver . Most recently Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba . Meanwhile the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal . The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1 ...

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a five-month odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank. The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection. The pick of Warsh, 55, likely wouldn’t ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street’s view that he wouldn’t always do Trump’s bidding. “He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn’t going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,” added Bahnsen. Since Powell’s confirmation in 2018, during Trump’s first term, he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, the president kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed’s massive renovation of its Washington, D.C. headquarters.",
