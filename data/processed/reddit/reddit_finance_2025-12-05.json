On many levels this doesn't bode well for the company. WBD still has about $43 billion dollars in combined long-term and short-term debt on its balance sheet and still tens of billions of dollars in intangible assets.

      "selftext": "Morgan Stanley, one of the key players in financing the artificial-intelligence race, is considering offloading some of its data-center exposure via a so-called significant risk transfer. The bank has held preliminary talks with potential investors about an SRT tied to a portfolio of loans to businesses involved in AI infrastructure, according to people with knowledge of the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential. SRTs backed by data-center exposure are still a nascent slice of the credit-risk transfer market, where banks hedge their credit exposure, manage capital ratios and free up balance-sheet capacity for more lending by selling credit-linked notes to institutional investors. Morgan Stanley is also exploring other ways to hedge or syndicate part of its data-center risk, the people said, and there is no guarantee the early-stage SRT talks will result in a deal. Morgan Stanley in October arranged over $27 billion of debt and about $2.5 billion of equity financing for a special-purpose vehicle tied to the development of Meta Platforms Inc.’s Hyperion data-center site in Richland Parish, Louisiana. The bank also led three recent junk-bond offerings from TeraWulf Inc., Cipher Mining Inc., and Applied Digital Corp. in which the proceeds were earmarked in part to help finance the construction of new data-center facilities. Morgan Stanley strategists forecast big cloud computing companies will spend about $3 trillion on data-center infrastructure projects through 2028. Cash flow can fund only about half of that, the bank estimates, with most of the rest raised via debt markets. The lending surge may leave banks overexposed to a small group of companies.

      "selftext": "From doing past analysis, I realized that most people, including myself, miss out on life-changing huge gains because we sell our stocks too early. There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100-200% and some over 5Y went up 1000%-3000%. One thing I noticed people like to do is day-trade or swing-trade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days. They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly. But then afterwards, the stock that they just sold ends up going up +30% in one day suddenly, then continues to go up consistently day by day, +5%, +7%, +3%... and so on, eventually before you know it, the stock has already went up +100%. Personally, I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buy-and-hold approach. I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future. Hence, I try my absolute best not to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dips/crashes, or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential.",

There are ton of stocks that within 1Y went up 100200 % and some over 5Y went up 1000 % 3000 % . One thing I noticed people like to do is daytrade or swingtrade and they feel good making a few thousand in one trade in just a few days . They think that they just made their monthly salary in a quick amount of time effortlessly . But then afterwards the stock that they just sold ends up going up 30 % in one day suddenly then continues to go up consistently day by day 5 % 7 % 3 % ... and so on eventually before you know it the stock has already went up 100 % . Personally I have changed my strategy and adopted more of a buyandhold approach . I view each share as precious and something that could be cheap now could be very valuable in the future . Hence I try my absolute best not_to sell any share unless I want to take profit and switch the money to either a defensive cash position to wait and buy dipscrashes or switch the money to another stock that I feel has higher growth potential ."

      "title": "TAL EDUCATION $TAL – A Bet on China Policy Shift",
      "selftext": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist. I've been openly bullish on Chinese equities, not blindly on the macro, but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years. My core China positions are BABA, BILI, WB, PDD, etc., and while digging through various research notes and podcasts, TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse. **Here's my thinking:** China's economy has been hit hard, much of it self-inflicted. The real estate crisis hit consumption, valuations eventually collapsed, Western capital stepped away, and the regulatory wave in 2020-2021 crushed entire industries overnight, private education/tutoring being one of the hardest hit. TAL, a leader in the space, went from a \\~$90 stock to a \\~$1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed. But today, the macro backdrop is subtly shifting. Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy, support job creation, and encourage entrepreneurship. Real estate cleanup efforts are underway, consumer data, while not amazing, is, and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift. None of this screams \"China is fixed,\" but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction. **The Key Catalyst: Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions** One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinese-focused podcasts and panels is this: Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education. Remember: the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out China's private tutoring industry, which had been massive. TAL went from a \\~$90 stock to $1. That was the market pricing in near-death. Logic behind potential easing makes sense: * ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer * ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category * It acted as a foundational support for talent creation. Which is now a h * Households spend \\~17% of income on education (\\~5x the global average) * Investment + hiring + innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured, regulated private education aligns with national goals, especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs. Beijing seeks to nurture local talent, enhance educational outcomes, and boost household spending. Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense, as it can stimulate the economy, revive consumption, and promote upward mobility. This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules, making it a rational strategy. The Kicker: If the tutoring industry reopens, even partially, TAL and New Oriental (EDU) would effectively operate as a duopoly. Heavy compliance requirements + political scrutiny = massive barriers to new entrants. For Beijing, this is actually preferable, and for investors, even more so. **Why TAL Specifically?** This is no longer the old hyper-growth, hyper-aggressive, burn-capital tutoring giant. TAL today is: * Leaner * ﻿﻿More tech-driven * Operating within defined regulatory lanes * ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves * ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward ed-tech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly, TAL's operational muscle memory, national presence, brand trust, and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage. Think of it as a coiled spring. Regulatory easing doesn't need to revive 2019 TAL. It just needs to allow profitable, compliant business lines to scale. The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $8 and $11 for months. It's been essentially flat, under-owned, and overlooked. For me, this is what an asymmetric setup looks like: limited structural downside, but substantial upside if policy shifts in TAL's favor. A re-rating doesn't require TAL to return to its old model-it simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries. **MY POSITION:** 200 Contracts of the $10 Strike, Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $3.5 in premiums for a total of $71,712 **TL;DR** * ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdown-big potential catalyst. * Education is huge in China: households spend \\~17% of income on it (\\~5x global avg). * Reopening the sector helps job creation, consumption, and talent development. * ﻿﻿If rules loosen, TAL + EDU become a near-duopoly due to heavy compliance barriers * ﻿﻿Stock has been range-bound ($8-$11) but sentiment + policy tone in China is improving. * I'm in Jan 2027 $10 calls (200 contracts, \\~$72K) as a long-term bet.",

      "selftext_processed": "TAL Education Group has quietly crept back into my watchlist . Ive been openly bullish on Chinese equities not_blindly on the macro but on the recovery potential of a handful of tech names that have been hammered over the past few years . My core China positions are BABA BILI WB PDD etc . and while digging through various research notes and podcasts TAL started standing out again for the first time since its 2021 collapse . Heres my thinking Chinas economy has been hit hard much of it selfinflicted . The real estate crisis hit consumption valuations eventually collapsed Western capital stepped away and the regulatory wave in 20202021 crushed entire industries overnight private educationtutoring being one of the hardest hit . TAL a leader in the space went from a $ 90 stock to a $ 1 stock essentially because its business model was outlawed . But today the macro backdrop is subtly shifting . Policymakers have been signaling a growing willingness to stabilize the economy support job creation and encourage entrepreneurship . Real estate cleanup efforts are underway consumer data while not_amazing is and sentiment from global investors is beginning to shift . None of this screams China is fixed but it does suggest changes are happening to move it in the right direction . The Key Catalyst Easing of the 2021 Education Restrictions One recurring theme heard across multiple Chinesefocused podcasts and panels is this Beijing is considering easing or clarifying the 2021 crackdown on private education . Remember the 2021 regulations essentially wiped out Chinas private tutoring industry which had been massive . TAL went from a $ 90 stock to $ 1 . That was the market pricing in neardeath . Logic behind potential easing makes sense ﻿﻿Private tutoring was a major employer ﻿﻿It was a major consumer spending category It acted as a foundational support for talent creation . Which is now a h Households spend 17 % of income on education 5x the global average Investment hiring innovation in the sector previously contributed meaningfully to growth Reopening the pathway for structured regulated private education aligns with national goals especially as China aims to develop domestic entrepreneurs . Beijing seeks to nurture local talent enhance educational outcomes and boost household spending . Allowing compliant private education platforms to operate again under tighter regulations makes strategic sense as it can stimulate the economy revive consumption and promote upward mobility . This approach enables the private education industry to function again under clearer rules making it a rational strategy . The Kicker If the tutoring industry reopens even partially TAL and New Oriental EDU would effectively operate as a duopoly . Heavy compliance requirements political scrutiny massive barriers to new entrants . For Beijing this is actually preferable and for investors even more so . Why TAL Specifically This is no_longer the old hypergrowth hyperaggressive burncapital tutoring giant . TAL today is Leaner ﻿﻿More techdriven Operating within defined regulatory lanes ﻿﻿Sitting on real cash reserves ﻿﻿Quietly pivoting toward edtech and licensed services If regulations relax even modestly TALs operational muscle memory national presence brand trust and digital infrastructure give it a huge advantage . Think of it as a coiled spring . Regulatory easing doesnt need to revive 2019 TAL . It just needs to allow profitable compliant business lines to scale . The stock has been trading in a pretty tight range between $ 8 and $ 11 for months . Its been essentially flat underowned and overlooked . For me this is what an asymmetric setup looks like limited structural downside but substantial upside if policy shifts in TALs favor . A rerating doesnt require TAL to return to its old modelit simply requires Beijing to give the industry clarity and permission to grow within defined boundaries . MY POSITION 200 Contracts of the $ 10 Strike Jan 15 2027 Calls Paid an Average of $ 3.5 in premiums for a total of $ 71712 TLDR ﻿﻿China may be easing or clarifying the 2021 tutoring crackdownbig potential catalyst . Education is huge in China households spend 17 % of income on it 5x global avg . Reopening the sector helps job creation consumption and talent development . ﻿﻿If rules loosen TAL EDU become a nearduopoly due to heavy compliance barriers ﻿﻿Stock has been rangebound $ 8 $ 11 but sentiment policy tone in China is improving . Im in Jan 2027 $ 10 calls 200 contracts $ 72K as a longterm bet ."

      "title": "Japan's interest rate hike may trigger a major shock to global markets, signaling the end of the era of low interest rates!",
      "selftext": "Everyone's been focused on the Federal Reserve's actions lately, but what could truly ignite global markets this month isn't Washington, but Tokyo. This country, dormant for over 20 years, is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows. Over the past week, Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends, with the 30-year rate hitting a record high, the 10-year rate breaking a 17-year high, and even the 20-year rate reaching multi-year highs. For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates, this is no longer just market volatility, but a complete interest rate restart. More importantly, Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time, directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting. This sudden change has triggered high market tension, because last August, when Japan only slightly raised interest rates, global markets overreacted instantly, experiencing massive asset sell-offs. At that time, US stocks plummeted, Bitcoin was severely impacted, and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars. This time, it seems Japan is truly preparing to \"walk,\" and may even start \"running.\" How much impact will this have on global capital flows? For the past 30 years, the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation. However, since 2023, core CPI has been rising steadily, wage growth has exceeded 3%, and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991. This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases. But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery, if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates, the yen will continue to depreciate significantly, severely impacting Japan's import costs and corporate profits. Therefore, Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hard-won economic structure. The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the market's reaction. This strategy itself is a financial stress test; the market is no longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates, but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows. The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on low-interest-rate funds from Japan. Now, if Japan raises interest rates, this capital chain will begin to reverse, and global assets will face the risk of repricing. Why would this trigger a stampede? Because in the past, global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade, using low-interest-rate funds to invest in higher-yield assets (such as US stocks, US bonds, and Bitcoin). If the yen appreciates, these funds will have to be withdrawn, potentially triggering a massive asset sell-off. When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly, global financial market volatility will be even more severe. Last August's interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen, but it already triggered a sharp market reaction. This time, the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow, particularly from US and tech stocks, as well as high-risk assets globally. Whenever Japan raises interest rates, global investment portfolios will face reassessment, especially those high-risk assets reliant on low-cost funding. As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer, global markets are already preparing for a possible \"unwinding wave.\" Markets are becoming increasingly nervous, and investors are beginning to withdraw from high-risk assets, particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin. In the coming months, global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike, far exceeding the impact of fundamentals. Therefore, what truly needs attention now is not whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike.",

      "selftext_processed": "Everyones been focused on the Federal Reserves actions lately but what could truly ignite global markets this month isnt Washington but Tokyo . This country dormant for over 20 years is now releasing a signal that could potentially alter the trajectory of global capital flows . Over the past week Japanese government bond yields have surged dramatically from short to long ends with the 30year rate hitting a record high the 10year rate breaking a 17year high and even the 20year rate reaching multiyear highs . For a country that has long maintained stable interest rates this is no_longer just market volatility but a complete interest rate restart . More importantly Bank of Japan Governor Kazumi Nakada unusually hinted ahead of time directly stating that a significant decision might be made at the December meeting . This sudden change has triggered high market tension because last August when Japan only slightly raised interest rates global markets overreacted instantly experiencing massive asset selloffs . At that time US stocks plummeted Bitcoin was severely impacted and global market capitalization evaporated by hundreds of billions of dollars . This time it seems Japan is truly preparing to walk and may even start running . How much impact will this have on global capital flows For the past 30 years the Japanese economy has been mired in deflation . However since 2023 core CPI has been rising steadily wage growth has exceeded 3 % and wage negotiations have reached their highest level since 1991 . This means that Japan has finally achieved a positive cycle of inflation and wage increases . But just like the pressures brought by economic recovery if Japan continues to maintain low interest rates the yen will continue to depreciate significantly severely impacting Japans import costs and corporate profits . Therefore Japan must now decide to raise interest rates to avoid damaging the hardwon economic structure . The Bank of Japan has released signals in advance to test the markets reaction . This strategy itself is a financial stress test the market is no_longer concerned about whether Japan will raise interest rates but rather whether it will trigger a chain reaction of global capital flows . The rise of global risk assets over the past decade has been partly due to reliance on lowinterestrate funds from Japan . Now if Japan raises interest rates this capital chain will begin to reverse and global assets will face the risk of repricing . Why would this trigger a stampede Because in the past global funds have borrowed heavily in yen for carry trade using lowinterestrate funds to invest in higheryield assets such as US stocks US bonds and Bitcoin . If the yen appreciates these funds will have to be withdrawn potentially triggering a massive asset selloff . When these trillions of dollars begin to withdraw rapidly global financial market volatility will be even more severe . Last Augusts interest rate hike only slightly appreciated the yen but it already triggered a sharp market reaction . This time the market is worried that a Japanese interest rate hike could trigger an even larger capital outflow particularly from US and tech stocks as well as highrisk assets globally . Whenever Japan raises interest rates global investment portfolios will face reassessment especially those highrisk assets reliant on lowcost funding . As expectations of a Japanese interest rate hike become clearer global markets are already preparing for a possible unwinding wave . Markets are becoming increasingly nervous and investors are beginning to withdraw from highrisk assets particularly highly liquid assets such as tech stocks and Bitcoin . In the coming months global market volatility will likely be dominated by the funding chain disruptions caused by the Japanese interest rate hike far exceeding the impact of fundamentals . Therefore what truly needs attention now is not_whether the Federal Reserve raises interest rates but the deeper implications behind the Japanese interest rate hike ."

      "selftext": "Apple’s general counsel, Kate Adams, and its vice president for environment, policy, and social initiatives, Lisa Jackson, will retire from Apple, the company announced on Thursday. Apple said that Jennifer Newstead would become Apple’s new general counsel in March next year and that Jackson’s government affairs staff would report to her. The two executives previously reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook and represent the latest sign that Apple’s senior leadership is seeing a slew of exits. In recent weeks, Apple’s head software designer said he was leaving to go to Meta, Apple said that its AI chief was retiring, and Apple’s chief operating officer retired. Adams joined Apple and became general counsel in 2017, and oversaw legal matters including litigation, global security, and the company’s privacy initiatives. Under Adams, Apple grappled with rising antitrust scrutiny and regulation around the world, including major lawsuits in the U.S. over the iPhone App Store’s restrictions and fees. Jackson joined Apple in 2013, and led the company’s diversity programs as well as much of its policy work in Washington, D.C. Prior to joining Apple in 2013, she spent four years as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a position she was appointed to by President Barack Obama. In that role, Jackson “focused on reducing greenhouse gases, protecting air and water quality, preventing exposure to toxic contamination, and expanding outreach to communities on environmental issues,” according to her bio on Apple’s website. Jackson was instrumental in Apple’s launch of its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative following the 2020 murder of George Floyd. She then helped expand the company’s equity and justice efforts to other countries, including the U.K., Mexico and New Zealand, according to a report on the initiative in 2023. “At Apple, we pledge that our resolve will not fade,” Jackson wrote in a section of that report. “We won’t delay action. We will work, each and every day, on the urgent task of advancing equity.” Jackson also accompanied Cook to several official functions in Washington, including state dinners. Source: [",

      "selftext": "MoonLake ($MLTX) is soaring today, and I believe we are just getting started. This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now, and a run-up to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th. Thesis (TL;DR): MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90%—because the market hyper-focused on a single narrowly missed endpoint, not the whole data set. Under the surface, sonelokimab (SLK) hit consistent, significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases, with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks. This is one of those rare moments where “disaster” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity. Data & Why the Panic Is Overdone: • VELA-1: Big win. Mid-30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo, all core secondaries positive. • VELA-2: Drug effect consistent with VELA-1, but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread (p ≈ .05). All secondary endpoints still positive; combined analysis is strongly significant (p < 0.001). []( [SLK HS VELA Trial Data]( • Takeaway: High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials. Look at the totality: consistent drug effect, positive secondaries, and durable benefit, not “dead drug.” More Than HS: Platform Upside (4 Indications):SLK is not a one-trick pony. MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications, including: • Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS): Adult and adolescent, with long-term extension data. • Palmoplantar Pustulosis (PPP): LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive, immediate pipeline upgrade. • Axial Spondyloarthritis (axSpA): S-OLARIS readout Q1 2026. • Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA): IZAR Phase 3, 2026. Upcoming Catalysts (Why Act Now): • Dec 15, 2025: FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application. A “yes” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher, while a “not without additional data” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90% one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year. • Q4 2025: LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform, not just HS. • Q1–Q2 2026: S-OLARIS (axSpA), VELA-TEEN/long-term HS, IZAR (PsA). You basically have a week or two to get a thesis-confirming or thesis-breaking regulatory answer—at panic-level valuations. Balance Sheet: MoonLake isn’t hurting for cash. They have hundreds of millions on hand, a fresh $75M raise, with extended runway into 2027. You’re not waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst; you’re waiting for data, and more data is coming imminently. Lawsuit/FUD Section (for the Record):Yes, the numerous class actions headlines exist: they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed, if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response. In biotech, legal and headline risk is always present post-drop, but those lawsuits don’t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon. The lawsuits are noise; the SLK’s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal. Risks: • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn. • LEDA readout/other pipeline indications could go nowhere and this is still a one-asset, high-volatility biotech—but I like the data so far. Asymmetric Setup: Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what’s not priced in is a credible FDA greenlight, positive PPP data, and the multi-indication platform angle. The next two catalysts (FDA and LEDA) will likely decide if this rerates violently higher, in the very near term. This window, with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits, could close fast. Part of the reason I'm so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock, which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline \"miss\". The data is there - SLK works, the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesn't work. But the data says it does, and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not just HS, but also PPP, PsA, axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesn't work. I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher, and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one. [I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—I'm posting this one.]( Disclosure: I (obviously) own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options, my kids even own MLTX. **I like the stock.** I don't know your personal financial situation, this is not financial advice.

      "selftext_processed": "MoonLake $ MLTX is soaring today and I believe we are just getting started . This is the beginning of a move from additional data that can drop any day now and a runup to an FDA meeting on Dec 15th . Thesis TLDR MoonLake fell off a cliff after its big HS Phase 3 readout—down nearly 90 % —because the market hyperfocused on a single narrowly missed endpoint not_the whole data set . Under the surface sonelokimab SLK hit consistent significant efficacy and is being evaluated for multiple diseases with two pivotal catalysts coming within weeks . This is one of those rare moments where “ disaster ” headlines might be the exact signal for opportunity . Data Why the Panic Is Overdone • VELA1 Big win . Mid30s HiSCR response vs teens placebo all core secondaries positive . • VELA2 Drug effect consistent with VELA1 but placebo rate jumped—primary missed by a thread p ≈ .05 . All secondary endpoints still positive combined analysis is strongly significant p 0.001 . SLK HS VELA Trial Data • Takeaway High placebo noise like this is standard in HS trials . Look at the totality consistent drug effect positive secondaries and durable benefit not_ “ dead drug. ” More Than HS Platform Upside 4 IndicationsSLK is not_a onetrick pony . MoonLake is moving fast across multiple indications including • Hidradenitis Suppurativa HS Adult and adolescent with longterm extension data . • Palmoplantar Pustulosis PPP LEDA Phase 2 expected very soon—if positive immediate pipeline upgrade . • Axial Spondyloarthritis axSpA SOLARIS readout Q1 2026 . • Psoriatic Arthritis PsA IZAR Phase 3 2026 . Upcoming Catalysts Why Act Now • Dec 15 2025 FDA Type B meeting to discuss whether the current HS data package is sufficient to support a Biologics License Application . A “ yes ” could drive a meaningful stock rerating higher while a “ not without additional data ” outcome appears largely already reflected in the prior 90 % one‑day decline but would buy additional time setting MLTX up for potential rerating as we get additional data readouts on the various trials and indications within the next year . • Q4 2025 LEDA PPP readout—further potential to validate the SLK platform not_just HS . • Q1–Q2 2026 SOLARIS axSpA VELATEENlongterm HS IZAR PsA . You basically have a week or two to get a thesisconfirming or thesisbreaking regulatory answer—at paniclevel valuations . Balance Sheet MoonLake isn ’ t hurting for cash . They have hundreds of millions on hand a fresh $ 75M raise with extended runway into 2027 . You ’ re not_waiting for a raise headline after every catalyst you ’ re waiting for data and more data is coming imminently . LawsuitFUD Section for the RecordYes the numerous class actions headlines exist they claim management pumped SLK effectiveness beyond what the data readouts allegedly showed if you only focus one a single narrowly missed data point ultimately caused by higher placebo response . In biotech legal and headline risk is always present postdrop but those lawsuits don ’ t change the underlying drug effect or what the FDA—and larger future pharma buyers—will review soon . The lawsuits are noise the SLK ’ s efficacy and a path forward to FDA approval is the signal . Risks • FDA could require more data or reject the BLA proposal—delays and more cash burn . • LEDA readoutother pipeline indications could go nowhere_and this is still a oneasset highvolatility biotech—but I like the data so far . Asymmetric Setup Almost all the bad is priced in after the crash—what ’ s not_priced in is a credible FDA greenlight positive PPP data and the multiindication platform angle . The next two catalysts FDA and LEDA will likely decide if this rerates violently higher in the very near term . This window with two catalysts stacked right in front of the tape and the whole Street trading off panic and lawsuits could close fast . Part of the reason Im so bullish here is MLTX is a small overlooked stock which has pretty much been left for dead here after the Phase 3 VELA Primary Endpoint headline miss . The data is there SLK works the market has priced MLTX like SLK doesnt work . But the data says it does and there are additional trials to show that SLK works across not_just HS but also PPP PsA axSpA but the market is still pricing MLTX like SLK doesnt work . I believe that means the market needs to reprice higher and rapidly with the barrage of catalysts ahead on this one . I have other holdings than this but just to satisfy requirements—Im posting this one . Disclosure I obviously own MLTX stock and MLTX stock options my kids even own MLTX . I like the stock . I dont know your personal financial situation this is not_financial advice . Do your own research ."

I realize they have an absolutely massive geyser of cash from their advertising but why did sinking tens of billions into the metaverse several years ago never seem to depress their income?

Did the advertising business just so happened to grow at a rate that canceled all that spending out?",

      "title": "[DD] WIX: The Market Says \"Dead Legacy Tech.\" The Math Says \"Rule of 40\" Cash Cow (9x EV/FCF).",
      "selftext": "I've been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive, and I kept ignoring **Wix (WIX)**. Like most of you, I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify. But I finally dug into their 10-Ks and updated guidance for 2025, and honestly, the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment. It looks like a classic capital return play that's being priced like a distressed asset. I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if I'm missing something obvious. Here is the raw math I’m looking at: 1. They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise. I thought they were unprofitable. Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and it's showing up in the GAAP numbers. Check out the Free Cash Flow (FCF) margin ramp: * **2022:** 2% (Barely broke even at $32M) * **2023:** 16% ($246M) * **2024:** 28% ($488M) * **2025 (Est):** 30%+ (On track for \\~$600M) Basically, they hit the \"Rule of 40\" way faster than anyone expected, but the stock price hasn't really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow. 2. The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30% margins, they usually trade at a premium. WIX is in the basement. * **WIX is trading at \\~9.0x EV/FCF.** * **The median for their peer group is around 14.2x.** * **The \"Quality\" names trade at 15-25x.** Even if you don't think WIX is a \"premium\" asset, a 40% discount to the *median* seems excessive for a company printing $600M a year in cash. 3. The \"AI Risk\" might be backwards The bear case is always \"AI will make website builders obsolete.\" I looked into this, and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now. Two things stood out in the segments: 1. **Partners (Agencies):** This isn't DIY revenue. This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients. It grew at a **30% CAGR** and hit **$610M** in 2024. This revenue is way stickier than the churn-heavy DIY stuff. 2. **Base44:** They bought/launched this AI app builder recently. It went from **300k users in June '25 to 2 Million in October**. I haven't modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe, but it gives them a foot in the door of the $25B low-code market. Valuation / Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins (low 30s) and keep growing revenue at a boring 15%. My model spits out an intrinsic value of around **$170**. Even if I'm wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow, the stock should be significantly higher than $96. **Where could I be wrong? (Bear Case)** I'm trying to kill this trade before I size up. * Obviously, Shopify is the elephant in the room. WIX seems to be winning on \"services\" websites vs. pure e-commerce, but the overlap is scary. * Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026? If the macro turns, their churn could look ugly fast. Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently? Am I overestimating the stickiness there? **Disclosure:** Long WIX. **Reference:** I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been screening for value in SaaS lately because everything feels expensive and I kept ignoring Wix WIX . Like most of you I still thought of them as that annoying legacy website builder from 2015 that loses money and gets crushed by Shopify . But I finally dug into their 10Ks and updated guidance for 2025 and honestly the numbers tell a completely different story than the sentiment . It looks like a classic capital return play thats being priced like a distressed asset . I wanted to throw my thesis out here to see if Im missing something obvious . Here is the raw math I ’ m looking at 1 . They actually stopped burning cash This was my biggest surprise . I thought they were unprofitable . Turns out management did a hard pivot on efficiency over the last 18 months and its showing up in the GAAP numbers . Check out the Free Cash Flow FCF margin ramp 2022 2 % Barely broke even at $ 32M 2023 16 % $ 246M 2024 28 % $ 488M 2025 Est 30 % On track for $ 600M Basically they hit the Rule of 40 way faster than anyone expected but the stock price hasnt really moved to reflect that they are now a cash cow . 2 . The Multiple is weirdly low If you look at other SaaS companies growing revenue in the double digits with 30 % margins they usually trade at a premium . WIX is in the basement . WIX is trading at 9.0x EVFCF . The median for their peer group is around 14.2x . The Quality names trade at 1525x . Even if you dont think WIX is a premium asset a 40 % discount to the median seems excessive for a company printing $ 600M a year in cash . 3 . The AI Risk might be backwards The bear case is always AI will make website builders obsolete . I looked into this and it seems like AI is actually acting as a funnel for them right now . Two things stood out in the segments 1 . Partners Agencies This isnt DIY revenue . This is B2B revenue from agencies building sites for clients . It grew at a 30 % CAGR and hit $ 610M in 2024 . This revenue is way stickier than the churnheavy DIY stuff . 2 . Base44 They boughtlaunched this AI app builder recently . It went from 300k users in June 25 to 2 Million in October . I havent modeled much revenue from this yet to be safe but it gives them a foot in the door of the $ 25B lowcode market . Valuation Summary I ran a DCF assuming they just hold the line on margins low 30s and keep growing revenue at a boring 15 % . My model spits out an intrinsic value of around $ 170 . Even if Im wrong on the growth and just apply a standard 14x multiple to their current cash flow the stock should be significantly higher than $ 96 . Where could I be wrong Bear Case Im trying to kill this trade before I size up . Obviously Shopify is the elephant in the room . WIX seems to be winning on services websites vs. pure ecommerce but the overlap is scary . Are SMBs about to get crushed in 2026 If the macro turns their churn could look ugly fast . Has anyone else looked at their Partner numbers recently Am I overestimating the stickiness there Disclosure Long WIX . Reference I put all my charts and other details into a PDF if you want to check my math on my blog"

      "selftext": "Been investing for a while now. Stocks, real estate, some Solana through Asgard, the usual mix. My rule: 70% return, I take half off minimum. Sometimes all of it. Why? Because I've watched too many people ride winners back to zero waiting for \"just a bit more.\" The greed is real and it kills portfolios. That said - I break this rule for stuff I'm actually long on. Real estate that's throwing off cash? Not selling. Solana I'm staking? Staying put. Quality dividend plays? Those compound forever. But random defi yields, momentum stocks, anything that smells like hype? 70% and gone. No second thoughts. Basically: exit the bets, hold the investments. you all have a number like this???",

      "selftext": "Amazon is considering terminating its long-term contract with the United States Postal Service (USPS) to instead establish its own nationwide competitive delivery network. The existing agreement between the e-commerce giant and the USPS expires in October 2026. The two parties have spent months negotiating the next version of the contract, but talks have become complicated due to President Trump's push to privatize the USPS. Under the current deal, Amazon pays the USPS billions of dollars annually to distribute packages, accounting for roughly 7.5% of the agency's projected 2025 revenue. This agreement plays a crucial role in the USPS's financial model. However, Amazon already operates an extensive transportation network, including aircraft, Rivian electric vans, and an emerging drone delivery service though the drone project has faced multiple challenges this year, including a recent investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration. It is also developing autonomous vehicles through its subsidiary Zoox, further strengthening its control over last mile delivery. Should Amazon decide to terminate its partnership with the USPS, it could have significant implications for the logistics industry. As Amazon bolsters its logistics network, will companies like Rivian and Zoox see further growth opportunities?",

      "selftext": "The Federal Reserve's growing pressure for further rate cuts is gradually brightening the outlook for emerging market assets next year. Fidelity International stated: “If 2025 is a strong year for emerging markets, just wait for 2026.” This asset manager, overseeing over $1 trillion in assets, is joining a growing number of Wall Street banks betting that a weaker dollar will drive returns in developing-market assets next year. Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last year's rate hikes. While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year, substantial capital remains unallocated. This may lay the groundwork for 2026, where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations. Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets? After all, these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential. But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets' 2025 performance. Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 (according to MSCI indices). We know the dollar and euro often move inversely, and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness. In contrast, Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound. Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality, with many believing greater market opportunities exist here.",

Fidelity International stated “ If 2025 is a strong year for emerging markets just wait for 2026. ” This asset manager overseeing over $ 1 trillion in assets is joining a growing number of Wall Street banks betting that a weaker dollar will drive returns in developingmarket assets next year . Yet governments appear reassured that currencies have nearly erased last years rate hikes . While electromagnetic trade has been discussed throughout the year substantial capital remains unallocated . This may lay the groundwork for 2026 where we could see a significant increase in emerging market debt allocations . Could this subtly enhance the appeal of developing market assets After all these economies offer higher interest rates and currencies with appreciation potential . But asset managers face a high bar to outperform emerging markets 2025 performance . Emerging currencies and equities are poised for their best year since 2017 according to MSCI indices . We know the dollar and euro often move inversely and a structural shift in the soft dollar is emerging prompting firms like Morgan Stanley Bank of America and Goldman Sachs to prepare for further dollar weakness . In contrast Citigroup advised emerging market investors this week to seek trades hedging against a potential dollar rebound . Many major emerging currencies are priced for crisis rather than current reality with many believing greater market opportunities exist here ."

The restructuring would likely include layoffs as Meta continues shifting resources away from its earlier metaverse ambitions and into AI, efficiency, and core products. The pivot isn’t surprising. Meta rebranded back in 2021 to bet big on the metaverse, but investor enthusiasm cooled fast as the unit racked up heavy losses. With AI now dominating Big Tech strategy (and Meta’s own AI efforts gaining traction), it looks like the company is tightening spending where returns have been the weakest. If these cuts go through, it would mark one of the clearest signs yet that Meta is prioritizing near-term profitability and AI capability over its longer-term virtual world vision. Anyone else think this is Meta admitting the metaverse bet just isn’t paying off or is this just a natural rebalancing of resources? Source: [",

The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities. >The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound ⁠in Hawaii last month, Bloomberg reported. >Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January, according to the report. Meta did not immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment. >\"Smart move, just late,\" said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber. \"This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought ​years ago.\" >The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality ‌headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. >Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community. >However, it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses, as competitors such as Alphabet's Google, [Apple]( and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts. >The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. >To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year. Overall, large tech companies are expected to spend around $400 billion on AI this year. >The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with million-dollar pay packages.",

      "selftext_processed": "Np paywall Meta is expected to make budget cuts of up to 30 % for its metaverse initiative Bloomberg News reported on Thursday citing people ​familiar with the discussions . The Facebook parents shares rose 4 % as the move eased ‌some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars only for the ‌business to burn more than $ 60 billion since 2020 . The company even changed its name to Meta from Facebook in 2021 to signal its priorities . The proposed metaverse cuts are part of the companys annual budget planning for 2026 which included a series of meetings at Zuckerbergs compound ⁠in Hawaii last month Bloomberg reported . Cuts ‌that high would most likely include layoffs as early as January according to the report . Meta did not_immediately respond to a Reuters ‍request for comment . Smart move just late said Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber . This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not_as prosperous as management thought ​years ago . The metaverse group sits within Reality Labs which produces the companys Quest mixedreality ‌headsets smart glasses made with EssilorLuxotticas RayBan and upcoming augmentedreality glasses . Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community . However it has achieved an early lead with its smart glasses as competitors such as Alphabets Google Apple and Snap failed to ⁠capitalize on the market potential with their initial attempts . The ​report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant ​in Silicon Valleys artificialintelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception . To fuel its ambitious goals Meta has committed as much as $ 72 ‍billion in capital spending ⁠this year . Overall large tech companies are expected to spend around $ 400 billion on AI this year . The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year ⁠with Zuckerberg personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp ‌with milliondollar pay packages ."

      "selftext": "Alcoa's (AA) stock price has recently shown a strong rally, climbing over 18% in the 90 days leading up to early November 2025. This positive momentum includes a jump of over 6% on December 3, 2025, reaching $44.09. This upward trend follows strong third-quarter 2025 earnings and new strategic contracts. Notably, the company has secured a 10-year renewable energy contract for its Massena smelter in New York. Their recent success is a growing demand for aluminum driven by emerging technologies, particularly data centers and batteries. The AI build-out is a major new demand driver for aluminum. Data centers require massive amounts of aluminum for components like server racks, cooling units, and radiators, as demand for the metal soars. In the battery sector, the global aluminum-based battery market is projected to grow significantly, driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market, as the market is forecast to grow from $5 billion to over $12 billion by 2032. ...and one of the best things I've heard from the Investor's Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its non-used sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations. .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turn-around story for them?",

In the battery sector the global aluminumbased battery market is projected to grow significantly driven by increasing demand for energy storage and the expansion of the EV market as the market is forecast to grow from $ 5 billion to over $ 12 billion by 2032 . ... and one of the best things Ive heard from the Investors Conference yesterday was Alcoa is considering selling some of its nonused sites to AI companies and data center operators to capitalize on the massive power infrastructure they already have in place at these locations . .Has anyone here ALSO been interested in this potential turnaround story for them"

I've been doing this for the last 9 years now and considering it's costing an average of $30k to purchase the house with deposits etc etc this is a return of roughly 8% give or take . Let's say prices rise 2-3% per year it's a 10-11% return . For the simplicity of it all is this why people just get an average of 10% in the stock market each year ? It seems like a crazy amount of work on my property end to make what people are in the S&P500 . I know the stock market goes up and down and end up averaging out but if I'm looking at the next 20years . What's everyone's thoughts on steering more toward the stocks market purely because it doubles every 9years or so on average I know . House prices I don't see doubling every 9-10year . Am I missing something here ? I'll add in that I've had a very successful run with property just wondering if it's time to park the $ in stocks rather than more roofs",

Is it because of the threat of all those new AI software Midjourney Stable Diffusion etc I cant reach how well these 2 companies performed .

      "selftext": "I’ve always felt Tesla is one of the strangest stocks I follow. Every few weeks the headlines turn super bearish or sentiment feels awful, and somehow the price just refuses to die. Since October it’s actually held up better than I expected: it was around $456 back then, dropped into the high $380s in November, bounced back to ~430, and now it’s sitting in the mid-440s. After all that noise, it’s basically only a small step down from October. What’s weird to me is that the news in the same period hasn’t sounded great. I remember a bunch of pieces about “margins getting crushed” and “Tesla losing its EV lead” as cheaper EVs (especially from China) grabbed share. In places like France and Sweden, sales were down something like 40–50% YoY, and I just saw another article saying that in the UK, November sales were down about 19%, yet TSLA still roughly up 4%. After Q3, the stock did sell off for a bit, which kind of matched the mood: GAAP operating income down ~40% YoY, operating margin ~5.8%, total gross margin ~18%, auto gross margin ex-credits only mid-teens vs close to 30% at the peak. Revenue hit a record, but net income was still down ~35–40% YoY. The one real bright spot was they printed almost $4B in free cash flow and have over $40B in cash, so the balance sheet doesn’t really scare me. Personally I still see Tesla as a genuinely “very good” auto + energy business, I just can’t really call it cheap here with a big margin of safety. For me to get more comfortable, I’d want either a clear trend of margin recovery, or the AI / FSD / robotics story actually showing up as a visible line on the P&L instead of just keynotes and hype. So I’m honestly curious: if Tesla mostly stays a really good auto + energy company for the rest of this decade and robotaxis / robots aren’t huge before 2030, what kind of PE would you put on that? Under that assumption, is today’s price cheap, fair, or just straight-up expensive to you? And if I butchered any of these stats, feel free to correct me in the comments. aslo anyone wants to dig into the UK stuff, this was the dashboard I was looking at: [Tesla UK sales down ~19% in November, New Automotive data shows.](",

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I received a letter from my bank yesterday. BCP Investment Group wants to buy back 20% of their shares. In the best case, I would make around an 11% profit if I sold during the buyback. However, I currently receive about a 10% dividend per year after taxes (based on the tax rules in my country). At the moment, I would not sell. I have held the stock for 12 months already, which means I have already gotten back 10% of my purchase price through dividends. I also believe that asset-backed lending, specialty financing, and hybrid capital are financial instruments that will be used even more in the future. What is your opinion on BCP?",

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then it's really hard to know if they actually own what they're talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow, just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably won't work out. I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe I'm not figuring out how to use it right? Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept it's not designed for serious analysis, what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment",

The verified accounts seem maybe slightly better but even then its really hard to know if they actually own what theyre talking about After hours is when it gets even worse somehow just becomes this total echo chamber of people hyping each other up on plays that probably wont work out . I tried filtering for specific tickers but the signal to noise ratio is terrible Maybe Im not_figuring out how to use it right Like is there some way to find actually good contributors and filter out the noise or should I just accept its not_designed for serious analysis what do you all actually use for stock ideas and market sentiment"

So, including my conservative margin of safety, this means the stock has about a 66% upside. The only worrying and troubling thing is Charter Communications has billions and billions og dollars of debt on its current balance. I understand that this particular industry is very capital intensive, but this ​it still gives me pause. There is also the risk that in the medium term, Charter could lose customers to other companies in the industry. However, I'm still going to undertake a deep dive and do a full due diligence on the company and its stock. And, I must admit that when I crunch the numbers, I'm going to be very conservative in my estimates. 😊😊😊😊",

For me my best investment was probably Costco . I bought in March during that random dip and just held . Boring but solid . Biggest regret Selling too early on AMD . I took profits in May thinking it ran too far too fast . Now I just stare at the chart sometimes and sigh . I ’ m starting to sketch out ideas for 2026 . Thinking about leaning a bit more into dividend stocks and maybe some international ETFs but not_sure yet . So curious to hear from other people . What was your best investment in 2025 What ’ s one you wish you had played differently And what ’ s your plan for 2026"

The guidance for next quarter was better than expected, which usually helps sentiment, but the market still seems unsure how to price the slowdown in some parts of the business. The interesting part is the AI side: Agentforce brought in over $500M in Q3 revenue, which shows that their AI-focused products are gaining real traction instead of just being a narrative play. Overall feels like a “good but not great” quarter strong AI growth, steady guidance, but not enough momentum in the broader business to push the stock higher immediately.Curious how others are viewing this: slow and steady transition into an AI-driven CRM model, or signs of a plateau?

The guidance for next quarter was better than expected which usually helps sentiment but the market still seems unsure how to price the slowdown in some parts of the business . The interesting part is the AI side Agentforce brought in over $ 500M in Q3 revenue which shows that their AIfocused products are gaining real traction instead of just being a narrative play . Overall feels like a “ good but not_great ” quarter strong AI growth steady guidance but not_enough momentum in the broader business to push the stock higher immediately.Curious how others are viewing this slow and steady transition into an AIdriven CRM model or signs of a plateau Source"

I think it would be very bullish if their offer for WarnerBros went through, but apparently Trump plans to launch an \"investigation\" into Netflix since he's buddy buddy with the Ellison's. That aside, the valuation has come down to \\~32x forward earnings. Considering their moat, earnings growth, margins, returns on capital, I don't think it's unreasonable. I'm also bullish on the Netflix House concept, especially if they can get the IP from WarnerBros (GoT, DC, TLOU, etc.). Also, would love to hear thoughts on the potential acquisition itself. It's hard to get a feel for it, some things point to Netflix and others point to Paramount. Markets on PM and Kalshi aren't liquid enough to give much insight, but based on those, Paramount is a slight favorite.",

I think it would be very bullish if their offer for WarnerBros went through but apparently Trump plans to launch an investigation into Netflix since hes buddy buddy with the Ellisons . That aside the valuation has come down to 32x forward earnings . Considering their moat earnings growth margins returns on capital I dont think its unreasonable . Im also bullish on the Netflix House concept especially if they can get the IP from WarnerBros GoT DC TLOU etc .. Also would love to hear thoughts on the potential acquisition itself . Its hard to get a feel for it some things point to Netflix and others point to Paramount . Markets on PM and Kalshi arent liquid enough to give much insight but based on those Paramount is a slight favorite ."

      "selftext": "Crowdstrike Holdings Inc. ($CRWD) reported a classic beat and raise quarter last night, however the stock still sold off about 3% in after hours trading. Then this morning the stock opened even lower, falling to about $486. That ended up being the low of the day before it ripped almost 7% off the bottom and closed up around 1.5%. Q3 Fiscal Year 2026 highlights, things that stood out to me: \\- Revenue grew 22% YoY to $1.23 billion, beating the $1.22 billion estimate \\- Adjusted EPS hit 96 cents, beating the 94 cent estimate \\- Added $265m of net new ARR in the quarter (+73% YoY) \\- ARR as of October 31st, 2025 was $4.92b (+23% YoY) \\- $398m in operating cash flow vs $326m last year \\- $296m in free cash flow vs $231m last year \\- Management raised guidance above expectations for the current quarter and for full year fiscal 2026 This combination led to record highs in EPS, operating cash flow, free cash flow, and net new ARR. CEO George Kurtz said this was one of the best quarters in company history and I tend to agree with him. This stock always seems to fall after reporting earnings, and then grinds higher over the next couple of months as people recognize that the quarter was actually good and don't know why they sold. Buying these kinds of dips has worked out pretty well historically, and this time doesn't look any different to me. The fundamentals here are strong, this quarter lines up the next leg of growth, and I think CrowdStrike is the strongest cybersecurity name in the market. So at these levels, do you guys view $CRWD as a buy, hold, or sell? (I do personally own the stock).",

Like last month, I knew the jobs report was gonna beat expectations by a mile. nailed the call. made literally nothing because there's no clean way to bet on that without buying calls on some tech stock and praying it moves the right way. feels like all this analysis is pointless if i can't actually trade the thesis. maybe i should just give up and buy spy calls like a normal person.",

Like last month I knew the jobs report was gon na beat expectations by a mile . nailed the call . made literally nothing_because theres no_clean way to bet on that without buying calls on some tech stock and praying it moves the right way . feels like all this analysis is pointless if i cant actually trade the thesis . maybe i should just give up and buy spy calls like a normal person ."

      "selftext": "What are your thoughts on ADBE before they report earnings on Dec 10? The company is down 37% over the last year and 25.9% YTD. They are currently trading at a PE of 20 (5 year average is 41), while the S&P is trading at a PE ratio of 30. The company is growing revenue by about 10% year over year vs the S&P at 5%. They also have very little debt, coming in at 4% vs the average of the S&P at 25%. They beat on earnings per share and revenue last quarter. They grew free cash flow by 52% over the last 12 months and are using that money to buy back shares (25 billion through 2028 to be exact). Adobe’s profit margins are steady at 29% over the last 5 years and revenue growth has been 10% per year since 2022. They are undervalued by just about every metric you look at, and yet the price continues to fall. Am I missing something here? I get the fears of AI taking over their market share and that their user base doesn’t like them, but the numbers don’t reflect that. I also hear that as much as the user base does not like their pricing, they have no other alternative but to use their products. Is anyone else buying this stock at these levels? If not, what price are you looking to start a position? Or why are you not starting a position?",

      "title": "The Notorious “AI Bubble”, Why It is Likely Not What Many Think, Yet Can Still Be A Slippery Slope",
      "selftext": "Everyone is talking about the fabled “AI Bubble” but I see a much different problem all together. Here’s what I see in phases. Just my DD. Phase 1: AI demand will keep exploding for years, like a river that keeps widening no matter how many dams you build. Look at the Micron news recently, or the Genesis Executive Order. The ruling class and the stock market will surf the early AI wave, even if the economy is doing crap (it is). Phase 2: Job cuts are more apparent as college grads already can’t get entry level jobs. Right now, AI layoffs feel like cutting “cost fat,” but if they keep going, you’re actually sawing into the bone that keeps the body alive. Who is going to buy shit from Amazon when they are broke? Who will buy a house when they can’t establish credit or a down payment? You see how this trickles? Phase 3: Structural unemployment doesn’t bounce back… AI is on track to genuinely replace occupations in many industries. I’m talking entry level positions in finance, HR, hospitality, etc, etc. Once AI can reliably handle tasks like entry-level coding, customer support, basic analysis, HR screening, or content production, companies redesign workflows around machines instead of humans, so those roles don’t come back in the same numbers or at the same pay. Over time, this creates a gap: a huge pool of workers trained for jobs that no longer exist, while new AI-era jobs (prompt engineers, system architects, AI ops, etc.) require skills, credentials, or geography that many of them don’t have. What bailout can the Fed provide if we happen to have thousands of graduates in debt that also don’t have a career option in their major? *This is kind of a doomer post, so I want to reiterate I may be and hopefully am wrong. I hope this country can thrive, but I think this AI revolution upon us will have some sour aftertastes coming.",

      "selftext": "CME FedWatch s latest data shows: The probability of a 25 basis point rate cut in December has risen to 89%. The probability of maintaining rates unchanged is approximately 11%. By January next year, the cumulative probability of a 25 basis point rate cut stands at about 65%, while the probability of a 50 basis-point cut is approximately 28%. As an investor engaged in both long term investments and short term trading, this shift is hard to ignore. My key considerations: If rate cuts materialize: Could drive gains in tech, high growth, and high beta sectors, potentially fueling speculative sentiment On the flip side: Defensive stocks and dividend assets may lose appeal in a rate-cut environment, though rate-sensitive bond trading opportunities warrant attention Caution: If markets overprice “easing” expectations, a reversal in sentiment could trigger sharp corrections I d like to hear your honest perspectives: With rising probability of rate cuts, would you preemptively position in growth stocks/tech sectors, or maintain defensive holdings/cash reserves? If trading options or high volatility assets, how would you manage potential market turbulence? Is this a trend driven opportunity or a short-term sentiment-fueled rally? Share your insights or strategies this is an opportunity to reassess positions, not blindly chase highs.",

      "selftext": "Thesis: High-quality business with durable competitive advantages trading at a reasonable price, now with improving capital allocation. Moat: Search dominance (90% share) and network effects. AI Infrastructure: Proprietary TPUs provide a cost/performance advantage over peers relying solely on Nvidia. Capital Return: Shift from cash hoarding to shareholder returns (buybacks + dividends). Valuation check: Trades at 27.1x P/E, which is a 27% discount to the peer group average of 37x. Durable advantage + reasonable price. Business Segments: Search: $56.6B revenue (Q3 '24), 14.5% YoY growth. 90% global market share remains stable despite AI threats. YouTube: $50B+ revenue (ads + subs). 2.53B reach. Dominant in streaming watch time. Cloud (GCP): $15.2B revenue (Q3 '25), 30% YoY growth, 24% operating margins. 90% of AI unicorns use GCP. Financial Health: Cash: $66.7B TTM Free Cash Flow (3.2% yield). Balance Sheet: Fortress balance sheet with $76.9B net cash and minimal debt (0.11 D/E ratio). Management (Sundar Pichai): Proven track record (Chrome, Android integration, GCP growth from 6% to 13% share). Successfully navigated AI pivot with Gemini deployment to 1B+ users. Multiples: Current P/E: 27.1x. • FCF Yield: \\~3.2%. Total Yield: \\~2.3% (2% buyback yield + 0.3% dividend yield). Capital Allocation: retiring 2-3% of shares annually; initiated first-ever dividend ($0.20/quarter). Low payout ratio (8.29%) leaves room for growth. Market Positioning: Not cheap, but valuation is attractive relative to the S&P 500 and tech peers. TPU Advantage: Vertically integrated chip stack allows for lower cost of compute for AI, protecting margins better than competitors renting Nvidia GPUs. Expert Views: Jensen Huang (Nvidia CEO): Acknowledged the quality of Google's TPU program. Internal Sentiment: CEO Pichai maintains top 5% approval ratings among peer CEOs. Competitive Check: Gemini 3 Pro and Veo 3 killing it on benchmarks. Here's my workflow visualized: [ BUY / BULLISH Conclusion: Alphabet offers a rare combination of growth (Cloud/AI) and value (Search cash cow). The transition to custom silicon (TPUs) creates a defensible long-term infrastructure advantage, while the new capital return program sets a floor for investor returns. Risks regarding AI disruption in search are mitigated by their own AI integration and hardware advantages.",

      "selftext": "No paywall. “The memory shortage has now graduated from a component-level concern to a macroeconomic risk,\" said Sanchit Vir Gogia, CEO of Greyhound Research. Memory shortage could delay AI projects, productivity gains. SK Hynix predicts memory shortage to last through late 2027. Smartphone makers warn of price rises due to soaring memory costs. An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumer-electronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies, as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data. The squeeze spans almost every type of memory, from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced high-bandwidth memory (HBM) that feeds AI chips in data centers. Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February, according to market-research firm TrendForce, drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run. The fallout could reach beyond tech. Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AI-based productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure. It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate US tariffs. Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Meta in October asked Micron for open-ended orders, telling the company they will take as much as it can deliver, irrespective of price, according to two people briefed on the talks. ::",

Memory shortage could delay AI projects productivity gains . SK Hynix predicts memory shortage to last through late 2027 . Smartphone makers warn of price rises due to soaring memory costs . An acute global shortage of memory chips is forcing artificial intelligence and consumerelectronics companies to fight for dwindling supplies as prices soar for the unglamorous but essential components that allow devices to store data . The squeeze spans almost every type of memory from flash chips used in USB drives and smartphones to advanced highbandwidth memory HBM that feeds AI chips in data centers . Prices in some segments have more than doubled since February according to marketresearch firm TrendForce drawing in traders betting that the rally has further to run . The fallout could reach beyond tech . Many economists and executives warn the protracted shortage risks slowing AIbased productivity gains and delaying hundreds of billions of dollars in digital infrastructure . It could also add inflationary pressure just as many economies are trying to tame price rises and navigate US tariffs . Google Amazon Microsoft and Meta in October asked Micron for openended orders telling the company they will take as much as it can deliver irrespective of price according to two people briefed on the talks ."

Then I started looking at what other people actually hold on blossom and man that was humbling as hell, like I'm sitting here proud of my 40% voo 30% individual stocks 30% cash thinking I'm being smart and diversified, meanwhile everyone else my age is way more aggressive and honestly crushing it because of it. For instance I saw one dude's portfolio that's like 80% growth stocks and he's up 45% this year while I'm at maybe 18%, which made me realize I'm probably being too conservative for someone with 35 years till retirement, but the weirdest part was seeing how many people just hold 3-5 positions total and do better than my diversified 25 stock portfolio, kinda makes you question if diversification is actually helping or just watering down returns tbh. Not saying I'm gonna copy what other people do but it def made me rethink my whole approach, like maybe I should take more risk while I'm young instead of investing like I'm already 50, idk… anyone else compares their portfolio to others and realizes you're way more conservative than you thought? Kinda a weird feeling…",

Intrinsic value of time and trials is not priced in. edit: this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards. Reverse reddit. Calls. As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started. Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1, 2, and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients. So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market. The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not going further down. So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point. Low risk of losing any significant amounts. The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies. before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma; the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit. lower side seems to be non-existent while the up side seems to be 10x. What am i missing here? Postion: 30k shares at 27.5 Average.",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Moderna bottomed out where it was when it started in 2019 on their cancer immunotherapy . Intrinsic value of time and trials is not_priced in . edit this sub being against it for vibes instead of science and money is all the proof i need that the stock is down and undervalued due to regards . Reverse reddit . Calls . As we all know Moderna came into being as a cancer immunotherapy company then used their tech to create the covid vax and made a ton of money on it so their stock skyrocketed and now its where it started . Since then the trials for their immunotherapy cleared phase 1 2 and is now a year into phase 3 and its massively successful in clearing cancer in half the patients . So we have a product that can generate billions working out and is basically just a couple approvals away from the market . The stock has been shorted to the earth and is stable in the mid 20s while not_going further down . So this suggests this is the bottom so already a safe entry point . Low risk of losing any significant amounts . The price factors in lawsuits that will be settled this spring while not_factoring in any upside to literal cancer therapies . before anyone comes at me saying its just melanoma the pipeline works for any cancer and they can use that data to apply for expedited approvals for the rest of the cancer suit . lower side seems to be nonexistent while the up side seems to be 10x . What am i missing here Postion 30k shares at 27.5 Average ."

Generally I have been collecting an average of 9.5% interest on each deal, with the deals being 12 months and backed up by 50% LTV real estate. Not crazy minimums, around 25K USD. All of my investments have performed and none defaulted, pretty solid underwriting and only on commercial stuff. Here is my question…I can borrow against my investment portfolio at a 4.97% rate, risk being it is variable and tied to fed rate. Is it a completely foolish idea to borrow against this, lend the money via the hard money lender, and make the difference on the spread of the two rates?",

      "selftext": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom, market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle (ORCL.US) might issue up to $100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions. Worries over Oracle's debt situation drove its five year credit default swap (CDS) to surge to a three year high. However, BNP Paribas believes Oracle's actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $100 billion. Therefore, Oracle may only need to issue $25 billion to $35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development. While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the company's recent $18 billion bond offering, it remains far below the $100 billion level that had investors concerned. It's worth noting that given Oracle's high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business, we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden. Management could also explore alternative financing solutions (such as vendor financing) to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures. Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “Overweight” rating, but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations, some have lowered their target price from $430 to $390. Furthermore, the market currently prices Oracle's collaboration with OpenAI at only a “minimal upside.” This can be calculated: approximately 84% of Oracle's current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses. Estimates suggest Oracle's cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027. This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets.",

      "selftext_processed": "Amid the ongoing AI investment boom market concerns had previously surfaced that Oracle ORCL.US might issue up to $ 100 billion in debt to fund its AI ambitions . Worries over Oracles debt situation drove its five year credit default swap CDS to surge to a three year high . However BNP Paribas believes Oracles actual debt issuance will be significantly less than $ 100 billion . Therefore Oracle may only need to issue $ 25 billion to $ 35 billion in debt to fund its AI infrastructure development . While this additional debt issuance would come on top of the companys recent $ 18 billion bond offering it remains far below the $ 100 billion level that had investors concerned . Its worth noting that given Oracles high profit margins in its cloud infrastructure business we also have reason to believe the company can withstand a higher debt burden . Management could also explore alternative financing solutions such as vendor financing to alleviate upfront cash outlay pressures . Many institutions have already assigned Oracle an “ Overweight ” rating but due to increased capital expenditures and currency fluctuations some have lowered their target price from $ 430 to $ 390 . Furthermore the market currently prices Oracles collaboration with OpenAI at only a “ minimal upside. ” This can be calculated approximately 84 % of Oracles current market capitalization is supported by its non AI businesses . Estimates suggest Oracles cloud infrastructure business could contribute approximately $ 13 per share to earnings by fiscal year 2027 . This implies significant upside potential should the cloud infrastructure business approach its targets ."

      "selftext": "Microsoft shares dipped a bit today after a report suggested the company cut sales quotas for some of its AI software offerings. According to The Information, many sales reps in Azure’s AI unit struggled to hit last year’s growth numbers, especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents. Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft, which makes the move stand out. It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AI-agent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year. Microsoft hasn’t commented on the report yet, but if true, it might signal that the enterprise AI ramp-up is going to be more uneven than people assumed. Curious how others read this growing pains, or an early sign that AI adoption inside large companies is slower than the narrative suggests? Source :",

      "selftext_processed": "Microsoft shares dipped a bit today after a report suggested the company cut sales quotas for some of its AI software offerings . According to The Information many sales reps in Azure ’ s AI unit struggled to hit last year ’ s growth numbers especially around the Foundry product the platform companies use to build and manage AI agents . Lowering quotas is apparently unusual for Microsoft which makes the move stand out . It also raises a question about how quickly enterprise demand for these AIagent tools is actually scaling versus the expectations that were set last year . Microsoft hasn ’ t commented on the report yet but if true it might signal that the enterprise AI rampup is going to be more uneven than people assumed . Curious how others read this growing pains or an early sign that AI adoption inside large companies is slower than the narrative suggests Source"

      "selftext": "The latest ADP numbers for November paint a much weaker picture of the labor market than expected. Private employers cut 32,000 jobs, which is a big swing from October’s revised gain of 47,000 and way below the forecast of +40,000.The biggest pressure seems to be on small businesses. Companies with fewer than 50 employees shed a total of 120,000 jobs, the largest drop since March 2023. Medium and large employers actually added workers, with bigger firms showing a net gain of 90,000.Hiring was mixed across sectors. Education and health services added 33,000 jobs, and leisure/hospitality added 13,000. But those gains were offset by declines in professional/business services (-26,000), information (-20,000), manufacturing (-18,000), and financial and construction (-9,000 each). Wage growth is also cooling, with job-stayers seeing a 4.4% YoY pay increase a slight slowdown from October.This report lands right before the Fed meeting on Dec 9–10. Markets are pricing in nearly a 90% chance of another 25 bps rate cut, but Fed officials remain split: some argue easing is needed to prevent further labor weakness, while others worry cuts could push inflation the wrong way.The BLS nonfarm payrolls data, delayed to Dec 16, will be the next key datapoint.

      "title": "Macy’s drops 7% pre-market on strongest growth in 3 years while raising outlook and warning on holiday spending and tariffs",
      "selftext": "No paywall: [ >Macy’s on Wednesday beat Wall Street’s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company’s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum. >The department store operator raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook after its better-than-expected fiscal third quarter. The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $2 and $2.20, up from its previous expectation of $1.70 to $2.05, and net sales of $21.48 billion to $21.63 billion, compared with its prior outlook of $21.15 billion and $21.45 billion. >Macy’s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5% comparable sales growth from the previous year. That compares to its previous expectations for a year-over-year decline of between 0.5% and 1.5%. The industry metric takes out one-time dynamics like store openings and closures, and Macy’s includes merchandise that it owns, items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its third-party online marketplace. >It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy’s raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook. The company had cut its full-year earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs, more promotions and “some moderation” in discretionary spending. >Even so, the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the year-ago net sales of $22.29 billion. Macy’s said about $700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year, which ended Feb. 1, and in the early part of this fiscal year. >And Macy’s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter. >Shares dropped about 6% in premarket trading on Wednesday. >In an interview with CNBC, CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “prudent view” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough year-over-year comparisons and because it’s not sure how “aspirational customers,” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured, may spend during the season. >“We’re pleased with the fourth quarter to date, but we have a big holiday in front of us,” he said. >He said Macy’s department store model is an advantage during the gift-giving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices, from off-price to luxury. >Here’s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG: >Earnings per share: 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents >Revenue: $4.71 billion vs. $4.62 billion expected >Macy’s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales, particularly for its namesake brand. Macy’s department stores account for the majority of the New York City-based legacy retailer’s business, but their performance has lagged behind the company’s higher-end department store, Bloomingdale’s, and beauty chain, Bluemercury. To try to reverse that trend, the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing, sharper merchandise and eye-catching displays at Macy’s stores. It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations, which were dubbed the “First 50,” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy’s locations. That’s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy’s plans to keep open. >Along with the added investment, it has shuttered lower-performing Macy’s locations. It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027, while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. >The company hasn’t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year. >In the three-month period that ended Nov. 1, Macy’s net income fell to $11 million, or 4 cents per share, compared with $28 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Adjusting for some one-time items, including gains on the sale of real estate, it reported earnings per share of 9 cents. >Revenue decreased from $4.74 billion in the year-ago quarter. >In the fiscal third quarter, companywide comparable sales rose 3.2% including owned and licensed merchandise and its third-party marketplace. When the company excluded stores that won’t be part of its go-forward business, that growth was 3.4%. >Bloomingdale’s posted the strongest performance of the company’s brands, with comparable sales jumping 9% year over year on an owned-plus-licensed basis, including its third-party marketplace. And Bluemercury’s comparable sales increased 1.1%. >Spring attributed the company’s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy’s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like high-end home goods company MacKenzie-Childs. >He said he visited Macy’s stores, and those of its competitors, on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw. >“I like the way we’re showing up,” he said. “We look crisp. We look clean. We look interesting, compelling, inspiring, easy to shop.” >The snap to cooler weather helped, too, he said. As temperatures turned cooler in October, shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters, outerwear and boots. >For the holiday season, Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the year-ago period at Macy’s stores and website, along with those of its competitors. >Higher tariffs, however, will mean higher prices for some items. Macy’s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties, and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected, he said. >Still, Spring said Macy’s has made “selective” price increases in almost every category, with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs. >As of Tuesday’s close, Macy’s shares have risen about 34% so far this year. That outpaces the S&P 500′s 16% gains during the same period. Macy’s stock closed Tuesday at $22.71, bringing the company’s market cap to about $6.10 billion.",

      "selftext_processed": "No_paywall Macy ’ s on Wednesday beat Wall Street ’ s sales expectations for the third quarter in a row and posted its strongest growth in more than three years as the company ’ s turnaround strategy showed signs of momentum . The department store operator raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook after its betterthanexpected fiscal third quarter . The retailer now expects adjusted earnings per share of between $ 2 and $ 2.20 up from its previous expectation of $ 1.70 to $ 2.05 and net sales of $ 21.48 billion to $ 21.63 billion compared with its prior outlook of $ 21.15 billion and $ 21.45 billion . Macy ’ s said it expects flat to roughly 0.5 % comparable sales growth from the previous year . That compares to its previous expectations for a yearoveryear decline of between 0.5 % and 1.5 % . The industry metric takes out onetime dynamics like store openings and closures and Macy ’ s includes merchandise that it owns items for brands that pay for space within its stores and its thirdparty online marketplace . It marked the second consecutive quarter Macy ’ s raised its fullyear sales and earnings outlook . The company had cut its fullyear earnings outlook in May because of higher tariffs more promotions and “ some moderation ” in discretionary spending . Even so the projected annual sales would represent a drop from the yearago net sales of $ 22.29 billion . Macy ’ s said about $ 700 million of that annual net sales decrease is due to the 64 stores it shuttered at the end of the last fiscal year which ended Feb. 1 and in the early part of this fiscal year . And Macy ’ s said in its news release that its outlook anticipates two challenging dynamics – selective spending by consumers and higher tariffs – will persist in the holiday quarter . Shares dropped about 6 % in premarket trading on Wednesday . In an interview with CNBC CEO Tony Spring said the company is taking a “ prudent view ” of the fourth quarter because it faces tough yearoveryear comparisons and because it ’ s not_sure how “ aspirational customers ” those who like to shop at its stores but are more financially pressured may spend during the season . “ We ’ re pleased with the fourth quarter to date but we have a big holiday in front of us ” he said . He said Macy ’ s department store model is an advantage during the giftgiving season because it offers a wide variety of merchandise and a range of prices from offprice to luxury . Here ’ s how the department store operator did during its fiscal third quarter compared with what Wall Street expected based on a survey of analysts by LSEG Earnings per share 9 cents adjusted vs. an expected loss of 14 cents Revenue $ 4.71 billion vs. $ 4.62 billion expected Macy ’ s is trying to put up better and more consistent sales particularly for its namesake brand . Macy ’ s department stores account for the majority of the New York Citybased legacy retailer ’ s business but their performance has lagged behind the company ’ s higherend department store Bloomingdale ’ s and beauty chain Bluemercury . To try to reverse that trend the retailer has stepped up investments in staffing sharper merchandise and eyecatching displays at Macy ’ s stores . It first rolled out that strategy at 50 locations which were dubbed the “ First 50 ” and has since expanded that approach to a total of 125 Macy ’ s locations . That ’ s more than a third of the 350 namesake stores that Macy ’ s plans to keep open . Along with the added investment it has shuttered lowerperforming Macy ’ s locations . It announced in early 2024 that it would permanently close about 150 of its namesake stores by early 2027 while planning to add locations for Bloomingdale ’ s and Bluemercury . The company hasn ’ t yet said how many additional stores it may close this fiscal year . In the threemonth period that ended Nov. 1 Macy ’ s net income fell to $ 11 million or 4 cents per share compared with $ 28 million or 10 cents per share in the yearago period . Adjusting for some onetime items including gains on the sale of real estate it reported earnings per share of 9 cents . Revenue decreased from $ 4.74 billion in the yearago quarter . In the fiscal third quarter companywide comparable sales rose 3.2 % including owned and licensed merchandise and its thirdparty marketplace . When the company excluded stores that won ’ t be part of its goforward business that growth was 3.4 % . Bloomingdale ’ s posted the strongest performance of the company ’ s brands with comparable sales jumping 9 % year over year on an ownedpluslicensed basis including its thirdparty marketplace . And Bluemercury ’ s comparable sales increased 1.1 % . Spring attributed the company ’ s better performance to shoppers responding to changes that Macy ’ s has made to its legacy department stores – such as additional staff ready to help and newer brands like highend home goods company MacKenzieChilds . He said he visited Macy ’ s stores and those of its competitors on Black Friday and was pleased by what he saw . “ I like the way we ’ re showing up ” he said . “ We look crisp . We look clean . We look interesting compelling inspiring easy to shop. ” The snap to cooler weather helped too he said . As temperatures turned cooler in October shoppers bought items including cashmere sweaters outerwear and boots . For the holiday season Spring said he expects promotions to be at similar levels to the yearago period at Macy ’ s stores and website along with those of its competitors . Higher tariffs however will mean higher prices for some items . Macy ’ s has worked with vendors and manufacturers to blunt the impact of the duties and the hit to margins in the third quarter came was lower than the company expected he said . Still Spring said Macy ’ s has made “ selective ” price increases in almost every category with some items costing more because of improved quality or an added embellishment and some simply due to higher import costs . As of Tuesday ’ s close Macy ’ s shares have risen about 34 % so far this year . That outpaces the SP 500′s 16 % gains during the same period . Macy ’ s stock closed Tuesday at $ 22.71 bringing the company ’ s market cap to about $ 6.10 billion ."

      "selftext": "* The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum, and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 4:49:11 PM EST. * BMNR price increased by 10.26% yesterday. * Today's Fusaka update marks Ethereum's second major network enhancement of 2025, following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th, which sparked a 29% rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations. * The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits, expanding transaction capacity per block (increasing TPS), and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling. This makes the network more secure, faster, more efficient, and with lower gas fees. A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets. It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure, \"bank-grade\" hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor. * This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further, with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster. * Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $7,000 and $9,000 by early 2026, with a near-term downside to $2,500. But the downside is minor compared to the upside. * Today, the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act, a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming near-term catalysts for BMNR after today's Fusaka upgrade: * A probable Fed rate cut (CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8% chance of a 25-bp cut) next Wednesday will increase liquidity. * The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17, 2025, with a bipartisan vote, and the bill has moved to the Senate. The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption, particularly among banks and the Fed. * Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system. Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNR's underlying largest asset. * Made in America Validator Network (MAVAN) for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026. * Achieving the Alchemy of 5% would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem, enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve. BMNR currently owns more than 3% of the total ETH. * Moonshots, which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network * Increasing Institutional Ownership",

      "selftext_processed": "The BMNR price often correlates with ETH being the largest treasury holder of Ethereum and ETH is set to undergo its biggest update today at 44911 PM EST . BMNR price increased by 10.26 % yesterday . Todays Fusaka update marks Ethereums second major network enhancement of 2025 following the Pectra fork that set new standards in validator operations on May 7th which sparked a 29 % rally in ETH and established new standards for validator operations . The upgrade enhances security by imposing stricter computational limits expanding transaction capacity per block increasing TPS and introducing Peer Data Availability Sampling . This makes the network more secure faster more efficient and with lower gas fees . A key feature of the Fusaka upgrade is a change that allows iPhone and Android devices to be used more easily and securely as hardware wallets for Ethereum assets . It enables billions of smartphones to function as secure bankgrade hardware wallets without users needing to purchase separate physical devices like a Ledger or Trezor . This will accelerate the adoption of Ethereum even further with Ethereum dominating the remaining market shares of other similar tokens even faster . Tom Lee predicts ETH is likely to surge between $ 7000 and $ 9000 by early 2026 with a nearterm downside to $ 2500 . But the downside is minor compared to the upside . Today the Chiefs of BlackRock and Coinbase dismiss fears of a coming crypto winter . BlackRock CEO Larry Fink has called for Congress to pass the CLARITY Act a piece of crypto legislation to provide regulatory clarity for digital assets Upcoming nearterm catalysts for BMNR after todays Fusaka upgrade A probable Fed rate cut CME FedWatch currently shows an 88.8 % chance of a 25bp cut next Wednesday will increase liquidity . The CLARITY Act was passed by the House of Representatives on July 17 2025 with a bipartisan vote and the bill has moved to the Senate . The CLARITY Act or a similar Act is necessary to establish a regulatory framework for broader adoption particularly among banks and the Fed . Tokenization and Stablecoins can become a significant and huge chunk of the financial system . Multiple major institutions are launching their own Stablecoins that utilize BMNRs underlying largest asset . Made in America Validator Network MAVAN for staking and earning yields is expected to go live in Q1 2026 . Achieving the Alchemy of 5 % would make BMNR a significant force in the Ethereum ecosystem enabling more influential control and utilization of their Ethereum reserve . BMNR currently owns more than 3 % of the total ETH . Moonshots which involve strategic investments in innovative projects designed to support and enhance the Ethereum network Increasing Institutional Ownership"

The rebound from Tuesday seems to be holding, even with mixed signals coming from manufacturing data, holiday spending, and the broader macro picture. The Fed narrative is shifting again: interviews for Powell’s potential successor were reportedly cancelled, which has strengthened expectations that Kevin Hassett who’s generally viewed as a rate-cut supporter could take over next year. That’s adding another layer to the rate-cut speculation already building. Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week’s meeting have climbed to 87%, up sharply from 63% a month ago. Today’s focus is on incoming data: ADP jobs report, expected to show very soft hiring (10k vs 42k prior). ISM services, especially the prices-paid and employment components. Industrial production also on the radar. With official government jobs data landing only after next week’s Fed decision, the market is relying more heavily on private reports than usual.",

That ’ s adding another layer to the ratecut speculation already building . Market expectations for a 25 bps cut at next week ’ s meeting have climbed to 87 % up sharply from 63 % a month ago . Today ’ s focus is on incoming data ADP jobs report expected to show very soft hiring 10k vs 42k prior . ISM services especially the pricespaid and employment components .

      "selftext": "10 months ago I posted a DD on Intel in here on why Intel is going to go big. Back then the price was at 22.5$ and I had 3k shares. Fast forward to 10 months later and I increased my position to 10.100 shares for an average of 23.5$ and now Intel is at 43.5$. This thing can and, if macro allows, will go a lot higher. We have CES 2026 coming up early January where the Panther Lake chips will be fully revealed on 18A and benchmarks are already promising, then we have rumors about incoming foundry deals and lately a lot of demand for EMIB which is specialized chip packaging. Also Intels discrete GPU division is also looking better than ever (note on this is that we do have to find out how nvidia deal will affect this in the future). Currently Intel is at only \\~60% of AMD's market cap while making over two times their revenue. When more of Intels in house chips move to in-house fabbing margins will increase a lot because they don't have to pay TSMC 50% profit margins anymore. Flight potential for this stock is absurd and insanely assymetrical, even after the jump over the past few months. In nana we trust.",

      "selftext": "Weekly mortgage data came in with a pretty mixed picture. The average 30-year fixed rate for conforming loans ($806,500 or below) ticked down to 6.32%, from 6.40% the week prior. Despite lower rates, refinance applications fell 4%, which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels. On the other hand, purchase applications rose 3%, suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets. Overall, rates drifting lower is good news, but the demand response is still pretty uneven. It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior.

The average 30year fixed rate for conforming loans $ 806500 or below ticked down to 6.32 % from 6.40 % the week prior . Despite lower rates refinance applications fell 4 % which probably says a lot about how few homeowners actually benefit at these levels . On the other hand purchase applications rose 3 % suggesting buyers are slowly stepping back in as monthly payments improve though affordability remains tight in most markets . Overall rates drifting lower is good news but the demand response is still pretty uneven . It feels like the market is waiting for a more meaningful drop before we see a real shift in behavior .

Yeah, their finances look terrible, yeah the sentiment towards them among online communities is bad BUT I see 2 things that are likely to happen. Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout, or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own (Assassins Creed, Far Cry, Tom Clancy, Rayman, Prince of Persia etc.) they could completely turn around their financial results. Now I'm not saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I don't think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think. I would like to hear why I'm stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into.",

Yeah their finances look terrible yeah the sentiment towards them among online communities is bad BUT I see 2 things that are likely to happen . Either the company is bought by some other company which would probably earn me some money based on how other companies stocks behaved during buyout or they fix their managment in which case with a strong lineup of brands they own Assassins Creed Far Cry Tom Clancy Rayman Prince of Persia etc . they could completely turn around their financial results . Now Im not_saying Ubisoft would have the easiest time having a comeback but I dont think their problems are as hard to solve as people seem to think . I would like to hear why Im stupid if I am missing something but the stock does look tempting to throw a few thousand into ."

      "selftext": "Hey guys, 22M here. I’m current sitting on $24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up. I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on, and want to start thinking a bit more long term. I previously thought of going 60% nasdaq and 40% all world, but at my age this seems a bit too boring. I want to be a bit more risky until age 25-30 before I start to get super safe with my investments. So I was thinking 100% Mag-7. Like I mentioned i’ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk, and this would be for long term holding. I would contribute around $600/month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction, then would go all in with the $24k (into Mag-7, and save about 20% for some high risk AI/Nuclear/Quantum plays). Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i’m not missing anything important, besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride. Thanks",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey guys 22M here . I ’ m current sitting on $ 24k and recently cashed out on most of my individual stocks after this previous AI run up . I want to move this money into something a bit more safer than reddit stocks that I clearly got a bit lucky on and want to start thinking a bit more long term . I previously thought of going 60 % nasdaq and 40 % all world but at my age this seems a bit too boring . I want to be a bit more risky until age 2530 before I start to get super safe with my investments . So I was thinking 100 % Mag7 . Like I mentioned i ’ ve been pretty much gambling on reddit stocks for the past 3 years so can take a bit of risk and this would be for long term holding . I would contribute around $ 600month to this starting from this month and want to sit on most of my cash until a big correction then would go all in with the $ 24k into Mag7 and save about 20 % for some high risk AINuclearQuantum plays . Wanted to get some more experienced thoughts on this to make sure i ’ m not_missing anything important besides from the fact that it would be a pretty bumpy ride . Thanks"

      "selftext": "Hello all! My parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&P-500-level returns with a little diversification. They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week. Here’s the rough allocation we’re considering: U.S. Large Cap (S&P-ish): SCHX – 40% Total U.S. Market: SCHB – 30% Developed International: SCHF – 10% Emerging Markets: SCHE – 5% U.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10% TIPS: SCHP – 5% All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab. Questions: 1. Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately? 2. Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)? 3. Would a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate? 4. Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY? Thanks in advance for any input.",

      "selftext": "Here's my situation. I've got about $900K in a non-IRA (Schwab) in an Irrevocable Trust (I'm the sole Beneficiary & Trustee if that matters - the Trust itself is complex, but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it). I want to get a line-of-credit loan of perhaps $150K, that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution (where I have about $700K) whenever I feel like it's time to ring the register on some position there. Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate). (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL) If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns. I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%). I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing. Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money. I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan. I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

Ive got about $ 900K in a nonIRA Schwab in an Irrevocable Trust Im the sole Beneficiary Trustee if that matters the Trust itself is complex but pretty much allows me to do what I want with it . I want to get a lineofcredit loan of perhaps $ 150K that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution where I have about $ 700K whenever I feel like its time to ring the register on some position there . Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now or soon will be longterm unrealized gains because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150 % of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver94 % plan I cant extract the gains indeed some of these gains are 6X so most of the proceeds would be gains and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare i.e . the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150 % would be equivalent to a 25 % implicit tax rate . I could retain the income in the Trust but that would be at a 23.8 % haircut 20 % longterm capgains 3.8 % ACA tax oh the irony LOL If it matters this $ 150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house for my personal residence use on a property that the Trust owns . I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab but the interest rate is ridiculous like 11 % . I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25 % but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there as well as them having notsogood_service although since I wouldnt be doing much I guess it wouldnt be a big thing . Any transfer would be to my Trust nonIRA actually checking account associated with the Trust nonIRA at Schwab which is the account that I would be using to spend the money . I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB and he got something like 6 % on a loan although this wasnt a Trust account and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan . I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower my own financial situation is irrelevant for the record my credit score is A but of course my official income is very low LOL ."

      "selftext": "Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest. Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. Still, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile. [Link to article](",

      "title": "Tesla x Michael Burry x Musk lies",
      "selftext": "You don't need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musk's LIES. Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla. Let’s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed. Feel free to verify each statement yourself :) Long story short, Burry said has an history of going all-in in whatever sounds cool, rarely following up on promises and that competition wins. Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 2020/2021. He then moved to full-self driving as its \"main goal\", but Google’s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4. Tesla? 20 cars that still need supervision (level 2+) but hear me out, he's gonna DOUBLE it to 40 by late December. Ready for the misleading headlines \"Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network\" ??? So after failing with this, he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots. Last year he promised by the end of this year he'd produce 5000 robots. Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that’s just what he dies. He got his Trillion dollar package, he's good. In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality... so, as Burry said, the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elon's total addressable market. Now, I personally don't trust a management who doesn't offer reliable projections. When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls, their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up. Just take note, for each company, of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters, set it on your calendar to check back on it and you’ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don’t have time to listen/read all of the guidance, copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto :) ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious, never overpromises and often overdelivers. That's a company you can trust. That's a company who's CEO words are worth something while Elon's at this point is just toilet paper. Guy is not a genius, he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is. This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world. Then he takes all the credit, as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is. You don't need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud, you just need to actually listen what he says and how he's just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says. He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved, the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and ego-driven adventures against OpenAI, , and whomever proved to be better than him at executing. To be complete, here's the list of unmet promises: - $25000 family car: promised in 2006. January 2025 he confirmed production would start, later scrapped the plan in April 2025. - Cheaper models announced late 2024: delayed to prioritize Cybertruck (which was a complete failure) - Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production. Delayed every year since then, new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered. - New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production, Delayed every year since then. - Unsupervised full self driving in Austin: promised by June 2025, still not achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size. - Large-scale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles: bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far. - Self-delivering teslas: promised by 2019, never realized. IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER I'm not saying you should sell. Just stay informed, read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock. You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk, knowing there's a history of missing deadlines, promises and flip-flop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail. The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true, but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon. Ignore people with aggressive ideas, they are just desperate Read the comments, you’ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts.

Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 20202021 . He then moved to fullself driving as its main goal but Google ’ s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4 . Tesla 20 cars that still need supervision level 2 but hear me out hes gon na DOUBLE it to 40 by late December . Ready for the misleading headlines Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network So after failing with this he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots . Last year he promised by the end of this year hed produce 5000 robots . Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that ’ s just what he dies . He got his Trillion dollar package hes good . In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality ... so as Burry said the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elons total addressable market . Now I personally dont trust a management who doesnt offer reliable projections . When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up . Just take note for each company of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters set it on your calendar to check back on it and you ’ ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don ’ t have time to listenread all of the guidance copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious never_overpromises and often overdelivers . Thats a company you can trust . Thats a company whos CEO words are worth something while Elons at this point is just toilet paper . Guy is not_a genius he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is . This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world . Then he takes all the credit as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is . You dont need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud you just need to actually listen what he says and how hes just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says . He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and egodriven adventures against OpenAI and whomever proved to be better than him at executing . To be complete heres the list of unmet promises $ 25000 family car promised in 2006 . January 2025 he confirmed production would start later scrapped the plan in April 2025 . Cheaper models announced late 2024 delayed to prioritize Cybertruck which was a complete failure Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production . Delayed every year since then new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered . New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production Delayed every year since then . Unsupervised full self driving in Austin promised by June 2025 still not_achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size . Largescale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far . Selfdelivering teslas promised by 2019 never_realized . IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER Im not_saying you should sell . Just stay informed read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock . You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk knowing theres a history of missing deadlines promises and flipflop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail . The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon . Ignore people with aggressive ideas they are just desperate Read the comments you ’ ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts . Stay safe stay invested Credits to Ettore Mihaili from Netherlands"

      "selftext": "Anthropic has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to begin work on one of the largest initial public offerings ever, which could come as soon as 2026, as the artificial intelligence start-up races OpenAI to the public market. The maker of the Claude chatbot, which is in talks for a private funding round that would value it at more than $300bn, chose the US west coast law firm in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, had also discussed a potential IPO with big investment banks, according to multiple people with knowledge of those talks. The people characterised the discussions as preliminary and informal, suggesting that the company was not close to picking its IPO underwriters. Nonetheless, these moves represent a significant step up in Anthropic’s preparations for an IPO that would test the appetite of public markets to back the massive, lossmaking research labs at the heart of the AI boom. Wilson Sonsini has advised Anthropic since 2022, including on multibillion-dollar investments from Amazon, and has worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft. Its investors are enthusiastic about an IPO, arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first. Sources: FINANCIAL TIMES/ Reuter",

      "selftext": "While commercial property may go vacant somewhere, its rising in profit elseware. Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease. In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years. But unlike a shop in a mall, such as dillards or sears - simon is much less exposed than people think. The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use - the mall near me for example, houses a city police unit and a church. Im not looking at this from a consumer perspective - instead seeing it as an investment in best-in-class commercial real estate and adaptable management. The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary - as value was lost over speculative concern regarding e-commerce and terrifs. Which as seen in the earnings report, was almost a non factor. The stock fell due to irrelevant fud, and is due to make returns to its original trend line. 220-250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term, and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory, its already a proven success.. Cliff: SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no direct stake in the success of retail - its an asset management company, not a clothing store.",

Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease . In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years . But unlike a shop in a mall such as dillards or sears simon is much less exposed than people think . The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not_in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use the mall near me for example houses a city police unit and a church . Im not_looking at this from a consumer perspective instead seeing it as an investment in bestinclass commercial real estate and adaptable management . The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary as value was lost over speculative concern regarding ecommerce and terrifs . Which as seen in the earnings report was almost a non factor . The stock fell due to irrelevant fud and is due to make returns to its original trend line . 220250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory its already a proven success .. Cliff SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no_direct stake in the success of retail its an asset management company not_a clothing store ."

In this inflationary speculative environment AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, are all given premium valuations with 40-120x pe and can still be considered fair value. TSMC is sitting at a \"healthy\" tech sector pe of anywhere around 28-30 day to day. They have a PEG of around 1, far better than AMD and is instep with NVIDA, and have operating margins on par with NVIDIA as well at 50%. Their revenues, margins, growth is exemplary and honestly criminally undervalued in such a inflationary AI environment. Are there any other reasons besides hostilities from China why TSMC hasnt gone side by side with Nvidia in growth? I'm No analyst and really am your every day idiot retail investor who absolutely fucking loves to by high sell low.

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%. A little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up. But, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? Thank you!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all I ’ ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I ’ m still unsure what makes the most sense financially . From what I ’ ve read the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate . Seems like 6 % is sort of the grey area . Ours is 5.75 % . A little over a year ago I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I ’ ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully pretty much at all to retirement and savings . Right now I ’ m maxing my Roth IRA HSA and 401k . We also just bought a house with a 5.75 % mortgage . From what I understand investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75 % in the long run like 8 % so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing . I feel a bit behind in savings for my age 31 and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up . But I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later . I ’ m wondering if it ’ s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns or if there are other factors I should consider . Maybe it is best to do some of both Thank you"

      "title": "Trump expects the Federal Reserve chair nominee to be announced “early next year” and praised Hassett.",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank. “We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting. Last week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting. “I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.” Trump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas. The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.” However, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell. For months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively. Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years. In September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer. The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank . “ We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year ” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting . Last week sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesdays cabinet meeting . “ I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too ” Trump said . “ I dont know who qualifies for the word ‘ potential. ’ I can tell you hes a respected individual . Thank you Kevin. ” Trumps remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement . Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold who has overseen the selection process previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas . The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik he had considered about 10 candidates for the position but now “ weve narrowed it down to one person. ” However it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions meaning the nomination can not be considered final until formally announced . Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh and BlackRocks Rick Riddell . For months Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells term expires in May and appointing his successor will be Trumps biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed . Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively . Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday calling him a “ stubborn guy who probably doesnt like your president. ” Although Powells term as chairman ends next year he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years . In September Trump explicitly named Hassett Wash and Waller as his top three candidates . Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer . The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank . However Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters . Additionally the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trumps attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook . Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation . If the nominee is an outsider they are likely to receive a 14year term as a Fed governor beginning February 1 ."

      "selftext": "The Verge, Dec 2, 2025 Google’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off. The tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in. In the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said. There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development. The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.

      "selftext_processed": "The Verge Dec 2 2025 Google ’ s own ‘ code red ’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off . The tides are turning in the AI race and the pressure is getting to OpenAI . Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “ code red ” on Monday urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT an indicator that the startup ’ s onceunassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in . In the memo reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads shopping and health agents and a personal assistant Pulse to focus on improving ChatGPT . This includes core features like greater speed and reliability better personalization and the ability to answer more questions he said . There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot the memo said and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development . The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability . It is also something of a fullcircle moment in the AI race . Google which declared its own “ code red ” after the arrival of ChatGPT is a particular concern . Google ’ s AI user base is growing helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model and its latest AI model Gemini 3 blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics .

I am trying to cash it out in his name (he has medical problems, and still alive), and the bank said that it needs to be digitized; no problem. I got the forms to get it digitized from Computershare, however I still have questions. According to computershare I have to send it to them in the states (the actual certificate), and I think make an account for him-which I did (the people were not helpful at all). I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form: a letter of authorization to transfer security to non-register account. So my question is should I still send the certificate to computer share along with the the paperwork or should I just send the certificate to the bank he using now?",

I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form a letter of authorization to transfer security to nonregister account . So my question is should I still send the certificate to computer share along with the the paperwork or should I just send the certificate to the bank he using now"

      "selftext": "I've read the books about investments like \"The Simple Path to Wealth\" and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people, performance, reputation, sales. Or rather *MADE* sense, back those days when not your every neighbor was an \"investor\" with a collection of stocks on their apps. And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not so well. Now coming to our days: people just invest monthly into MAG7/S&P500/etc doesn't matter are they doing good or bad(just look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation). Americans do their 401k, Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks. This is a huge and constant inflow of money. That is *NOT* based on any analysis, but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this, trying to escape inflation losses and get rich. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x. This is an enormous inflation. It's common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi. Now could you shed a light, how stock markets are different in a broad sense, if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier? **EDIT** Thanks to everyone for the answers, maybe I should've worded it clearer that my misconception/assumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index (like the S&P 500), they aren't looking at the individual stock's value. The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis, making it seem like a closed loop - a \"Ponzi scheme\" where the only buyers are the index funds themselves. u/[stuporman86]( and others brought great points here, that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here: \\- funds vs direct holdings: even though passive funds recently exceeded 50% of the money held in investment funds, funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment. The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings. This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching, selecting, and trading individual stocks and it' is crucial for setting prices based on value, not just automated buying. \\- economic studies suggest that a \"slim minority\" of informed, active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery",

      "selftext": "Disclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows: Since inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues: -Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators. -Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders. -Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better. -Ad stack worst-in-class. -Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure. -Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power. -Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe. SNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below: -Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense. -Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers. -They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue. -They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide. SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive. What investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout. Regarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come. As for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results. In conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclosure long 250000 shares at $ 7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike postQ3 earnings making about $ 200k . However I now look at SNAP as more of a longerterm investment and my thesis follows Since inception SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can ’ t make money which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do . It faces the following issues Founders control the voting rights and haven ’ t been the best capital allocators . Egregious stockbased comp has diluted shareholders . Best features like Stories copied by META and monetized much better . Ad stack worstinclass . Very high operating costs mainly due to infrastructure . Young users hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power . Growing fast mainly in lowincome countries like Indian and Pakistan yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe . SNAP as Spiegel mentioned recently is at a crossroads . It can die a slow unprofitable death or it can innovate and start to make money for once . It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now and I will mention why below Started offering various subscriptions including Snapchat Memories Storage Lens and Platinum . Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $ 750 million year for now and is growing double digits which is unique among its peers . I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center such as Icloud storage Google etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there . The download and import process isn ’ t that easy and there will be friction . A certain number of users will say “ screw it I ’ ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it ” . Meanwhile the users that do not_pay for it will be limited in storage thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense . Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement . After all what use is having hordes of users if you can not make money off of them Sometimes you indeed have to “ fire ” your customers . They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature as well as Sponsored Snaps with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages . The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not_vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue . They recently reorganized into small nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy . The Snapchat success was created by a small team for example so they decided to scale this operationally companywide . SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “ thing ” I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology . They have the most used AR products in the world and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year . Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves which is also a positive as I don ’ t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account . Personally I do not_feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success mainly because SNAP has no_record of being successful in hardware . I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well . If they bomb then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward which would also be a positive . What investors need to think about is this How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU SNAP has that yet only has a $ 13 billion market cap . Ideally the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials . Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs a better ads platform and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically . However I ’ m not_playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares and a takeover won ’ t happen unless they want it to happen . More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout . Regarding stockbased comp dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped and while it is still relatively high management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked . They recently announced a $ 500 million buyback and I think we will see more to come . As for the recent $ 400 million Perplexity deal I see it as a oneoff and don ’ t ascribe much value to it for now especially since Evan said they won ’ t sell advertising against the chatbot results . In conclusion I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year . I don ’ t have a target price on the stock per se but it could become a $ 100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should ."

      "selftext": "Honestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking. It’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down. And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice? Idk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “ confidence ” “ sentiment ” “ vibes ” whatever you wan na call it . Earnings matter yeah interest rates matter yeah but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it ’ s worth buying . People hold because they trust it ’ ll go back up . People panic because they think someone else is panicking . It ’ s like one giant circular trust fall . Everyone is basically agreeing not_to look down . And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense Like not_a normal recession or correction but a day where enough people say “ nah I ’ m done trusting this casino. ” Would everything just… unwind Would indexes tank for years Would governments step in and force something Or does the system somehow survive because it ’ s too big to fail like people will keep believing simply because they have no_choice Idk maybe I ’ m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is . Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating"

Bitget and other plateforme are already running large-scale tokenized stock futures, while the Nasdaq is still waiting on SEC approval before it can offer its own tokenized stock offerings.

      "selftext": "Amazon is officially pushing deeper into the AI chip war. Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon. The pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it. But there’s a catch. Trainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet. Iis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

Their cloud unit just launched Trainium3 a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia ’ s GPUs at least according to Amazon . The pitch seems clear companies want cheaper AI compute and Nvidia ’ s pricing demand backlog is still insane . If Amazon can offer decent performance for less there ’ s definitely a market for it . But there ’ s a catch . Trainium3 doesn ’ t have anything close to Nvidia ’ s software ecosystem . CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats and they ’ re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything . Amazon doesn ’ t have that luxury yet . Iis Nvidia ’ s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lockin or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware"

I have a post-tax account and a pre-tax Traditional IRA. The post-tax account is mainly comprised of ETF's while the pre-tax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks. I want to move the money to something like FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index) with maybe a little bit of FSPSX (Fidelity International Index) for international exposure, and maybe just a touch of FTBFX (Fidelity Total Bond) for balancing purposes - although probably unnecessary right now. Set, forget, and make auto-contributions monthly. Never look at it. This is long term, I am very confident I won't need the money for 20+ years. 1. For the post-tax account, is the easiest (and/or only) way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETF's, withdraw the cash to my bank account, and then re-buy the Index Funds under my self-managed account? I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season. 2. For the Traditional IRA I obviously cannot withdraw the cash, so how would this one work? Thanks.",

I have a posttax account and a pretax Traditional IRA . The posttax account is mainly comprised of ETFs while the pretax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks . I want to move the money to something like FSKAX Fidelity Total Market Index with maybe a little bit of FSPSX Fidelity International Index for international exposure and maybe just a touch of FTBFX Fidelity Total Bond for balancing purposes although probably unnecessary right now . Set forget and make autocontributions monthly . Never_look at it . This is long term I am very confident I wont need the money for 20 years . 1 . For the posttax account is the easiest andor only way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETFs withdraw the cash to my bank account and then rebuy the Index Funds under my selfmanaged account I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season . 2 . For the Traditional IRA I obviously can not withdraw the cash so how would this one work Thanks ."

      "selftext": "Traditionally, we bought stocks because we believed the companies were undervalued with solid growth potential, and we hoped other investors would eventually recognize the same to drive demand & prices higher together. Or we invested in companies trading at fair value where dividends provided steady, long-term returns. But recently, the dynamics seem to have shifted. It feels like we’re buying simply because we expect prices will always go up - fueled by the endless cycle of liquidity and “cash printing.” This creates a circular loop that price going up is both the cause and effect! It gives me some ponzi-like vibes and makes me nervous. On top of that, modern markets are heavily influenced by algo trading. These systems aren’t evaluating fundamentals at all but reacting to price action, volatility, order flow, and momentum. When algos chase momentum, they basically accelerate both rallies and selloffs, further disconnecting prices from underlying company performance. To conclude my question, fundamentals seem to matter lesser and lesser. Looking ahead, I see two possible futures: 1. The market corrects and shifts back toward fundamentals-driven, conventional trading. I could see Michael Burry and other big shorts betting on this 2. We accept a new normal where fundamentals are permanently down-weighted, and liquidity flows + momentum dominate price action. Honestly it feels like we’re drifting here already because analysts keep using higher and higher P/E targets, and people seem to just accept it. What are your thoughts?",

      "selftext_processed": "Traditionally we bought stocks because we believed the companies were undervalued with solid growth potential and we hoped other investors would eventually recognize the same to drive demand prices higher together . Or we invested in companies trading at fair value where dividends provided steady longterm returns . But recently the dynamics seem to have shifted . It feels like we ’ re buying simply because we expect prices will always go up fueled by the endless cycle of liquidity and “ cash printing. ” This creates a circular loop that price going up is both the cause and effect It gives me some ponzilike vibes and makes me nervous . On top of that modern markets are heavily influenced by algo trading . These systems aren ’ t evaluating fundamentals at all but reacting to price action volatility order flow and momentum . When algos chase momentum they basically accelerate both rallies and selloffs further disconnecting prices from underlying company performance . To conclude my question fundamentals seem to matter lesser and lesser . Looking ahead I see two possible futures 1 . The market corrects and shifts back toward fundamentalsdriven conventional trading . I could see Michael Burry and other big shorts betting on this 2 . We accept a new normal where fundamentals are permanently downweighted and liquidity flows momentum dominate price action . Honestly it feels like we ’ re drifting here already because analysts keep using higher and higher PE targets and people seem to just accept it . What are your thoughts"

      "selftext": "\"NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share.\" --- The Synopsis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software runs on Intel and AMD CPUs. This chess move by NVDA will shift the R&D hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs, thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA. The rest of the Mag7 (AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL and TSLA) are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon (Trainium, M-series, MTIA, Maia, TPU and AI5/6). The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat. Exciting times ahead!",

      "selftext": "Chinese electric vehicle companies have been drawing a lot of attention lately. Take XPeng for example, their earnings have shown consistent growth, yet the stock has struggled to find traction in recent period. It makes me wonder how other investors are thinking about this space. Do you see Chinese EVs as a solid longterm play, betting on continued adoption and tech leadership? Or is the market volatility and geopolitical uncertainty too risky to go longterm? For those holding these stocks, how are you positioning yourself, and which names are you watching most closely in this sector?",

      "selftext": "# Today, December 2nd, 2025 Hello again, it's the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the S&P500 is going to be positive for the year. I now have $18,421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $10,000 into it via the mega-backdoor method. I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $10,000 extra being converted in, but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback. Before the rebalance, accounting for the $10,000 coming in, my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions, which is basically no leverage. After rebalancing, my leverage sat near 2.2x. Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down. For this quarter I'm actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being. The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73% per Aswath Damodaran from NYU. Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below, it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below <4%. The authors did not explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4%, but it is pretty implied. How this impacts my performance in the long term is not known as this was not evaluated by the authors at the time of the book's publication. Unfortunately, this de-leverage change is occurring after a pullback, which can hurt my short-term performance, but in the long run it should all equal out (hopefully). Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information, not driven by fear or greed, suggests otherwise. Background * Currently 28 years old Reasons: 1. Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage. 2. The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0% invested into stocks by saying that in today's times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium (which I believe sits around 5% depending on which source you use) to determine whether to de-leverage. 1. In general, when the equity risk premium is <3% this indicates bonds may be a better investment, 4-6% suggests a 60/40 or a 70/30 stock to bond allocation, and >6% suggests potentially having a 100% stock portfolio. You will generally only see >6% during market downturns or recessions. 3. I am 28 years old. At this age per the book, I should still maintain my 2x leverage, however given the equity risk premium of <4%, I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being. Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy. Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise. That's all for this quarter, see you in March. \\--- Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months). [ Performance: Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64 Current investment: $18,421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far: Processing $10,161 Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement. **What Is Lifecycle Investing?** Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk. How to do this: * First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share. * Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs * Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real estate and cash as retirement nears. * Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter. Essentially, you're looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x **My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation** 06/2025: With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also, you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). **Plan** * Quarterly Recalculation: * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share. * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s. 1. De-leverage Schedule: * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage. * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase. * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation. * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches. **Risk Management and Contingencies** * Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage. * Market extremes: ~~If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.~~ * Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors. * Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal. **Summary** I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28-year-old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years. **Extensive Summary** I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Today December 2nd 2025 Hello again its the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the SP500 is going to be positive for the year . I now have $ 18421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $ 10000 into it via the megabackdoor method . I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $ 10000 extra being converted in but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback . Before the rebalance accounting for the $ 10000 coming in my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions which is basically no_leverage . After rebalancing my leverage sat near 2.2x . Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down . For this quarter Im actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being . The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73 % per Aswath Damodaran from NYU . Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below 4 % . The authors did not_explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4 % but it is pretty implied . How this impacts my performance in the long term is not_known as this was not_evaluated by the authors at the time of the books publication . Unfortunately this deleverage change is occurring after a pullback which can hurt my shortterm performance but in the long run it should all equal out hopefully . Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information not_driven by fear or greed suggests otherwise . Background Currently 28 years old Reasons 1 . Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage . 2 . The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0 % invested into stocks by saying that in todays times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium which I believe sits around 5 % depending on which source you use to determine whether to deleverage . 1 . In general when the equity risk premium is 3 % this indicates bonds may be a better investment 46 % suggests a 6040 or a 7030 stock to bond allocation and 6 % suggests potentially having a 100 % stock portfolio . You will generally only see 6 % during market downturns or recessions . 3 . I am 28 years old . At this age per the book I should still maintain my 2x leverage however given the equity risk premium of 4 % I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being . Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy . Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise . Thats all for this quarter see you in March . Please see below for the current information regarding the trade . Which I will be updating every quarter every 3 months . Performance Initial investment June 2025 $ 15611.64 Current investment $ 18421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far Processing $ 10161 Below I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement . What Is Lifecycle Investing Lifecycle investing by Ayres and Nalebuff argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth including future earnings is much larger than their current savings . Since most young investors have little capital available for investment but decades of future earnings they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans . As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal you should gradually reduce risk . How to do this First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share . Use leverage through either margin leveraged ETFs or deepinthemoney LEAPs Reduce leverage over time shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bondsreal estate and cash as retirement nears . Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter . Essentially youre looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation 062025 With only $ 15000 in my Roth IRA I can ’ t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in 2 years at the 300 strike price . So instead I ’ ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150 . VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase . Unfortunately VTI doesn ’ t offer options that expire 2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close . Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50 % of the underlying cost roughly 50 % of the ETF ’ s trading price mirroring 2x leverage . Ideally when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro Emini futures then Eminis as from an cost standpoint they actually cost the least as outlined in the book . Also you get the additional benefit of them not_expiring at least in the same way options do . Plan Quarterly Recalculation Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share . Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s . 1 . Deleverage Schedule Ages 27–30 Maintain 2x leverage . Ages 30–40 Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase . Ages 4050 Transition to a 1x unleveraged total equity allocation . Ages 50–59.5 Begin incorporating bondsreal estate and cash shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches . Risk Management and Contingencies Time decay I ’ ll monitor the LEAP ’ s theta and if rollover costs or time decay become excessive consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage . Market extremes If the cyclically adjusted PE CAPE ratio spikes above historical thresholds I may temporarily deleverage to 1x1.5x rather than fully exit equities . Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time . I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence . Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors . Rebalancing frequency I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal . Summary I ’ m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28yearold . Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments . Over the next decade I ’ ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears . Theoretically speaking over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years . Extensive Summary I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free"

      "selftext": "Hi all, As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions. I currently make ~ 95k and live at home with parents, I don’t pay rent, but I do pay $1000/ month towards my car payment (took a loan from family, will be fully paid off in 8 months, after which I’ll have no “expenses” per se) Now regarding my investment journey, I’ll start of by saying all the research I’ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA, so I’ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO. I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago, contributing 10% with a 5% employer match. Now the above retirement savings which I won’t be able to touch until I’m older, but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well? Is that even possible without risk? I am willing to invest $1000 monthly, is it best to just invest all of it in ETF’s? Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF’s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I’m doing with my Roth IRA. I don’t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $800 towards an ETF and $200 towards company stocks be a smart move? Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account, my understanding is that the benefits of this are: no limit on how much you can invest yearly, and withdraw your contributions anytime tax /penalty free, is my understanding of this correct? Thank you for any answers and advice!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions . I currently make 95k and live at home with parents I don ’ t pay rent but I do pay $ 1000 month towards my car payment took a loan from family will be fully paid off in 8 months after which I ’ ll have no_ “ expenses ” per se Now regarding my investment journey I ’ ll start of by saying all the research I ’ ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA so I ’ ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO . I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago contributing 10 % with a 5 % employer match . Now the above retirement savings which I won ’ t be able to touch until I ’ m older but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well Is that even possible without risk I am willing to invest $ 1000 monthly is it best to just invest all of it in ETF ’ s Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF ’ s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I ’ m doing with my Roth IRA . I don ’ t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $ 800 towards an ETF and $ 200 towards company stocks be a smart move Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account my understanding is that the benefits of this are no_limit on how much you can invest yearly and withdraw your contributions anytime tax penalty free is my understanding of this correct Thank you for any answers and advice"

      "selftext": "in my opinion, a low ROE does not mean a weak business and a high ROE does not always mean a strong one. For example Im taking UCL case (uCloudlink). Their ROE 8.7%, not really impressive but their fundamentals looks very interesting. Their EPS grew 85% over the past year, net income expanded 60% in five years and the stock up to almost 50% in 12 months. According to these numbers, I can see that their growth is outpacing than what their ROE reflects. Recently, their price drop a bit but when we looking into a long term and as Benjamin Graham said: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine\". This shows that ROE didnt capture the full earnings of a stock.",

      "selftext_processed": "in my opinion a low ROE does not_mean a weak business and a high ROE does not_always mean a strong one . For example Im taking UCL case uCloudlink . Their ROE 8.7 % not_really impressive but their fundamentals looks very interesting . Their EPS grew 85 % over the past year net income expanded 60 % in five years and the stock up to almost 50 % in 12 months . According to these numbers I can see that their growth is outpacing than what their ROE reflects . Recently their price drop a bit but when we looking into a long term and as Benjamin Graham said In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine . This shows that ROE didnt capture the full earnings of a stock ."

      "title": "SEZL DD pt.2: BNPL, the most misunderstood industry",
      "selftext": "[My original DD for SEZL is here]( Previous post if you haven't seen it yet \\^, little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL: **BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now. It's not nearly as irresponsible or \"set to blow up\" as the general sentiment makes it out to be.** 1. Standard loan tenor of Sezzle's BNPL average 40-50 days, with AOVs being $100-250. 2. BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx. 2% versus Credit Cards at 10%. People use Sezzle for groceries, gas, and other essentials/semi-essentials. Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs. 3. Sezzle does NOT make money off of defaulting consumers! The long-term value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time. They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition - again, short-term pain for long term customer filtering. 4. Limits and product usage can be changed instantly, versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice. Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time. 5. CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzle's target base is already low-mid income; consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance. **6. Management from Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, Zip (BNPL providers) all noted no negative changes in repayment ability - Affirm CEO actually noted that govt. workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise.** 7. Points 1-6 point to the low-risk of these loans compared to CCs, Auto, Mortgages etc. due to the nature of their AOV + importance to the consumer. 8. The misconception that \"people will stop paying their BNPL loans first\". ZERO data to suggest this. Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario, along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs. People would much rather pay off the $100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever. 9. Sezzle offers optional credit-reporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour, along with their tier program. **What has overshadowed the share price as of late?** 1. Liquidity risk-off from high-beta stocks in recent weeks (late Oct-now) 2. Rising delinquency rates that were guided for, in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment & shaky macro news. Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2% to 3% in recent quarter, BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.5-2.75%, from original guide of 2.5-3%. 3. Compressed net margin from 28% Q2 to 23% Q3 - mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates, again, were guided for at start of the year. Should not be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product (subscriptions versus one-time use card). Expecting 25-27.5% stable net margin for 2026. There is SOME real concern here but not scary enough to lose conviction IMO. **Why I believe upside is 100% from here (6m+ hold)** 1. Re-shift to subscription mid Q3 netted +80,000 active subscribers. Assume minimum 120,000/Q add for the next 3-4 quarters: this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR, as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins. Their previous focus in Q1-3 was a lower margin, less sticky product which proved to not be as beneficial, hence the switch. Will be a $15M+ figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q1-2026. 1.5. Active consumers expected to grow @ 4-6% QoQ & payback period of 6-9 months on marketing spend (8M/quarter) will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters & beyond. 2. Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant \"fear\" classification. The fears are not completely unwarranted, but for the most part, blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space. This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour. 3. Continued penetration of consumer acquisition + general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users, and consequently revenue. 4. Trading at 14 NTM P/E growing at 60% YoY revenue & Net Income. History of earnings double beat. 5. Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged - management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentiment/repayment ability is low. Anticipating this to be closer to 4.5-5. 6. As bad as it may sound, their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials - cutting this service out of the user's life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it. End of the day, no different from a Credit Card. 7. Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners. *Conclusion: QE begins, market sentiment changes to \"BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears\", company performance will continue to deliver, and multiple expansion will persist to re-rate the company closer to 20-25x NTM P/E.* BASE case: assuming 20-25x NTM P/E: EPS 5.5 NTM @ May 2026: SP of $110-137.50. BULL case (short/gamma squeeze, unlikely, but happened May 2025): 35-40x NTM P/E, $200+ possible. UNLIKELY by EOY2026. **Positions have rotated into 800 shares. Options IV is way too high @ 90%.**",

      "selftext_processed": "My original DD for SEZL is here Previous post if you havent seen it yet little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now . Its not_nearly as irresponsible or set to blow up as the general sentiment makes it out to be . 1 . Standard loan tenor of Sezzles BNPL average 4050 days with AOVs being $ 100250 . 2 . BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx . 2 % versus Credit Cards at 10 % . People use Sezzle for groceries gas and other essentialssemiessentials . Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs . 3 . Sezzle does NOT_make money off of defaulting consumers The longterm value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time . They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition again shortterm pain for long term customer filtering . 4 . Limits and product usage can be changed instantly versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice . Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time . 5 . CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzles target base is already lowmid income consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance . 6 . Management from Affirm Klarna Sezzle Zip BNPL providers all noted no_negative changes in repayment ability Affirm CEO actually noted that govt . workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise . 7 . Points 16 point to the lowrisk of these loans compared to CCs Auto Mortgages etc . due to the nature of their AOV importance to the consumer . 8 . The misconception that people will stop paying their BNPL loans first . ZERO data to suggest this . Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs . People would much rather pay off the $ 100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever . 9 . Sezzle offers optional creditreporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour along with their tier program . What has overshadowed the share price as of late 1 . Liquidity riskoff from highbeta stocks in recent weeks late Octnow 2 . Rising delinquency rates that were guided for in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment shaky macro news . Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2 % to 3 % in recent quarter BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.52.75 % from original guide of 2.53 % . 3 . Compressed net margin from 28 % Q2 to 23 % Q3 mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates again were guided for at start of the year . Should not_be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product subscriptions versus onetime use card . Expecting 2527.5 % stable net margin for 2026 . There is SOME real concern here but not_scary enough to lose conviction IMO . Why I believe upside is 100 % from here 6m hold 1 . Reshift to subscription mid Q3 netted 80000 active subscribers . Assume minimum 120000Q add for the next 34 quarters this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins . Their previous focus in Q13 was a lower margin less sticky product which proved to not_be as beneficial hence the switch . Will be a $ 15M figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q12026 . 1.5 . Active consumers expected to grow 46 % QoQ payback period of 69 months on marketing spend 8Mquarter will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters beyond . 2 . Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant fear classification . The fears are not_completely unwarranted but for the most part blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space . This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour . 3 . Continued penetration of consumer acquisition general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users and consequently revenue . 4 . Trading at 14 NTM PE growing at 60 % YoY revenue Net Income . History of earnings double beat . 5 . Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentimentrepayment ability is low . Anticipating this to be closer to 4.55 . 6 . As bad as it may sound their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials cutting this service out of the users life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it . End of the day no_different from a Credit Card . 7 . Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners . Conclusion QE begins market sentiment changes to BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears company performance will continue to deliver and multiple expansion will persist to rerate the company closer to 2025x NTM PE .

Unless it's critical, I'll not say who I'm investing through just yet. One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they cannot change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago. I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments. If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases, I'm going to have a massive tax load. If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases, I may actually be showing a loss. This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest, like next year when I'll be retired and have no salary income to report for the year.",

One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they can not change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago . I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments . If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases Im going to have a massive tax load . If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases I may actually be showing a loss . This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest like next year when Ill be retired and have no_salary income to report for the year ."

      "selftext": "Apple’s head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, will step down from his position, the company announced on Monday. The move is the most visible shakeup in Apple’s artificial intelligence group since the company announced Apple Intelligence, its AI software suite, in 2024. Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026. Giannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile. Subramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring. In a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive. “In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said. Source: [",

In 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago]( I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M. [Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains]( That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios: [I \\(blue\\) am +263&#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&#37; over that time period]( The account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided. Summary: \\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin. \\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.** [Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options]( Q&A 1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?* \\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this? 2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?* \\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017. *3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?* \\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

In 6 months the account grew another $ 470K so Im at $ 1.5M of total gains since my first post 5 and a half years ago I did withdraw $ 250K to buy a new home so the account sits at $ 2.3M . Ending Net Deposits $ 1.5M in gains Thats a 27 % compound return a year for nearly 6 years . I continue to crush regular rstock boomer index fund portfolios I blue am 26337 while stocks green are barely 10037 over that time period The account has $ 7.3M assets and $ 5M borrowed in options so thats 3.2x leverage . Im underleveraged I know . The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $ 2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage . I havent decided . Summary Borrow 24x the value of your account on margin . Dump it all in a multiasset diversified portfolio . For the stock sleeve I prefer smartbeta funds due to their higher expected returns . The goal is maximum compound returns . Positions Stocks bonds mutual funds and $ 5M borrowed in Box Spread Options QA 1 When will you deleverpayoff the debtliquidate Never_This maximizes returns . Why do anything but this 2 Whats it like for your account to grow $ 1M per year Its cool you should try it . Save what you can invest it like this and give it time . I started with just $ 20K in 2017 . 3 Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere I have every penny riding in here . Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27 % per year so why do that"

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "selftext": "“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders. Burry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market. He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution. Burry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards. Tesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

      "selftext_processed": "“ Big Short ” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter calling the electricvehicle maker “ ridiculously overvalued ” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern . Burry argued that Tesla ’ s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no_buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders . Burry cited Tesla ’ s SEC filings showing that the company ’ s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7 % over the past several years driven primarily by stockbased compensation and past equity raises . Tesla ’ s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a splitadjusted basis following the company ’ s 5for1 stock split in 2020 and 3for1 split in 2022 both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market . He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period including two $ 5 billion atthemarket ATM raises in September and December 2020 followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $ 12 billion in new equity issuance . These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company ’ s float and remain a key driver of longterm dilution . Burry also referenced Tesla ’ s most recent quarterly filings which reported over $ 1.7 billion in stockbased compensation SBC expense yeartodate resulting in a continual increase in the weightedaverage share count used for earnings calculations . Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure including multiyear performancebased awards . Tesla has no_active sharebuyback program and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained freecashflow levels . Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equitylinked programs ."

      "title": "A Closer Look At What Nvidia’s Numbers Might Be Suggesting",
      "selftext": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again, and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about. The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not look isolated at all. A 1% to 1.8% decline might seem manageable, but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time, it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals. The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this. Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback, I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup. Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high. Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising. That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me. What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt. Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia’s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path. If that is true, how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia’s long term revenue structure? Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue? Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory. They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320. A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious. Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia’s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle. The insider activity adds another layer entirely. Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day, totaling 9924868, with an average value of about 661657 each. The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern. The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher. It does not necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions. She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not a withdrawal of confidence, but it is a moment that makes you look twice. Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys. Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem. It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype. So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another. A stock sliding with its sector. A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not explosive. Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets. Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that cannot just be ignored. And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing. The question I keep coming back to is simple. Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more. I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about . The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not_look isolated at all . A 1 % to 1.8 % decline might seem manageable but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals . The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this . Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup . Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no_trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high . Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising . That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me . What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt . Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia ’ s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path . If that is true how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia ’ s long term revenue structure Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory . They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320 . A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious . Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia ’ s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle . The insider activity adds another layer entirely . Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day totaling 9924868 with an average value of about 661657 each . The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern . The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher . It does not_necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions . She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not_a withdrawal of confidence but it is a moment that makes you look twice . Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys . Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem . It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype . So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another . A stock sliding with its sector . A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not_explosive . Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets . Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that can not just be ignored . And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing . The question I keep coming back to is simple . Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more . I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next ."

And while OpenAI needs you to sign up for ChatGPT Plus, Google can just push Gemini into every Android device, Gmail, Docs, all the apps billions of people already use without thinking about it. It’s kind of sneaky but genius. Plus they have YouTube, Maps, Search… the amount of data they can train on is ridiculous. It’s hard to compete with that.

      "selftext": "Rough close today Dow down almost 1%, S&P and Nasdaq red too. Felt like the whole market just dragged its feet all day. What caught my eye though was BABA actually showing some life for once, up more than 4%. I haven t seen that stock stretch its legs in a while. Meanwhile AVGO took a hit, and NVDA/AAPL bounced a bit, which honestly feels like the usual “tech rotation but not really” type of day. I don t have a big China position right now, but moves like this always make me wonder if these little green sparks are just noise or the early signs of something shifting. Hard to tell with how moody the market s been. Anyone else watching BABA or is this just another one day head fake? Curious how you all are positioning with this weird mix of red indices random pockets of strength.",

What caught my eye though was BABA actually showing some life for once up more than 4 % . I haven t seen that stock stretch its legs in a while . Meanwhile AVGO took a hit and NVDAAAPL bounced a bit which honestly feels like the usual “ tech rotation but not_really ” type of day . I don t have a big China position right now but moves like this always make me wonder if these little green sparks are just noise or the early signs of something shifting . Hard to tell with how moody the market s been . Anyone else watching BABA or is this just another one day head fake Curious how you all are positioning with this weird mix of red indices random pockets of strength ."

      "selftext": "🚨🚨 BARRICK MINING (GOLD CHAD OF THE CENTURY) DD 🚨🚨 aka: Why $GOLD is about to melt faces harder than a 1999 dot-com chart but with ACTUAL PROFITS Listen up you smooth-brained degenerates who think “diversification” means buying calls AND puts on the same ticker. I bring you THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The One True DD. The post that will make your future grandchildren ask, “Grandpa, how did you become disgustingly wealthy?” And you’ll just whisper… “Barrick, my child.” ⸻ 💰 THE SETUP: BARRICK IS PRIMED TO GO GOD MODE Here’s what’s cooking hotter than Mali during the wet season: 1️⃣ S&P500 Inclusion → +$10 share price Index funds will have to buy this like a boomer panic-buying toilet paper in 2020. Guaranteed forced buying = tendies. 2️⃣ Analyst Price Targets Averaging $46 Wall Street FINALLY woke up from their coke-coma and realized Barrick isn’t some penny stock miner digging with spoons. 3️⃣ FOURMILE MINE = THE NEVADA GIGACHAD • Literally the #1 best mine discovery of our generation • Doesn’t require double fraction processing like the other peasant mines • Single fraction extraction = lower cost = higher profit = more stonk go up This thing prints gold like a stimmy printer in 2020. 4️⃣ Mali Resolution → +$10 share price No more geopolitical headache. Add another $10 because peace = profits. 5️⃣ Production Increasing 6% Every Year Imagine a miner that actually grows instead of declining like your OTM calls. Wild. ⸻ 🪙 THE GOLD MATH (YES, I DID MATH. YOU’RE WELCOME.) At different gold prices, Barrick is basically a cheat code: • $55 share price @ $3300 gold • $65 @ $3700 • Bank of America says $4000 gold by end of 2025 • $75 @ $4000 • $85 @ $4300 • $95 @ $4600 • $110 @ $5000 Gold going up? Barrick prints money. Gold going sideways? Barrick prints money. Gold going down? Barrick STILL prints money because Fourmile is basically a money-spitting dragon. ⸻ 📈 NOW THE JUICY PART Starting valuation: $55/share at $4000 gold Every +100 in gold price = +$3.5/share Current gold price in your note? $4200 gold. That means: • $55 base • +$10 from Mali • +$7 from the gold price difference 🔥 = $72/share conservative value right now 🔥 Market currently pricing Barrick like it’s a grandma with a metal detector, not a global gold emperor with the best mine in Nevada. ⸻ 🚀 TL;DR FOR THE ADHD AUTISTS • S&P inclusion = forced buying • Fourmile mine = god-tier print factory • Mali drama resolved • Analysts already behind the curve • Gold trending up • Barrick undervalued harder than Bitcoin at $200 Target: $72 short-term. $110+ if gold hits $5k. ⸻ 🦍💎 FINAL THOUGHTS 💎🦍 This isn’t a meme stock. This is the anti-meme stock. This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman. This is free money with a shovel. The WSB play isn’t to YOLO weeklies — it’s to buy, hold, and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion. GOLD TO THE MOON. BARRICK TO VALHALLA. I am not a financial advisor. I am, however, extremely bullish and slightly intoxicated. Positions Below ya regards, screenshot for proof 35C january 2027 40C january 2027",

      "selftext": "Lately I've been looking at Bitcoin after the recent 30% drop and considering it as a potential place to start building a position. I've got around 10k set aside for investing and I'm still pretty new to the whole process, so I've been trying to get a better sense of how different assets behave during pullbacks. Bitcoin in particular has caught my attention. I've been comparing a couple of charts that seem to give completely different signals-one points toward a possible end of the sell-off, while the other looks like there's still room for more downside. It's been interesting trying to make sense of how conflicting indicators can coexist and what that says about market sentiment overall. Just putting my thoughts together as I watch how things develop and try to understand the bigger picture around BTC and the current market environment Charts",

Ive got around 10k set aside for investing and Im still pretty new to the whole process so Ive been trying to get a better sense of how different assets behave during pullbacks . Bitcoin in particular has caught my attention . Ive been comparing a couple of charts that seem to give completely different signalsone points toward a possible end of the selloff while the other looks like theres still room for more downside . Its been interesting trying to make sense of how conflicting indicators can coexist and what that says about market sentiment overall . Just putting my thoughts together as I watch how things develop and try to understand the bigger picture around BTC and the current market environment Charts"

      "selftext": "# RGTI Insiders still selling Latest sells were on 21-Nov by CFO and CTO. CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $12/share [openinsider]( And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue, what are insiders doing? Still selling. The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company. Zero. Some people defend this by saying he has stock options, but that is not the same as owning the stock. For a company this young and unproven, a leader should have skin in the game. The people running this company are cashing out, not buying in. The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits. # $1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $12-$15 range is the right play, and the latest 10-Q report proves my point. I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025, and the business is actually getting worse. Their revenue for the last nine months was only $5.2 million. That is a massive drop from the $8.5 million they made in the same period last year. A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag. So how are they staying alive? By printing a ridiculous number of new shares. They burned through over $41 million in cash in just nine months. To cover that, they sold nearly $347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering. They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself cannot generate enough cash. This is not a sign of a healthy company; it is a sign of continuing desperation. # Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Here's RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025: [ ..and Mckinsey & Co.: position 250 RGTZ - (inverse w/ 2x leverage)",

      "selftext": "Everytime the yield curve inverts, we get a lot of youtube videos where they fear monger using this fact. When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens, that's when historically, recessions have happened. The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break, and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession. This time however, the yield curve has come out of inversion (barely) and will either go up, or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up (in which case they say that the recession is assured). Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85% I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat, maybe there won't be a recession. Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession. At this point in time, based on the data we have, what do you think is most likely to happen (regarding the rate cuts, unemployment numbers, and the likelihood of a recession)?",

When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens thats when historically recessions have happened . The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession . This time however the yield curve has come out of inversion barely and will either go up or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up in which case they say that the recession is assured . Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85 % I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat maybe there wont be a recession . Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession . At this point in time based on the data we have what do you think is most likely to happen regarding the rate cuts unemployment numbers and the likelihood of a recession"

Additionally: CRCL and NVO are currently undervalued at their current prices and warrant investment. Their long-term recovery is merely a matter of time.

My current breakdown looks like this: HYSA: ~$20k saved ($2,650 average monthly cost, 6 month safety accrued) - Saving around $700 per month 401(k): ~$21k invested (investing 4.5% with 100% company match at 4.5%) - Aggressive portfolio type, large cap markets and some mid cap markets only ROTH: ~$17k invested (try to put $540 in monthly, split between 90% S&P, 10% international) Personal Investments: ~$4k invested (mostly S&P with a handful of other stocks) - Investments are sporadic, thinking of cutting half of my savings moving forward and investing (e.g. $350 into HYSA, $350 into personal investments) - Also thinking of taking any interest earned on my HYSA, and putting into personal investments Let me know if there’s anything more I can do! Living in a HCOL city makes things a bit trickier, but want to try to streamline my investment process as much as possible!",

      "selftext": "I am writing this on my phone. So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes. What IOVA does? Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors. (Roughly over 90%, remaining 10% being Blood) Their product, Amtagvi (lifileucel), is a one-time TIL therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Doctors take T cells from the tumor, Iovance expands them into billions, and those cells get infused back into the patient. Very intuitive, essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer. Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real, durable responses. This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers. Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works. I hold 30,000 shares. 2) Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths. You may have heard of CAR-T but that doesn’t work on them. They only work for blood cancer which is only 10% of TAM, rest being Soldin tumor cancer. Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment, and 2L severely lacking treatment. If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers, the market is massive. Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD. Add cervical, NSCLC, head and neck, ovarian: the upside gets wide quickly. In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications, with several already in late stage phase 3. The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat. And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area. With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment. NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space. No other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is. They have their own manufacturing facilities that’s worth 1 billion USD itself. 3) Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid-2024. Early numbers: • Q2: around $31M • Q3: around $62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter. 70+ treatment centers active or onboarding. Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250-300M range. And management has reiterated their range for EOY. For a ~$1B market cap company, that’s extremely low valuation. 3) Bear Case arguments that don’t hold water Execution: With IOVA bears and shorts never questioned the science but about the execution. I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible. However, they bought in a new CFO (Corleen Roche) in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40% in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption: This was another pain point, during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA. Since, it is a Novel treatment. Patient referrals by Doctors was slow, and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process. In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson (The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies). The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff. Q4 will be explosive. Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write: 1. Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast. If they keep beating, the market re-rates this quickly. Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target. Q4 will be huge for this stock 2. New indications Cervical cancer filing potential. NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval First-line melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3. 3. Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway. (UK is already approved but not announced) Canada already approved. 4. Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time = more patients = more revenue. 5. Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable, any major pharma would want this platform. 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy Long-Term Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors, this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers. The total addressable market becomes enormous. At least $30B and at current share prices that’s $75 per share. Even if you are super bear about this stock at $10 minimum is already better than its current price. Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock. First-in-class advantage, strong early sales, a huge melanoma market, and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers. If they execute, this isn’t a 5 percent upside story. It’s potentially several multiples. This is why I’m long 30K shares. Risks Not sugarcoated: • Manufacturing is complex. • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong. Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail. But highly unlikely given its recent data release. It’s incredible • Volatility is brutal. Shorts have been at this stock with about 35% shorted. However, about 80-90% is owned by Institutions. Big names like Blackrock, GS , etc.. • They’ve diluted before and might again if sales don’t scale fast enough. But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don’t buy this thinking it’s a safe biotech. You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks. And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy, real revenue, growing adoption, a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers, and a valuation priced like it’s dead. I’m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science, the market, and the timing actually line up. If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts, this has legitimate multi-bagger potential. Q4 will be turning point. Get in before the stock rips. It will create generational wealth. If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn’t complete vapor, this is one of the few worth watching.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am writing this on my phone . So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes . What IOVA does Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors . Roughly over 90 % remaining 10 % being Blood Their product Amtagvi lifileucel is a onetime TIL therapy tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes . Doctors take T cells from the tumor Iovance expands them into billions and those cells get infused back into the patient . Very intuitive essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer . Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real durable responses . This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers . Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works . I hold 30000 shares . 2 Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths . You may have heard of CART but that doesn ’ t work on them . They only work for blood cancer which is only 10 % of TAM rest being Soldin tumor cancer . Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment and 2L severely lacking treatment . If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers the market is massive . Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD . Add cervical NSCLC head and neck ovarian the upside gets wide quickly . In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications with several already in late stage phase 3 . The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat . And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area . With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment . NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space . No_other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is . They have their own manufacturing facilities that ’ s worth 1 billion USD itself . 3 Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid2024 . Early numbers • Q2 around $ 31M • Q3 around $ 62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter . 70 treatment centers active or onboarding . Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250300M range . And management has reiterated their range for EOY . For a $ 1B market cap company that ’ s extremely low valuation . 3 Bear Case arguments that don ’ t hold water Execution With IOVA bears and shorts never_questioned the science but about the execution . I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible . However they bought in a new CFO Corleen Roche in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40 % in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption This was another pain point during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA . Since it is a Novel treatment . Patient referrals by Doctors was slow and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process . In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies . The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff . Q4 will be explosive . Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write 1 . Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast . If they keep beating the market rerates this quickly . Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target . Q4 will be huge for this stock 2 . New indications Cervical cancer filing potential . NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval Firstline melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3 . 3 . Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway . UK is already approved but not_announced Canada already approved . 4 . Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time more patients more revenue . 5 . Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable any major pharma would want this platform . 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy LongTerm Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers . The total addressable market becomes enormous . At least $ 30B and at current share prices that ’ s $ 75 per share . Even if you are super bear about this stock at $ 10 minimum is already better than its current price . Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock . Firstinclass advantage strong early sales a huge melanoma market and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers . If they execute this isn ’ t a 5 percent upside story . It ’ s potentially several multiples . This is why I ’ m long 30K shares . Risks Not_sugarcoated • Manufacturing is complex . • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong . Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail . But highly unlikely given its recent data release . It ’ s incredible • Volatility is brutal . Shorts have been at this stock with about 35 % shorted . However about 8090 % is owned by Institutions . Big names like Blackrock GS etc .. • They ’ ve diluted before and might again if sales don ’ t scale fast enough . But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don ’ t buy this thinking it ’ s a safe biotech . You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks . And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy real revenue growing adoption a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers and a valuation priced like it ’ s dead . I ’ m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science the market and the timing actually line up . If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts this has legitimate multibagger potential . Q4 will be turning point . Get in before the stock rips . It will create generational wealth . If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn ’ t complete vapor this is one of the few worth watching ."

      "title": "Why Some Commercial Biotech Companies Get Valued on Trailing Revenue Instead of Forward Expectations",
      "selftext": "Over the past year I’ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercial-stage biotech companies. Unlike most sectors, which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue, early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter. This creates situations where companies with FDA approval, real product sales, and multi-year cash runways still get priced as if nothing meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two. One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer’s drug called Zunveyl into long-term care earlier this year. They reported a little over $2.6 million in product revenue last quarter, and early adoption from facilities has been steady, but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering, solid QoQ growth. It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech. Is this caution justified, or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase? [](",

It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I, 20M, invest 2,500 dollars a month. I do an on/off split where one month I do the full 2,500 into my stocks/ETfs, and the next month I’ll do 2,100 into stocks/ETFs, but 400 into crypto (only BTC and ETH, 200 dollars each) As we’ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately (BTC is well below 90k at the moment) and it leads me questioning, should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do? Or just put my money straight into my stocks/ETS, and don’t do crypto? I mainly see crypto as a gamble. Not as an investment, I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype, I’m not really sure what my money is even going into. Any, and all advice is welcome! I plan to be in the market for a very very long time. Thank you for taking time to read this and reply :)",

I do an onoff split where one month I do the full 2500 into my stocksETfs and the next month I ’ ll do 2100 into stocksETFs but 400 into crypto only BTC and ETH 200 dollars each As we ’ ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately BTC is well below 90k at the moment and it leads me questioning should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do Or just put my money straight into my stocksETS and don ’ t do crypto I mainly see crypto as a gamble . Not_as an investment I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype I ’ m not_really sure what my money is even going into . Any and all advice is welcome I plan to be in the market for a very very long time . Thank you for taking time to read this and reply"

Emotional overthinking: overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades. I’m genuinely curious, which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friends/family fall for?

      "selftext": "Note: \"Weak consumer spending\" refers to store expectations before the season started. Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No paywall: [ >Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season. Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza. >As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade. >Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012. >The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024. >Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. >Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.) >“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.” >Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said. >The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior. >Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year. >A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.” >Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found. >Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide? >The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending. >Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring. >“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Weak consumer spending refers to store expectations before the season started . Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No_paywall Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season . Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza . As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade . Challenger Gray Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012 . The National Retail Federation a trade group also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season plans to bring on extra staff could be at “ the lowest level in more than 15 years. ” Retailers were expected to bring on 265000 to 365000 seasonal workers compared to 442000 in 2024 . Interest in seasonal work though remains plenty high — up 27 % at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board according to Cory Stahle a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab . Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7 % from a year ago and still below prepandemic levels . Indeed ’ s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall such as in accounting and ski resorts rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail Stahle said . “ I think it ’ s very telling that we ’ re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago ” Stahle said . “ There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall. ” Retail especially has “ just really pulled back ” he said . The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119000 positions that month though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts . The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare food services and drinking places and social assistance and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior . Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans . Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year . A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach saying “ For the past few years we ’ ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates . It ’ s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive. ” Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a Kshaped economy . A recent survey of 1048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America ’ s Future found that 68 % of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year while 59 % anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year . Just 5 % of respondents were actively hiring or expanding while 16 % were scaling back the survey found . Read more What is a Kshaped economy and whats causing the divide The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending . Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring . “ Employers aren ’ t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through or to the degree in which people are going to spend and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing ” Stahle said ."

I’ve run several iterations over the past few weeks and I think this version is close to finalized. The goal is to capture long term upside from large cap AI leaders while balancing that exposure with broad market, growth, and large-cap ETFs. Essentially: high conviction + diversified stability. I’m open to suggestions. Current Allocation Proposal: 25% FSKAX – Total U.S. market exposure (small/mid caps, defensives, full sector diversification) 15% FSPGX – Large cap growth tilt without overly concentrating the portfolio 10% VUG – Additional high growth exposure with a low cost mega-cap focus 15% MSFT – Core AI & cloud leader 12% GOOG – Strong AI, ads, and cloud positioning; still attractively valued 12% META – Massive FCF with accelerating AI and social monetization 8% NVDA – AI infrastructure leader (kept at a disciplined weight for volatility control) 3% CRWD – cybersecurity growth kicker The intention is to build something that behaves like a high-yield savings engine over 5–10 years strong compounding, manageable volatility, and diversified enough to preserve capital for future opportunities (real estate, business acquisition, etc.).

After losing some money by following trends and not knowing what i was doing, i was financially down a bit with some of my first investments as a person now in my 20s. But the past 2 weeks Ive been greening just about everyday. I know how to time when i stock shoots up, i know when to sell now. I know what to look for. I just really need payoff. I'm tired of seeing other people get their payday. I want to know my intuition will turn into something. I want this week to be one i remember. I know it’s about balance and not letting my emotions get in the way. Edit: Do not harass me and insult me for my posts about investing. It is my interest and it’s a public forum. If I am on topic there is no reason for these targets on my character. I have done nothing wrong but post about overcoming my losses with solid profit and trusting my own abilities.",

      "selftext": "Hey folks, Relatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \\~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \\~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. Profile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\\~30k) looks something like this: ETFs: \\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN) \\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6) \\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) Stocks: \\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML \\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech & Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays. \\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close. Before you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. Eventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. Can you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives? I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons. Lastly, I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO, QQQ and others. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey folks Relatively new investor here just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security . I have a pretty high risk tolerance for 50 % of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and 50 % in long term 20 year ETFs as retirement fund . Profile 33M single no_kids western Europe low mortgage low expenses have a 3 month safety net monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 500 per month with the following portfolio goal note my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs . My current portfolio 30k looks something like this ETFs 30 % Amundi Prime AllWorld WEBN 10 % Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc LYP6 5 % WisdomTree Europe Defence EUDF Stocks 30 % across 10 medium term high conviction TechAI GOOGL MSFT NVDA META AMD AVGO NBIS SOFI ASML 20 % across 20 or so shortmedium term low conviction Tech Other stocks I won´t list them but everything from AMZ VRT IREN TSMC MU BABA RKLB ASTS and some utilities raw materials etc generally speculative plays . 5 % I consider noise learning experiences minor investments of 5 50 eur which I´ll gradually close . Before you all jump down my throat I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated . Given my risk profile I am happy to keep 30 40 % of portfolio within the growthtech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble . I am also happy to keep 10 % in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so . For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments . Eventually as I get older and want more security I will aim for 6070 % ETFs maybe some other assets like goldreal estatebonds etc so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant . I´m considering adding something like FTSE AllWorld High Dividend Yield Acc VHYG or an Emerging MarketsexUS fund . I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns sector rotations crashes . I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable defensive consumerutility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions . I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s hightech or highUS given the above allocation . Can you give me your thoughts on this Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more Should I stick to WEBN LYP6 or any better alternatives I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies and want to allocate accordingly e.g . I do not_want to invest in PLTR APPL TSLA for reasons . Lastly I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO QQQ and others . Thanks"

My question is this: am I the only relatively young and knowledgeable person investing in a Golden Butterfly portfolio? Everyone my age that I see on Reddit always seems to have a much higher percentage of stocks. Are people really that long-term oriented and that indifferent to short-term drops?

      "title": "Intel and Potential Apple Chip Manufacturing Partnership",
      "selftext": "Intel shares jumped as much as 10% on Friday, marking the stock's fifth consecutive session of gains, after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is on track to have Intel manufacture its lowest-end M-series chips using the 18A process as early as mid-2027. The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly. Intel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.",

      "selftext_processed": "Intel shares jumped as much as 10 % on Friday marking the stocks fifth consecutive session of gains after analyst MingChi Kuo reported that Apple is on track to have Intel manufacture its lowestend Mseries chips using the 18A process as early as mid2027 . The potential deal would involve production of approximately 1520 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices representing a cautious diversification of Apples supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company . The rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC including reports of a raid on an Intel executives home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology . Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer which analysts described as having improved significantly . Intel led chip stocks higher on Friday helping drive the broader SP 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November . The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume with options activity notably elevated . The potential Apple partnership while modest in scale compared to TSMCs highend chip production for Apple would mark a significant validation of Intels foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process ."

      "selftext": "I always read tha WLI is a terrible investment, maybe it is for most people, but I'm wondering if it really is for those with high income and a decent amount of money invested already. Assume you make enough money to max out your 401k, HSA, and already have large amounts in stocks, real estate, and other alternative asset classes like crypto or gold. EDIT: you are not comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already. With an IRR of 3.5% over 30 years that you can access through tax-free loans (loan interest is covered by cash value interests), wouldn't WLI yield decent returns for retirement? Consider that at a tax rate of 40%, a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8% in IRR for the same after-tax money. EDIT: HYSA's yield about 3.5% pre-tax. EDIT: please don't simply reply \"yes\" or \"no\" without justification, this thread is not meant to be a vote FINAL EDIT & CONCLUSION: From y'all's comments, my take-away is that a WLI is complex and requires to sustain a high income/savings over 10+ years to start to see the advantages. As far as I'm concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bonds-like return-risk profile. In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its tax-deferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value. It also gives optionality for estate planning. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have a solid, sustainable cash flow already (for instance already maxing out all tax-advantaged accounts). Thanks all !",

Not by lying, but by moving normal revenue into the AI bucket and pushing a lot of the costs somewhere else. The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives. That never lasts forever and it usually makes the early margins look stronger than they really are. It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth, but the real costs showed up a few quarters later. I’m trying to figure out how much of the current AI excitement is real demand and how much is just accounting.",

Not_by lying but by moving normal revenue into the AI bucket and pushing a lot of the costs somewhere else . The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives . That never_lasts forever and it usually makes the early margins look stronger than they really are . It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth but the real costs showed up a few quarters later . I ’ m trying to figure out how much of the current AI excitement is real demand and how much is just accounting ."

      "selftext": "Hey folks- happy Thanksgiving! Semi-analysis ( leading research lab in semiconductors and Ai) have just published a report on the hot topic. $GOOGL TpU vs $Nvida GpU. They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it! - Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips. - This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no longer the only monopoly for Ai chips. - Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap! At the 9k standard rack size, Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu. - what does this mean for GPU users? Google tpu will crush with margins. They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable. - nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60% in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market. - OpenAi is in huge trouble. They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU. But the price difference means they will see bad/negative margins for a while. Almost 1/2 trillion in losses for the next 5 years. Compute is expensive & seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU. - NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting. Initial trials to see how market response is. Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $GOOGL is $META & Xai. Both who are huge nvida customers! This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this. I am in a pair trade with long $GOOGL shares + $AVGO calls and short on $NVDA/$AMD. It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models, Google cloud ☁️ dominance over Aws/AZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida.

      "selftext": "The foundation of the global financial system, Japan, is beginning to shift. For more than three decades, global asset prices including US Treasuries, technology stocks, and real estate have quietly depended on Japan’s ultra-low interest rate policy. This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade, where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higher-yielding global assets. The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades. In November 2025, that logic began to collapse. Yields on long-term Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades, with 20-year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40-year bonds nearing 3.7 percent. This is not a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression. The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability. As Japanese yields rise, funding costs climb worldwide, currency volatility spreads, and the unwinding of long-standing carry trades begins. Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in, tightening liquidity across global markets. The implications extend far beyond Japan. The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries, which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system. A stronger yen can pressure the dollar, forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets. What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system. Crypto markets, being the most liquidity-sensitive segment of global finance, are already showing signs of strain. As liquidity dries up, volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous. Traders are forced to adjust strategies, often moving from high-risk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans. In many ways, crypto acts as a real-time indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift. As global liquidity tightens, crypto’s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible. On one hand, its price action mirrors broader risk-off cycles as capital flees leverage. On the other, decentralized markets continue to function around the clock, offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress. Stablecoin redemptions, exchange outflows, and on-chain volume spikes serve as real-time indicators of changing sentiment. Meanwhile, traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility, shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions. In this new environment, the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not just as speculation but as infrastructure, a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance. But this environment also exposes another weakness, the fragility of market infrastructure. During periods of sharp volatility, execution delays, failed orders, and platform outages become common. In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often, reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment. Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed, security, and verifiable reserves, building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not. The world long assumed Japan would stay still. But now it is moving, and the ripple effect has only just begun. edit: Really appreciate all the insights in the comments, especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground. I didn’t expect this topic to spark so much discussion, but it’s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes. After reading through everyone’s replies, I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week’s swings. Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded. Out of curiosity, I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here, and to my surprise, execution was much smoother. Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves. It might not be the biggest name, but when markets go crazy, that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "The foundation of the global financial system Japan is beginning to shift . For more than three decades global asset prices including US Treasuries technology stocks and real estate have quietly depended on Japan ’ s ultralow interest rate policy . This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higheryielding global assets . The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades . In November 2025 that logic began to collapse . Yields on longterm Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades with 20year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40year bonds nearing 3.7 percent . This is not_a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression . The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability . As Japanese yields rise funding costs climb worldwide currency volatility spreads and the unwinding of longstanding carry trades begins . Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in tightening liquidity across global markets . The implications extend far beyond Japan . The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system . A stronger yen can pressure the dollar forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets . What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system . Crypto markets being the most liquiditysensitive segment of global finance are already showing signs of strain . As liquidity dries up volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous . Traders are forced to adjust strategies often moving from highrisk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans . In many ways crypto acts as a realtime indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift . As global liquidity tightens crypto ’ s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible . On one hand its price action mirrors broader riskoff cycles as capital flees leverage . On the other decentralized markets continue to function around the clock offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress . Stablecoin redemptions exchange outflows and onchain volume spikes serve as realtime indicators of changing sentiment . Meanwhile traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions . In this new environment the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not_just as speculation but as infrastructure a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance . But this environment also exposes another weakness the fragility of market infrastructure . During periods of sharp volatility execution delays failed orders and platform outages become common . In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment . Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed security and verifiable reserves building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not_The world long assumed Japan would stay still . But now it is moving and the ripple effect has only just begun . edit Really appreciate all the insights in the comments especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground . I didn ’ t expect this topic to spark so much discussion but it ’ s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes . After reading through everyone ’ s replies I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week ’ s swings . Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded . Out of curiosity I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here and to my surprise execution was much smoother . Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves . It might not_be the biggest name but when markets go crazy that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else ."

He claims that high-quality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity. He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source. The entry point seems accessible, starting from a couple thousand dollars, but to acquire something truly noteworthy, the investment would likely be in the range of $50,000 to $200,000. Has anyone had experience with this asset class? What are your thoughts on its potential and risks? Also, if you're knowledgeable, could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market?",

He claims that highquality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity . He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source . The entry point seems accessible starting from a couple thousand dollars but to acquire something truly noteworthy the investment would likely be in the range of $ 50000 to $ 200000 . Has anyone had experience with this asset class What are your thoughts on its potential and risks Also if youre knowledgeable could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market"

No_SP futures no_crude no_bonds… nothing_Just silence . Look I ’ m not_saying AI is to blame… …but data centers have been running hotter than my margin calls ever since everyone started training 900 billion–parameter models to recommend cat memes . We ’ ve officially reached the point where AI is physically melting the financial system . At this rate Nvidia will cause the next recession just by turning on another cluster .
