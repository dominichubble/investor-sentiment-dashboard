      "selftext": "For a lot of people, they just dont see the markets as fair. They are coming into a system that has been running for quite some time, and the systems are not really allowing/ forgiven of completely new players. Im not trolling here, so please be nice. I've thought about this a lot, and I really dont understand why resets are a problem if done correctly. A lot of people think resetting the markets would be a huge problem, or they just dont want to have to work again, but that wouldn't really be the issue. If the market reset was a force yearly sale, everyone would be ready to play the game again next year . You place your bets every year like you are doing now . Everyone's hoarding gains are holding out for tomorrow when the money is always designed to be spent immediately or close to it. If you had a portfolio worth 1m, you would have 1m again at the reset . All the stocks go to their ipo prices, and the bidding wars begin. If the us markets are locked behind us people I dont see how we all cant collectively run the markets this way if the markets are truly indications of success from the business your holding that success should be re evaluated each year. We dont need a crystal ball to see 10 years into the future. Just worry about the year and then do your d d for the next year . You still get to sit on your ass making money pushing buttons. If the markets are detached from the fundamentals, why can't we keep resetting it so it goes back . If a year is two short, why not 5 years? Why not make the reset a forced rebuy from the company? idk something . Just dosnt make sense to me that we loan out things we dont have, but we can't just recollect the tickets every year and re buy them correctly? Companies wouldn't have to pay dividends. Just buy the stock back .",

      "selftext": "This relating to the Warner Bros/Netflix/Paramount Skydance bidding war. Now I don't know all the details but from what I was told is that Netflix can't raise their hypothetical counterbid to $35 because shareholders are not enthusiastic about getting WB. Is there any truth to this? I've been told but at the same time I don't think it's not really super clear ro me especially with all that's going on or waiting me into asking this question on why did Netflix even want to pursue Warner Bros if there was going to be problems with acquiring Warner Bros, either from regulators or Paramount being stingy about Warner Bros so much that they are launching a hostile takeover and to get Warner Bros to accept their \"SUPERIOR\" offer? This entire thing is driving me up the wall to where I guess I want to know if Netflix shareholders don't really approve acquisition of Warner Bros meaning Netflix isn't going to raise their bid to $35 Paramount does it. Some people treat this like it's a fact but others kind of come off like it's a no or a unsure thing.",

Now I dont know all the details but from what I was told is that Netflix cant raise their hypothetical counterbid to $ 35 because shareholders are not_enthusiastic about getting WB . Is there any truth to this Ive been told but at the same time I dont think its not_really super clear ro me especially with all thats going on or waiting me into asking this question on why did Netflix even want to pursue Warner Bros if there was going to be problems with acquiring Warner Bros either from regulators or Paramount being stingy about Warner Bros so much that they are launching a hostile takeover and to get Warner Bros to accept their SUPERIOR offer This entire thing is driving me up the wall to where I guess I want to know if Netflix shareholders dont really approve acquisition of Warner Bros meaning Netflix isnt going to raise their bid to $ 35 Paramount does it . Some people treat this like its a fact but others kind of come off like its a no_or a unsure thing ."

      "selftext": "I recently took some profits on my TVTX holdings. As I’m considering my next move, I read a 2026 market outlook that really resonated with me, especially the part about the “tug of war between earnings and valuations” While corporate earnings are expected to grow 15% by 2026, the high P/E ratio of 28 could be at risk of contracting. If valuations revert, the overall market gain for the year might end up being only around 5%. Given that tech stocks now make up almost 50% of the index, VOO itself is basically half an “AI fund. With this expectation of “slower growth,” I’m thinking of adjusting my approach a bit. I don’t want to sell all my individual stocks, but I am planning to move some of my profits into VOO. I’ve noticed a lot of people talking about “rotating into VOO” lately. What are your real reasons for doing so? Is it mainly fear of volatility in individual stocks at these highs, or are you also less optimistic about getting outsized returns going forward?",

      "selftext": "I rarely post on WSB so many of you have basically no reason to trust me but I have traded for a long time and I felt this one is worth sharing. The current probability on Robinhood’s prediction markets for 7k+ close for the year on SPX is about 17%. “The santa clause rally” refers to the last 5 trading days of December and the first two days of January. During this time since the 1950s SPX has finished green around 80% of the time with an average return of 130bps. You couple this with the fact that SPX just broke an ATH, which if you are a trader and don’t know this, more often than not results in a continuation in a uptrend in the short term. There is no macro for next week that should impact the trend, yet despite what I mentioned prior, Robinhood traders are slapping it with a 17% probability over 3 trading days for SPX to gain 100bps. My plan isn’t to hold into the year end close, but to flip these as the return on a 50bps rise would likely net me much more than a 1% OTM option for the same expiration. On top of this, event contracts follow the 60/40 rule meaning 60% of capital gains are automatically taxed as long term, 40% short term, regardless of holding period. Anyways regards, might be worth a look.",

The current probability on Robinhood ’ s prediction markets for 7k close for the year on SPX is about 17 % . “ The santa clause rally ” refers to the last 5 trading days of December and the first two days of January . During this time since the 1950s SPX has finished green around 80 % of the time with an average return of 130bps . You couple this with the fact that SPX just broke an ATH which if you are a trader and don ’ t know this more often than not_results in a continuation in a uptrend in the short term . There is no_macro for next week that should impact the trend yet despite what I mentioned prior Robinhood traders are slapping it with a 17 % probability over 3 trading days for SPX to gain 100bps . My plan isn ’ t to hold into the year end close but to flip these as the return on a 50bps rise would likely net me much more than a 1 % OTM option for the same expiration . On top of this event contracts follow the 6040 rule meaning 60 % of capital gains are automatically taxed as long term 40 % short term regardless of holding period . Anyways regards might be worth a look ."

By Q4 2026: BEARISH: * Carvana (CVNA) goes from $440 → $150 BULLISH: * Celsius (CELH) goes from $45 → $80 Two very different directions. **CVNA:** This thing has been resurrected from the dead already. Massive short squeeze, insane multiple expansion, hype + momentum carrying it way past fundamentals. But at some point, margins, debt, used car demand normalization, competition growing will show. On top of that, Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations!!!!!! a lot of people seem to ignore. Their report claims Carvana’s turnaround optics may be overstated, pointing to aggressive accounting, related-party transactions, and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering. Again, these are *allegations*, not proven facts, but they raise real questions about how “clean” the recovery actually is. If growth slows even a little, or if scrutiny increases, CVNA will not get a soft landing. CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS. It was about to go for BK in 2023. not financial advice **CELH:** On the flip side, CELH feels like a long-term consumer brand compounding story. Distribution keeps expanding, international runway is huge, margins improving, and it’s actually profitable. Expect some volatility. $80 by 2026 isn’t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda. They are also marketing towards healthy energy, as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu. There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper. Just buy, compound, and watch it grow. This should overtake Monster in the future.",

Massive short squeeze insane multiple expansion hype momentum carrying it way past fundamentals . But at some point margins debt used car demand normalization competition growing will show . On top of that Hindenburg Research has laid out some serious allegations a lot of people seem to ignore . Their report claims Carvana ’ s turnaround optics may be overstated pointing to aggressive accounting relatedparty transactions and what they describe as questionable unit economics masked by financial engineering . Again these are allegations not_proven facts but they raise real questions about how “ clean ” the recovery actually is . If growth slows even a little or if scrutiny increases CVNA will not_get a soft landing . CVNA COULD GO TO ZERO IF YOU REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THEY ARE DOING BEHIND THE BOOKS . It was about to go for BK in 2023. not_financial advice CELH On the flip side CELH feels like a longterm consumer brand compounding story . Distribution keeps expanding international runway is huge margins improving and it ’ s actually profitable . Expect some volatility . $ 80 by 2026 isn ’ t crazy if execution stays solid and energy drinks keep stealing share from soda . They are also marketing towards healthy energy as well as tapping into the female market with Alani Nu . There is a bigger thesis for Celsius but I feel like it is obvious to go deeper . Just buy compound and watch it grow . This should overtake Monster in the future ."

      "selftext": "I valued Hims [6 months ago at \\~$34/share.]( Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a low-margin business, subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend, that their fastest growing vertical (GLP-1 meds) faced regulatory hurdles, and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space. I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results, and I actually think it's undervalued by about 20%. Here's why my view has changed. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Hims was operating on razor-thin margins (6.5%) at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse. Based on their latest 10-Q it now sits at 2%. They've invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility ($39M), purchased a lab ($5M), expanded their compounding facility, and signed leases for new warehouse facilities - all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line. In addition, subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP-1 customers has intensified. So what's the justification for the upward revaluation: * Subscriber Growth: 2025 was tough for Hims - the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list, their partnership with Lilly ran afoul, and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums. For context, they added \\~700K new subscribers in 2024, and this year they're on track to add \\~480K new subscribers. In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs, Hims will end 2025 with \\~2.7M paying subscribers. * CAC Paybacks: While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space, Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs. For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longer-term plans (6+ months) with tiered pricing. With a payback period of less than a year, those higher acquisition costs are actually justified. * Master Marketers: Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with near-perfect execution on the marketing front - this was true from the early days of the company and they've maintained that edge ever since. They've established a strong brand presence, are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing. In addition they've been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy. Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb, the site attracts \\~100M visits annually. * Diversified Offering: Hims' stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical - GLP-1 meds. But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering. In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health, mental health, derm conditions, and of late have expanded into lab testing. And on the weight management front, they've restarted their compounded semaglutide offering (the Novo drug) through 503A pharmacies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide (the Lilly med) using the same strategy. Here's how I think things will shake out: * They'll cross $2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to \\~$18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of \\~23%. * They'll pare back their marketing expenses over time (currently at \\~40% of overall revenue) as the company matures and brand awareness builds. And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run, in the long run their margins will improve to \\~12% as operating leverage kicks in. * They have \\~248M shares outstanding (including options and RSUs). One thing to note: they've convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $70 by 2030. I haven't included these in my overall share count since I'm treating the $1B as debt. * Removing debt, adding back cash, their equity is worth \\~$10.7B. Wrapping it all up: Based on my estimates the stock is worth \\~$42/share and is currently undervalued by \\~20% at $34. Let me know what all of you think - would love to hear your thoughts!

      "selftext_processed": "I valued Hims 6 months ago at $ 34share . Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a lowmargin business subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend that their fastest growing vertical GLP1 meds faced regulatory hurdles and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space . I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results and I actually think its undervalued by about 20 % . Heres why my view has changed . Lets get the bad news out of the way first . Hims was operating on razorthin margins 6.5 % at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse . Based on their latest 10Q it now sits at 2 % . Theyve invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility $ 39M purchased a lab $ 5M expanded their compounding facility and signed leases for new warehouse facilities all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line . In addition subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP1 customers has intensified . So whats the justification for the upward revaluation Subscriber Growth 2025 was tough for Hims the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list their partnership with Lilly ran afoul and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums . For context they added 700K new subscribers in 2024 and this year theyre on track to add 480K new subscribers . In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs Hims will end 2025 with 2.7M paying subscribers . CAC Paybacks While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs . For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longerterm plans 6 months with tiered pricing . With a payback period of less than a year those higher acquisition costs are actually justified . Master Marketers Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with nearperfect execution on the marketing front this was true from the early days of the company and theyve maintained that edge ever since . Theyve established a strong brand presence are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing . In addition theyve been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy . Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb the site attracts 100M visits annually . Diversified Offering Hims stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical GLP1 meds . But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering . In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health mental health derm conditions and of late have expanded into lab testing . And on the weight management front theyve restarted their compounded semaglutide offering the Novo drug through 503A pharmacies and I wouldnt be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide the Lilly med using the same strategy . Heres how I think things will shake out Theyll cross $ 2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to $ 18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of 23 % . Theyll pare back their marketing expenses over time currently at 40 % of overall revenue as the company matures and brand awareness builds . And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run in the long run their margins will improve to 12 % as operating leverage kicks in . They have 248M shares outstanding including options and RSUs . One thing to note theyve convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $ 70 by 2030 . I havent included these in my overall share count since Im treating the $ 1B as debt . Removing debt adding back cash their equity is worth $ 10.7B . Wrapping it all up Based on my estimates the stock is worth $ 42share and is currently undervalued by 20 % at $ 34 . Let me know what all of you think would love to hear your thoughts submitsource_idt3_1pvm12n"

      "selftext": "South Korean memory manufacturers Samsung (SSNLF) and SK Hynix have reportedly raised prices for their fifth generation high bandwidth memory (HBM3E) chips by 20%, with deliveries expected in 2026. The HBM3E price hike comes amid surging demand for advanced memory chips driven by the rise of AI applications. This surge occurs as memory manufacturers prepare to shift resources toward HBM4 chips typically when prices for the previous generation begin to weaken. NVIDIA (NVDA), Google (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have all increased memory requirements for new AI chips. I plan to use $500,000 to steadily increase holdings in Samsung and Nvidia, aiming to complete this plan by January 2026. Do you think holding these positions for 2-3 years could double my investment?",

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future . I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future . For example VEQT XEQT ZEQT have a Canada bias . While FLIN is well established with $ 2.85B in AUM IND is brand new only started in Nov 2025 with AUM of only $ 4.97M . Both have same MER 0.19 % . I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 diversity of underlying stocks . However the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high . It is also from a company I have never_heard of . The MER on INDA is much higher at 0.62 % . And the Canadian XID MER is insane at 0.99 % . FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND . However is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment"

      "selftext": "Back in early June, I came across MU through a stock screener and started keeping an eye on the company. By mid-June, I noticed the stock was on a consistent upward trend, so I dove deeper into my research. Based on my findings, I made the decision to start building a position around $113. Fast forward to today, and my MU holdings now account for 40% of my portfolio. After Christmas, the stock rose another 10 points, reaching an impressive $287. This is the most money I’ve made in a stock, and honestly, it’s the best Christmas gift I could’ve asked for. Now, I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep adding to my position and maintain the high-risk, high-reward strategy, or do I start taking some profits off the table and reduce my exposure to lock in these gains? Do you think Micron’s future potential can keep this momentum going, or is the stock price approaching a temporary peak?",

      "selftext": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS, but are they really a great investment when they're priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader? Why space stocks will struggle in 2026: 1. Space business requires a ton of capital, that means constant dilution. Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS, just to start generating revenue. 2. Space will always have very high \"cost of revenue\" associated with it, will always have high R&D, and G&A, yet they're priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low R&Ds and G&As. 3. Space is dangerous, one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight. For instance, ASTS has to launch 100+ satellites (they launched 1 in all of 2025) and one setback and they're immediately months behind schedule. There's a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks. 4. Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepest-pocketed billionaire in the world. SpaceX just spent $20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS. SpaceX is also about 3-5 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets. 5. Both companies are still playing catch-up to SpaceX. In the case of ASTS, they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future. 6. SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest, why own a second-fiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader? Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA? I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd. RKLB trading at 70 Price-to-Sales ratio. ASTS is still a per-revenue company yet it's valued at close to $30 billion!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "Every thread here and elsewhere asking about top picks for 2026 has at least one space stock recommendation like RKLB or ASTS but are they really a great investment when theyre priced for perfection and at higher multiples than the industry leader Why space stocks will struggle in 2026 1 . Space business requires a ton of capital that means constant dilution . Both companies have tripled and quadrupled their shares in just few years but will still need much more capital to reach breakeven or in the case of ASTS just to start generating revenue . 2 . Space will always have very high cost of revenue associated with it will always have high RD and GA yet theyre priced like software companies with low cost of revenue and low RDs and GAs . 3 . Space is dangerous one thing goes wrong and the stock takes a massive hit overnight . For instance ASTS has to launch 100 satellites they launched 1 in all of 2025 and one setback and theyre immediately months behind schedule . Theres a risk discount that should always be assigned to space stocks . 4 . Both companies are competing against the most dominant space company and the richest and deepestpocketed billionaire in the world . SpaceX just spent $ 20 billion to acquire global spectrum that will make their path to offering D2D service so much easier and quicker than ASTS . SpaceX is also about 35 years ahead of RKLB on tech and reusable rockets . 5 . Both companies are still playing catchup to SpaceX . In the case of ASTS they mostly depend on SpaceX to launch their satellites in the near future . 6 . SpaceX IPO will literally wipe out most retail and institutional interest why own a secondfiddle wannabe when you can own the real leader Why buy RIVN or LCID when you can buy TSLA I still think space companies will make great investments in 2026 but some of the current valuations are absurd . RKLB trading at 70 PricetoSales ratio . ASTS is still a perrevenue company yet its valued at close to $ 30 billion"

The reasoning for investing in Indian ETF is there is a possibility of me retiring in India in the distant future. I have read that you should have a tilt towards where you will be spending your investment return in the future. For example, VEQT / XEQT / ZEQT have a Canada bias. While FLIN is well established with $2.85B in AUM, IND is brand new (only started in Nov 2025) with AUM of only $4.97M. Both have same MER 0.19%. I am interested in IND because it seems to an Indian equivalent of SP500 / diversity of underlying stocks. However, the newness troubles me and seems like the buy sell spread on IND is also quite high. It is also from a company I have never heard of. The MER on [INDA]( is much higher at 0.62%. And the Canadian [XID]( MER is insane at 0.99%. FLIN has about half the stock tickers present in IND. However, is IND actually better in the long run because it is potentially a more diverse investment?",

In early October, I noticed the stock was moving up in a steady, consistent trend, so I took a deeper look at the company’s fundamentals. Based on that, I opened a position around **$25**. So far, TVTX has performed pretty much in line with my expectations, and the trend has been solid. Now that the stock is trading around **$42**, I’m feeling a bit unsure. Do you see this level as a key resistance, or just a short-term consolidation before another move higher? Curious to hear how others are thinking about the risks and opportunities at this price",

In early October I noticed the stock was moving up in a steady consistent trend so I took a deeper look at the company ’ s fundamentals . Based on that I opened a position around $ 25 . So far TVTX has performed pretty much in line with my expectations and the trend has been solid . Now that the stock is trading around $ 42 I ’ m feeling a bit unsure . Do you see this level as a key resistance or just a shortterm consolidation before another move higher Curious to hear how others are thinking about the risks and opportunities at this price"

      "title": "Risks for Venture Global stock",
      "selftext": "Based on 3Q earnings, Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030. Additionally, they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already. These agreements are mostly long-term supply and purchase agreements (SPAs) lasting a duration of 20 years. LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades, primarily in Asia, due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies, coal-to-gas switching and decarbonization, and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption. My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs, priced at around US$5-7/mmbtu. Hence, this serves as a source of long-term stable revenues. Of course, the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals. Additionally, it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP, who are some of the off-takers of its LNG cargoes. They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP. Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the Russia-Ukraine war. I am unsure of what is the long-term impact of these legal battles, but I think it should not affect the long-term business case. I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity. The LNG market seems to be growing healthily. As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects, I would think that the stock price can easily hit 15-18 dollars within the next 1-2 years. I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis?",

      "selftext_processed": "Based on 3Q earnings Venture Global reported that they have 67 mtpa of LNG capacity in operation or under construction and that number will reach 100 mtpa by 2030 . Additionally they have secured offtake agreements for 45 mtpa already . These agreements are mostly longterm supply and purchase agreements SPAs lasting a duration of 20 years . LNG demand is poised to grow over the next 2 decades primarily in Asia due to energy consumption growth in many developing economies coaltogas switching and decarbonization and also due to growth in AI data centre power consumption . My understanding is that they make money from liquefaction fees that are specified in these SPAs priced at around US $ 57mmbtu . Hence this serves as a source of longterm stable revenues . Of course the company is currently taking on large amounts of debt to finance the construction of the various natural gas liquefaction terminals . Additionally it is currently embroiled in legal issues with Shell and BP who are some of the offtakers of its LNG cargoes . They won the case against Shell but lost the case against BP . Venture Global has been accused by these companies of not_abiding by the terms of these SPAs when they sold their commissioning cargoes for one of their projects on the spot market for large profits during the period of high LNG prices brought about by the RussiaUkraine war . I am unsure of what is the longterm impact of these legal battles but I think it should not_affect the longterm business case . I am relatively optimistic about the future performance of $ VG as it will soon grow to a size comparable to Cheniere and will also exceed it in LNG export capacity . The LNG market seems to be growing healthily . As long as they can find buyers for their capacity and execute on their projects I would think that the stock price can easily hit 1518 dollars within the next 12 years . I am curious if there are any risks that I may have missed out in my current analysis"

      "selftext": "As we all know, MU has been doing exceptionally well this last year and the outlook so far is only up. I've kept almost all of my RSU's and ESPP that I've gotten from MU for the last year or two and needless to say it's grown significantly in size and now I'm not sure what to do with them. Option 1 is just keep them all and ride the wave for as long as I can, but historically MU is very cyclical and when it goes down, it goes down hard. The AI revolution helps with this, but it isn't a cure. Option 2 is sell and diversify into other stuff. Outside of this I follow a typical boglehead strategy and it's worked well for me. I would only sell RSUs first and wait until ESPPs become long term for tax advantages (\\~6 months for 1 group, 1 year for another). My holdup is since MU has done so well over the last year, keeping until the new fab(s) come online could have some insane gains that I don't want to miss out on. On the other hand, selling and diversifying gets me all the compounded gains up until the same point, it's a question of which one is likely to make more. I suppose option 3 could be to sell half and keep half to get a piece of both cakes? Not sure, looking for some advice. Thanks.",

Ive kept almost all of my RSUs and ESPP that Ive gotten from MU for the last year or two and needless to say its grown significantly in size and now Im not_sure what to do with them . Option 1 is just keep them all and ride the wave for as long as I can but historically MU is very cyclical and when it goes down it goes down hard . The AI revolution helps with this but it isnt a cure . Option 2 is sell and diversify into other stuff . Outside of this I follow a typical boglehead strategy and its worked well for me . I would only sell RSUs first and wait until ESPPs become long term for tax advantages 6 months for 1 group 1 year for another . My holdup is since MU has done so well over the last year keeping until the new fabs come online could have some insane gains that I dont want to miss out on . On the other hand selling and diversifying gets me all the compounded gains up until the same point its a question of which one is likely to make more . I suppose option 3 could be to sell half and keep half to get a piece of both cakes Not_sure looking for some advice . Thanks ."

      "title": "POET - An engineer's perspective",
      "selftext": "I kept seeing $POET floated around as a potential big play. Having not known anything about the company, I decided to do some personal due diligence. A little about my background. I am a mechanical engineering PhD with a specialization in robotics and artificial intelligence. I am the co-founder of a company launching it's first product in 2026 as well as an adjunct professor at a university occasionally. TL;DR - $POET could pull off a huge win and dominate the market, but I think the headwinds are too strong and it's more likely they run out of confidence and money before they get there. I am staying away. The risk does not warrant the payoff. First, let's break down their technology. Copper is frequently used for data transmission. It's cheap, it's easy to work with, and it's rugged. However, it's slow. To get around this, technologies like fiberoptics have emerged which send data at the theoretical maximum - the speed of light. Fiberoptics are great for long distances (like across an ocean) because the bulky equipment can be hosed on the ends of the run. However, the LASERs and lenses can't really fit on a chip for shark scale fast data transport. $POET wants to shrink this down by essentially making a shoe for the interconnect to get fast data transfer at small scale. This technology isn't particularly new, but it's been held back by manufacturing and this is where my personal expertise is putting up massive red flags. This is where I'll get into the critical details. My company I co-founded is in the high technology ceramics field which has a lot of similarities to what $POET is trying to pull off. $POET's big problem isn't the usefulness of its technology (it works and it would be a game changer), the problem is manufacturing yields and this is the same problem ceramics face. Both the core part I make and $POET's part relies heavily on manufacturing yields. Unlike traditional manufacturing which have ductile materials which can be shaped and manipulated after manufacturing to pass QA, ceramics and microelectronics have to be made in one shot and the result is binary - either it passes QA or it fails. Anyone who has made a pot in high school or something has probably experienced this. The clay pot goes into the kiln and it can come out cracked or broken. You're essentially gambling each time you make a part and your goal is to make the odds in your favor. You want the probability of success as high as possible (95+% success rate) out the failed parts cost so much that you can't make money on the good parts. To make matters worse, $POET cannot directly test each part to ensure it's passed QA. At my company we can't either and it's a real challenge. The way to handle this challenge is to use statistical process control (SPC) to get your yields high and stable. You make thousands of parts and test enough of them that you can be confident your yield numbers are what you think they are. As an example, say your manufacturing process has a yield rate of 70% (a number so low you can't be profitable) and you process 10 parts. It's very possible you get lucky and 9 out of 10 parts come out good. Now it feels like you have a yield of 90%, but the reality is you got lucky and you wouldn't see the 70% until you made 1,000 parts. Now you have false confidence and you push forward only for it to blow up in your face. The only way to make sure your yields are where you think your are is to make thousands of parts and that can burn cash very, very quickly. So that's a huge barrier for $POET, but expected in this industry. However, this isn't the biggest red flag to me. The biggest red flag is the fact $POET is not doing the manufacturing themselves! They have taken the most critical challenge they faced and pushed it onto other fab companies in hopes they can figure it out. They don't control their process! And if one of their partners do manage to figure it out (very difficult, but let's take the optimistic case) then this supplier has HUGE leverage over $POET because they are the only supplier. The partner could start jacking up the price on $POET because they're the only option they have. At my company, we've done manufacturing in house. We believe in our technology and our ability to execute. We control our destiny. $POET does not control their destiny and the fact they are not trying to do this in house tells me they do not have the expertise or confidence in themselves to solve the critical problems. They're hoping they can hype people up with some demonstrations of working parts before the bottom falls out and everyone learns they can make the parts cheap enough. I have considered puts here, but they could hype people up enough in the short term to send the stock sky high before crashing down to reality. I think the best play here is to stay away. You have better odds in Vegas.",

      "selftext_processed": "I kept seeing $ POET floated around as a potential big play . Having not_known anything about the company I decided to do some personal due diligence . A little about my background . I am a mechanical engineering PhD with a specialization in robotics and artificial intelligence . I am the cofounder of a company launching its first product in 2026 as well as an adjunct professor at a university occasionally . TLDR $ POET could pull off a huge win and dominate the market but I think the headwinds are too strong and its more likely they run out of confidence and money before they get there . I am staying away . The risk does not_warrant the payoff . First lets break down their technology . Copper is frequently used for data transmission . Its cheap its easy to work with and its rugged . However its slow . To get around this technologies like fiberoptics have emerged which send data at the theoretical maximum the speed of light . Fiberoptics are great for long distances like across an ocean because the bulky equipment can be hosed on the ends of the run . However the LASERs and lenses cant really fit on a chip for shark scale fast data transport . $ POET wants to shrink this down by essentially making a shoe for the interconnect to get fast data transfer at small scale . This technology isnt particularly new but its been held back by manufacturing and this is where my personal expertise is putting up massive red flags . This is where Ill get into the critical details . My company I cofounded is in the high technology ceramics field which has a lot of similarities to what $ POET is trying to pull off . $ POETs big problem isnt the usefulness of its technology it works and it would be a game changer the problem is manufacturing yields and this is the same problem ceramics face . Both the core part I make and $ POETs part relies heavily on manufacturing yields . Unlike traditional manufacturing which have ductile materials which can be shaped and manipulated after manufacturing to pass QA ceramics and microelectronics have to be made in one shot and the result is binary either it passes QA or it fails . Anyone who has made a pot in high school or something has probably experienced this . The clay pot goes into the kiln and it can come out cracked or broken . Youre essentially gambling each time you make a part and your goal is to make the odds in your favor . You want the probability of success as high as possible 95 % success rate out the failed parts cost so much that you cant make money on the good parts . To make matters worse $ POET can not directly test each part to ensure its passed QA . At my company we cant either and its a real challenge . The way to handle this challenge is to use statistical process control SPC to get your yields high and stable . You make thousands of parts and test enough of them that you can be confident your yield numbers are what you think they are . As an example say your manufacturing process has a yield rate of 70 % a number so low you cant be profitable and you process 10 parts . Its very possible you get lucky and 9 out of 10 parts come out good . Now it feels like you have a yield of 90 % but the reality is you got lucky and you wouldnt see the 70 % until you made 1000 parts . Now you have false confidence and you push forward only for it to blow up in your face . The only way to make sure your yields are where you think your are is to make thousands of parts and that can burn cash very very quickly . So thats a huge barrier for $ POET but expected in this industry . However this isnt the biggest red flag to me . The biggest red flag is the fact $ POET is not_doing the manufacturing themselves They have taken the most critical challenge they faced and pushed it onto other fab companies in hopes they can figure it out . They dont control their process And if one of their partners do manage to figure it out very difficult but lets take the optimistic case then this supplier has HUGE leverage over $ POET because they are the only supplier . The partner could start jacking up the price on $ POET because theyre the only option they have . At my company weve done manufacturing in house . We believe in our technology and our ability to execute . We control our destiny . $ POET does not_control their destiny and the fact they are not_trying to do this in house tells me they do not_have the expertise or confidence in themselves to solve the critical problems . Theyre hoping they can hype people up with some demonstrations of working parts before the bottom falls out and everyone learns they can make the parts cheap enough . I have considered puts here but they could hype people up enough in the short term to send the stock sky high before crashing down to reality . I think the best play here is to stay away . You have better odds in Vegas ."

Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned.

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic .

Groq cofounder Ross was also there making deals with the Saudis . I just think this paints the Nvidia deal with Groq in a bit of a different light and provides some additional perspective as to how it may relate to Humain Aramco Digital and the deals with the Saudis in general . “ The CEO of the statebacked AI and data center company Humain which is also working with Groq previously told CNBC that it ’ s ambition is to become the “ thirdlargest AI provider in the world behind the United States and China . ” ’"

      "title": "HIMS Might be Undervalued by ~ 20%?",
      "selftext": "I valued Hims [6 months ago at \\~$34/share.]( Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a low-margin business, subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend, that their fastest growing vertical (GLP-1 meds) faced regulatory hurdles, and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space. I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results, and I actually think it's undervalued by about 20%. Here's why my view has changed. Let's get the bad news out of the way first. Hims was operating on razor-thin margins (6.5%) at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse. Based on their latest 10-Q it now sits at 2%. They've invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility ($39M), purchased a lab ($5M), expanded their compounding facility, and signed leases for new warehouse facilities - all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line. In addition, subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP-1 customers has intensified. So what's the justification for the upward revaluation: * Subscriber Growth: 2025 was tough for Hims - the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list, their partnership with Lilly ran afoul, and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums. For context, they added \\~700K new subscribers in 2024, and this year they're on track to add \\~480K new subscribers. In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs, Hims will end 2025 with \\~2.7M paying subscribers. * CAC Paybacks: While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space, Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs. For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longer-term plans (6+ months) with tiered pricing. With a payback period of less than a year, those higher acquisition costs are actually justified. * Master Marketers: Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with near-perfect execution on the marketing front - this was true from the early days of the company and they've maintained that edge ever since. They've established a strong brand presence, are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing. In addition they've been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy. Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb, the site attracts \\~100M visits annually. * Diversified Offering: Hims' stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical - GLP-1 meds. But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering. In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health, mental health, derm conditions, and of late have expanded into lab testing. And on the weight management front, they've restarted their compounded semaglutide offering (the Novo drug) through 503A pharmacies, and I wouldn't be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide (the Lilly med) using the same strategy. Here's how I think things will shake out: * They'll cross $2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to \\~$18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of \\~23%. * They'll pare back their marketing expenses over time (currently at \\~40% of overall revenue) as the company matures and brand awareness builds. And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run, in the long run their margins will improve to \\~12% as operating leverage kicks in. * They have \\~248M shares outstanding (including options and RSUs). One thing to note: they've convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $70 by 2030. I haven't included these in my overall share count since I'm treating the $1B as debt. * Removing debt, adding back cash, their equity is worth \\~$10.7B. Wrapping it all up: Based on my estimates the stock is worth \\~$42/share and is currently undervalued by \\~20% at $34. Let me know what all of you think - would love to hear your thoughts!",

      "selftext_processed": "I valued Hims 6 months ago at $ 34share . Back then my main thesis was that telehealth was a lowmargin business subscriber growth was fueled by gobs of marketing spend that their fastest growing vertical GLP1 meds faced regulatory hurdles and the business competed in a fragmented and highly competitive D2C space . I decided to take another look at Hims after they published their Q3 results and I actually think its undervalued by about 20 % . Heres why my view has changed . Lets get the bad news out of the way first . Hims was operating on razorthin margins 6.5 % at the start of the year and on the efficiency front it has somehow managed to make things even worse . Based on their latest 10Q it now sits at 2 % . Theyve invested heavily in acquiring a peptide manufacturing facility $ 39M purchased a lab $ 5M expanded their compounding facility and signed leases for new warehouse facilities all of which have yet to meaningfully contribute to the top line . In addition subscriber acquisition costs have shot up significantly YoY as competition for GLP1 customers has intensified . So whats the justification for the upward revaluation Subscriber Growth 2025 was tough for Hims the FDA took semaglutide off the shortage list their partnership with Lilly ran afoul and the inability to sell compounded meds put a dent in their subscriber growth nums . For context they added 700K new subscribers in 2024 and this year theyre on track to add 480K new subscribers . In spite of the growth setbacks and increased acquisition costs Hims will end 2025 with 2.7M paying subscribers . CAC Paybacks While customer acquisition costs have increased due to competitive intensity in the GLP space Hims has been smart about quickly recouping those costs . For example on the GLP side they subtly push customers toward their longerterm plans 6 months with tiered pricing . With a payback period of less than a year those higher acquisition costs are actually justified . Master Marketers Hims has been terrific at scaling growth with nearperfect execution on the marketing front this was true from the early days of the company and theyve maintained that edge ever since . Theyve established a strong brand presence are on track to spend close to a billion dollars on marketing . In addition theyve been creative about complementing their paid media spend with a strong organic growth strategy . Based on traffic estimates from Similarweb the site attracts 100M visits annually . Diversified Offering Hims stock price seems to be inexplicably tied to one single health vertical GLP1 meds . But in reality it has a way more diversified product offering . In addition to weight management they offer treatments for sexual health mental health derm conditions and of late have expanded into lab testing . And on the weight management front theyve restarted their compounded semaglutide offering the Novo drug through 503A pharmacies and I wouldnt be surprised if they get back into offering compounded tirzepatide the Lilly med using the same strategy . Heres how I think things will shake out Theyll cross $ 2B in revenues by the end of this year and scale up to $ 18B over the next 10 years with a CAGR of 23 % . Theyll pare back their marketing expenses over time currently at 40 % of overall revenue as the company matures and brand awareness builds . And though their heavy capex investments are hurting them in the short run in the long run their margins will improve to 12 % as operating leverage kicks in . They have 248M shares outstanding including options and RSUs . One thing to note theyve convertible notes which have the potential to dilute shareholders should the stock price cross $ 70 by 2030 . I havent included these in my overall share count since Im treating the $ 1B as debt . Removing debt adding back cash their equity is worth $ 10.7B . Wrapping it all up Based on my estimates the stock is worth $ 42share and is currently undervalued by 20 % at $ 34 . Let me know what all of you think would love to hear your thoughts"

      "title": "Strategy behind Nvidia’s Groq deal",
      "selftext": "Nvidia paid $20 billion in the Groq deal to secure exclusive access to Groq’s AI inference technology and talent with the aim of dominating the rapidly growing market for real-time AI processing. Nvidia licensed Groq’s Language Processing Unit (LPU) tech which is custom AI inference chips optimized for ultra-low latency and high throughput. What is the strategy? Nvidia brought in Groq’s founder Jonathan Ross (ex-Google TPU architect), President Sunny Madra, and other key engineers to integrate and scale the tech internally within Nvidia. Nvidia is highly focused on AI training through their GPUs, but Groq excels in inference which runs trained models in real time. This deal strengthens Nvidia’s position across the full AI pipeline with AI inference market expansion. Groq was a rising competitor. Nvidia’s move preemptively neutralizes a competitive threat while avoiding a full acquisition that might trigger regulatory scrutiny. The deal is structured as a non-exclusive licensing agreement rather than a full acquisition, as it allows Groq to remain independent while Nvidia gains the core IP and talent. Why pay a high valuation? Groq’s LPUs are already production ready and outperform traditional GPUs in specific inference tasks so speed to market was likely a factor Nvidia valued. By structuring the deal as a licensing + talent acquisition, Nvidia avoids antitrust hurdles that a full acquisition might trigger. Nvidia had over $60B in cash and short term investments so this deal was a bold but affordable bet on future AI dominance. What happens to Groq? Groq remains an independent company, now led by new CEO Simon Edwards. Its cloud platform, GroqCloud, continues operating separately. Nvidia gains the tech and team, but not the full company. This deal is a textbook example of a “strategic acqui-hire plus IP licensing” move.",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia paid $ 20 billion in the Groq deal to secure exclusive access to Groq ’ s AI inference technology and talent with the aim of dominating the rapidly growing market for realtime AI processing . Nvidia licensed Groq ’ s Language Processing Unit LPU tech which is custom AI inference chips optimized for ultralow latency and high throughput . What is the strategy Nvidia brought in Groq ’ s founder Jonathan Ross exGoogle TPU architect President Sunny Madra and other key engineers to integrate and scale the tech internally within Nvidia . Nvidia is highly focused on AI training through their GPUs but Groq excels in inference which runs trained models in real time . This deal strengthens Nvidia ’ s position across the full AI pipeline with AI inference market expansion . Groq was a rising competitor . Nvidia ’ s move preemptively neutralizes a competitive threat while avoiding a full acquisition that might trigger regulatory scrutiny . The deal is structured as a nonexclusive licensing agreement rather than a full acquisition as it allows Groq to remain independent while Nvidia gains the core IP and talent . Why pay a high valuation Groq ’ s LPUs are already production ready and outperform traditional GPUs in specific inference tasks so speed to market was likely a factor Nvidia valued . By structuring the deal as a licensing talent acquisition Nvidia avoids antitrust hurdles that a full acquisition might trigger . Nvidia had over $ 60B in cash and short term investments so this deal was a bold but affordable bet on future AI dominance . What happens to Groq Groq remains an independent company now led by new CEO Simon Edwards . Its cloud platform GroqCloud continues operating separately . Nvidia gains the tech and team but not_the full company . This deal is a textbook example of a “ strategic acquihire plus IP licensing ” move ."

Im going through a very hard time dealing with it mentally feeling like I just set myself back years of money I had saved up and in general feeling set back significantly in life due to these financial losses . I understand the obvious thing is to not_get involved with any more day trading and options moving forward but how do i rebuild back my finances in a smart way in the most time efficient manner and at the same time mentally deal with what im going through to avoid feeling like im having to start back from the beginning at this age at this point in my life"

      "title": "Top Quality DD on ETH: High Conviction trade since my last DD on META (hand written not AI)",
      "selftext": "Alright, regards, if you had been following my last DD on META, you would’ve done really well. Since that DD post, my position has been up moderately + I’ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call (I bought back when I’m up 50% and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility). I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits. TLDR: Fundamentally: Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation. BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream (around 2021 to present). I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then. Macro/Policy: The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer. Bullish for commodities. Thesis: Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn’t over yet. Short/Medium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 (according to scott bessent). DD starts here: I’m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas. ETH, some people call it digital silver, some people call it the backbone of Wall Street, some people call it a scam (I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it). Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade, and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately, while others are still amazed at his haircut. All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue - is Ethereum worth anything, or is it just fairy dust? In my DD, I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won’t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium. **What is value?** The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield. Which is why we can value a stock, because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric, gold/silver/BTC/ETH are all the same - they have no intrinsic value as they don’t earn you any money just by holding them. Which leads us to the next question: why are gold and silver doing so well, while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage? **What is price? How are commodities priced?** There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity. The most common factors include: utility, scarcity, trust/credibility, cost to carry, supply and demand, and most importantly market sentiment (mass psychology). For gold and silver specifically, they have limited in supply (on earth) and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not only as commodities but also as currencies. In terms of utility, Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below. However, if you just look at supply vs demand, you would realized they are not off by much and it’s not really the driver for gold price (same for silver). **What is the real driver for price?** As mentioned earlier, gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not just as commodities, but as currencies. So much so that they are considered risk-off assets (or save haven when shit hits the fan). Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks. In other words, gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver. (as shown in chart below) Like the stock market, gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply (aka inflation). On top of that, gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens. Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety. **What about BTC and ETH?** There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver. For example, BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world’s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain (similar to gold, it became a much more volatile version of store of value). And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets (sounds like silver when it comes to utility). The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024. While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions, ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets. So far, 65% of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant, the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030. So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network. While it sounded like a greenflag on paper, I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag. ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH (as projection chart shows below, the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years + ETH gives a dividend), I find this to be shady and don’t really buy it. On top of that, I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price. But if the supply projection holds true, ETH will be much closer to the digital silver. Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies, the correlation between BTC/ETH and M2 says it all. Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021. And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period. So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset? This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal, a FinTech strategist at Autonomous. Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed. In the early years, crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money, so it was less correlated with equities. After COVID, easier access through exchanges, large retail participation, and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios. As a result, BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite, which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold. This does not mean BTC and ETH will always trade like high-beta stocks. As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and long-term holders, their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints, network usage, and monetary demand rather than short-term liquidity cycles. Over time, this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities, where value is tied to money supply, instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment. **The Inflationary Policy & Macro effects** Trump has taken extensive measures (manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed) to keep the USD weak and interest rate low (to maintain export advantage + service the 38 trillion debt) despite high level of inflation. The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury (kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world). The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market. Which could be inflationary. **Short Term Catalyst for ETH: Tokenization** In 2025, the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones, including: * SEC roundtables on tokenization; platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US. * BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs; industry leaders predict massive market growth. * Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026; Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street. And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption. CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network: To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization, the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below. So far, 90% of tokenized assets are stable coin (which ETH dominates) and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network **So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end?** Since late October, the stock market has been choppy rather than trending. Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened, which caused systematic investors like CTAs and vol-targeting funds to reduce exposure. In this environment, BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds, not because of panic, but because risk appetite never fully returned. Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious. So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown. The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into year-end, which suggests sentiment is still intact. Most notably, the AI sector has remained strong. Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding, showing that growth expectations have not collapsed. As equity volatility compresses and risk-on sentiment improves, this gives the market room to grind higher. If that happens, liquidity and positioning should rotate back into high-beta assets, which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026. Looking at the ETH chart, the day candle is showing stabilization and I don’t see why it wouldn’t revisit ATH and break above $5,250 in Q1 2026. **My expression for this bet: BMNR (I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4% at the time of purchase)** As I think ETH could re-visit 5k in Q1 2026, BMNR is the perfect pick. I pick it for 3 reasons: 1. No debt - so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR (which is also starting to price in not being included into S&P 500). 2. Premium to NAV expansion - if my thesis plays out, Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels: 1.3x - 1.5x (which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world). 3. I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear. (for reasons I mentioned earlier, the ETH network is doing great, far from a bear market - so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift). **Position**: I even bought for my TFSA:",

      "selftext_processed": "Alright regards if you had been following my last DD on META you would ’ ve done really well . Since that DD post my position has been up moderately I ’ ve been getting really good yield on the covered calls written against my longer dated call I bought back when I ’ m up 50 % and sell another call when the stock rallies with climbing implied volatility . I will still follow my original trade plan in my previous DD post for exits and take profits . TLDR Fundamentally Gold and Silver are mainly driven by money supply aka inflation . BTC and ETH are sharing this trend since they were gradually adopted by institutions and mainstream around 2021 to present . I am arguing that BTC and ETH are acting more and more like commodities since then . MacroPolicy The current administration is keeping inflation higher for longer . Bullish for commodities . Thesis Commodity will move higher with inflation and BTC and ETH in particular will experience a catch up trade as the current cycle isn ’ t over yet . ShortMedium term catalyst for ETH is the tokenization of stock security and long term catalyst for ETH is stablecoin market cap will 10x by 2030 according to scott bessent . DD starts here I ’ m here today to make you all a bit more money for Christmas . ETH some people call it digital silver some people call it the backbone of Wall Street some people call it a scam I think quite a few of these people have lost money on it . Tom Lee has called it the macro trade of the decade and more people are calling Tom Lee a con artist lately while others are still amazed at his haircut . All the noise makes it hard to focus on the main issue is Ethereum worth anything or is it just fairy dust In my DD I want to focus on the first principles of things so you won ’ t be reading an AI slop or some useless rambling of hopium . What is value The traditional value investing way of computing the intrinsic value of an asset is by looking at all the future cash flow this asset can yield . Which is why we can value a stock because owning the stock is partially owning the future cash flow the company generates By this metric goldsilverBTCETH are all the same they have no_intrinsic value as they don ’ t earn you any money just by holding them . Which leads us to the next question why are gold and silver doing so well while BTC and ETH are trading like hot garbage What is price How are commodities priced There are many factors that influence the price of a commodity . The most common factors include utility scarcity trustcredibility cost to carry supply and demand and most importantly market sentiment mass psychology . For gold and silver specifically they have limited in supply on earth and have been around for a long time where people have trust in them not_only as commodities but also as currencies . In terms of utility Silver has various industrial utility due to its superior conductivity and gold has a stable demand in many industries shown in the graph below . However if you just look at supply vs demand you would realized they are not_off by much and it ’ s not_really the driver for gold price same for silver . What is the real driver for price As mentioned earlier gold and silver have been around long enough for people to trust them not_just as commodities but as currencies . So much so that they are considered riskoff assets or save haven when shit hits the fan . Central banks build reserves with gold to maintain their monetary system credibility in and preserve national wealth against various economic risks . In other words gold and silver are strongly linked to fiat currency and we can use money supply as a proxy for gold and silver . as shown in chart below Like the stock market gold and silver prices goes up with the increasing money supply aka inflation . On top of that gold and silver has demonstrated to be the safe haven when a crisis happens . Both gold and silver had a massive rally in 2011 during the global financial crisis as everyone thought the U.S. financial system was going to collapse and piled their money into gold and silver for safety . What about BTC and ETH There are certainly similarities for BTC and ETH when compared to gold and silver . For example BTC also has a fixed total supply and is the world ’ s first ever decentralized payment network based on the blockchain similar to gold it became a much more volatile version of store of value . And ETH took blockchain a step further and became a global computing network that allowed programmers to build decentralized applications used to tokenize any assets sounds like silver when it comes to utility . The photo below illustrates the market value of tokenized assets and transactions on the ETH network in 2024 . While ETH only shares a tiny portion of the TAM in these transactions ETH is definitely a leader in terms of the tokenization of assets . So far 65 % of stablecoin runs via ETH and according to Scott Bessant the market cap of stablecoin will grow ten fold into 2030 . So it definitely sounds like a ton of upside for this network . While it sounded like a greenflag on paper I consider the ETH supply to be a red flag . ETH bulls like to say ETH has a burning mechanism on a portion of the transactional fees that creates a deflationary effect on ETH as projection chart shows below the total supply of ETH is projected to decline in the coming years ETH gives a dividend I find this to be shady and don ’ t really buy it . On top of that I think the switching cost is too high given ETH network has a pretty expensive transactional fee aka gas price . But if the supply projection holds true ETH will be much closer to the digital silver . Regardless of how many gold and silver traits BTC and ETH embodies the correlation between BTCETH and M2 says it all . Both commodities are starting to show correlation with money supply and the stock market since 2021 . And the reason why I picked this time frame is because both BTC and ETH started to gain adoption from the mainstream and institutions during the period . So why does it feels like BTC and ETH are trading with the stock market like a risk on asset This explanation is based on an interview by Steve Eisman with Rahul Jindal a FinTech strategist at Autonomous . Jindal explains that BTC and ETH began trading more like stocks after 2019 because the type of investor holding crypto changed . In the early years crypto was mostly owned by early adopters who viewed it as a hedge against banks and fiat money so it was less correlated with equities . After COVID easier access through exchanges large retail participation and excess liquidity caused crypto to be held alongside stocks in investor portfolios . As a result BTC and ETH became sensitive to money supply and risk appetite which explains why they have moved closely with the stock market since 2021 rather than behaving like gold . This does not_mean BTC and ETH will always trade like highbeta stocks . As adoption matures and ownership shifts further toward institutions and longterm holders their prices are more likely to be driven by supply constraints network usage and monetary demand rather than shortterm liquidity cycles . Over time this would allow BTC and ETH to behave more like commodities where value is tied to money supply instead of purely reacting to stock market sentiment . The Inflationary Policy Macro effects Trump has taken extensive measures manipulating the BLS jobs data and putting pressure on the Fed to keep the USD weak and interest rate low to maintain export advantage service the 38 trillion debt despite high level of inflation . The promotion of stablecoin also introduces more inflation as people around the globe can now purchase USD backed by treasury kinda like the U.S can issue debt to the entire world . The end of the quantitative tightening is another catalyst to at least support more liquidity coming into the equity and capital market . Which could be inflationary . Short Term Catalyst for ETH Tokenization In 2025 the tokenization of stocks reach several milestones including SEC roundtables on tokenization platforms like Ondo launch tokenized stocks outside the US . BlackRock explores tokenized ETFs industry leaders predict massive market growth . Nasdaq files to list tokenized stocks by 2026 Knowpia enables tokenization ahead of Wall Street . And 2026 could see further acceleration to this adoption . CNBC reports stock tokenization running on the ETH network To visualize the true upsides of stock tokenization the economists of Deutsche Bank offered some great insights on Tokenization below . So far 90 % of tokenized assets are stable coin which ETH dominates and the tokenization of stocks could really invite traffic to the ETH network So why have BTC and ETH traded like hot garbage into year end Since late October the stock market has been choppy rather than trending . Volatility stayed elevated and trend signals weakened which caused systematic investors like CTAs and voltargeting funds to reduce exposure . In this environment BTC and ETH sold off during equity drawdowns but failed to rally on rebounds not_because of panic but because risk appetite never_fully returned . Positioning stayed light and investors remained cautious . So this looks more like a pause than a breakdown . The stock market has stabilized and pushed to new highs into yearend which suggests sentiment is still intact . Most notably the AI sector has remained strong . Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom were outstanding showing that growth expectations have not_collapsed . As equity volatility compresses and riskon sentiment improves this gives the market room to grind higher . If that happens liquidity and positioning should rotate back into highbeta assets which is bullish for BTC and ETH heading into early 2026 . Looking at the ETH chart the day candle is showing stabilization and I don ’ t see why it wouldn ’ t revisit ATH and break above $ 5250 in Q1 2026 . My expression for this bet BMNR I bought deep ITM BMNU calls so my breakeven is 0.4 % at the time of purchase As I think ETH could revisit 5k in Q1 2026 BMNR is the perfect pick . I pick it for 3 reasons 1 . No_debt so its much less of a fraud such as MSTR which is also starting to price in not_being included into SP 500 . 2 . Premium to NAV expansion if my thesis plays out Tom Lee will look like a genius again premium to NAV can revisit higher levels 1.3x 1.5x which is why I picked BMNR over SBET because people give leaders a premium in the treasury holding company world . 3 . I think we are close to a reversal given crypto already being in a bear market with greed and fear recently being in extreme fear . for reasons I mentioned earlier the ETH network is doing great far from a bear market so the price being in a bear market zone is really just a gift . Position I even bought for my TFSA"

      "selftext": "I'm currently investing in a Trading 212 Stocks ISA and likely to be able to max out for the next 6 years (£16k/year in Stocks ISA and £4k/year in Lifetime ISA). My current portfolio is at £34k: 66.9% VUAG at £22.8k 30.3% VWRP at £10.3k 2.7% Nvidia at £944 (not adding more) Going forward, I plan on just investing in VWRP. However, I keep seeing the argument from some finance creators (e.g. The FBA Investor) that \"ETFs won't make you rich\" and that with enough due diligence you can get higher long-term returns by concentrating into a smaller basket of individual stocks (holding for at least 5+ years). The criticism is that broad ETFs dilute exposure to the biggest winners and include many average companies which average to smaller returns. I understand the upside, but my concern is the probability of actually outperforming a simple global index over 10-30 years (and the risk of underperforming for long periods). 1. Is concentration in individual stocks a sensible way to optimise long-term returns? 2. Is my VUAG & VWRP split redundant - is it best to simplify to only VWRP? 3. Is a satellite approach reasonable and what percentage cap would you suggest for individual stocks (i.e. 10%)? I still plan to invest long-term by holding for at least 5 years.",

My current portfolio is at £34k 66.9 % VUAG at £22.8k 30.3 % VWRP at £10.3k 2.7 % Nvidia at £944 not adding more Going forward I plan on just investing in VWRP . However I keep seeing the argument from some finance creators e.g . The FBA Investor that ETFs wont make you rich and that with enough due diligence you can get higher longterm returns by concentrating into a smaller basket of individual stocks holding for at least 5 years . The criticism is that broad ETFs dilute exposure to the biggest winners and include many average companies which average to smaller returns . I understand the upside but my concern is the probability of actually outperforming a simple global index over 1030 years and the risk of underperforming for long periods . 1 . Is concentration in individual stocks a sensible way to optimise longterm returns 2 . Is my VUAG VWRP split redundant is it best to simplify to only VWRP 3 . Is a satellite approach reasonable and what percentage cap would you suggest for individual stocks i.e . 10 % I still plan to invest longterm by holding for at least 5 years ."

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas. Happy boxing day. Previously on Part 1 and 2 I showed how the bull market is supported by robust money market dry powder. However historically low savings rate and yield curve inversion snapback means cracks are starting to show. In part 3, I give the play to hedge a potential downturn. The market is currently treating Consumer Staples (XLP) like toxic waste because \"Risk-On\" is the only game in town. XLP RSI is hovering near 40 in late 2025. MACD is bearish. Nobody wants boring dividend stocks when tech is ripping. It has been dead money in 2025. What this means is we are getting a discount on insurance. If the savings rate reality hits consumption and consumers can no longer finance their consumptions, likely in the next Retail Sales print, the narrative will flip from \"Soft Landing\" to \"Recession Scare.\" I content accumulating Consumer Staples (XLP) is a wise move in the current climate. If the Soft Landing happens, XLP is fine (people still buy toothpaste). If the Hard Landing happens (indicated by the Yield Curve un-inversion and Savings Rate collapse), XLP outperforms massively as capital flees to safety. Position: I'm buying in the $78-$80 range for XLP. The Bottom Line: The consumer isn't dead, but they are exhausted. The market is pricing in a marathon runner; the data shows a sprinter gasping for air. Position accordingly. Part 1: Part 2:",

However historically low savings rate and yield curve inversion snapback means cracks are starting to show . In part 3 I give the play to hedge a potential downturn . The market is currently treating Consumer Staples XLP like toxic waste because RiskOn is the only game in town . XLP RSI is hovering near 40 in late 2025 . MACD is bearish . Nobody_wants boring dividend stocks when tech is ripping . It has been dead money in 2025 . What this means is we are getting a discount on insurance . If the savings rate reality hits consumption and consumers can no_longer finance their consumptions likely in the next Retail Sales print the narrative will flip from Soft Landing to Recession Scare . I content accumulating Consumer Staples XLP is a wise move in the current climate . If the Soft Landing happens XLP is fine people still buy toothpaste . If the Hard Landing happens indicated by the Yield Curve uninversion and Savings Rate collapse XLP outperforms massively as capital flees to safety . Position Im buying in the $ 78 $ 80 range for XLP . The Bottom Line The consumer isnt dead but they are exhausted . The market is pricing in a marathon runner the data shows a sprinter gasping for air . Position accordingly . Part 1 Part 2"

      "title": "The AI trade isn’t dying but the bottleneck may have quietly moved elsewhere",
      "selftext": "Over the last two years, AI has become *the* dominant investment narrative. Semiconductors, AI infrastructure, data centers the entire stack has attracted massive capital flows. Names like NVDA, TSM, and ASML turned into consensus longs, and for good reason: real revenue growth, real demand, real earnings power. But lately, I’ve been wondering whether the core constraint in this trade is still compute… or whether it has shifted to something far less exciting: **energy and grid infrastructure**. The scale of current AI investment plans is unprecedented. We’re no longer talking about incremental capex, but **$100B+ data center buildouts**, measured not just in dollars, but in *gigawatts*. At that level, chips are no longer the only bottleneck. Power availability, grid stability, and energy costs start to matter just as much. What’s interesting is that markets may already be reflecting this shift under the surface. AI hardware names have shown increasing volatility and sharp pullbacks after extended runs, while **utilities and power-related companies** have begun to quietly outperform. It’s not flashy, but it’s consistent with a market that’s starting to price the *next constraint* in the system. You can even see hints of this in trading behavior. On **Bitget** platforms , where both AI-heavy equities and energy-related names are actively traded in tokenized form, flows have become noticeably more two-sided. Instead of one-way momentum into AI, there’s growing interest in power generation, grid operators, and infrastructure-linked plays. This doesn’t mean the AI story is over. Far from it. AI adoption still looks structural, and companies like NVDA or TSM remain central beneficiaries over the long term. But markets don’t price stories in isolation they price constraints, risks, and second-order effects. And if energy and infrastructure become the limiting factors for AI expansion, capital allocation may gradually reflect that reality. So the question for long-term investors isn’t “AI or no AI,” but something more nuanced: * Do you stay heavily concentrated in AI infrastructure? * Do you start allocating toward utilities, power grids, and energy reliability? * Or do you balance both, accepting lower upside in exchange for resilience? Curious how others here are thinking about this shift, especially from a multi-year allocation perspective.",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the last two years AI has become the dominant investment narrative . Semiconductors AI infrastructure data centers the entire stack has attracted massive capital flows . Names like NVDA TSM and ASML turned into consensus longs and for good reason real revenue growth real demand real earnings power . But lately I ’ ve been wondering whether the core constraint in this trade is still compute… or whether it has shifted to something far less exciting energy and grid infrastructure . The scale of current AI investment plans is unprecedented . We ’ re no_longer talking about incremental capex but $ 100B data center buildouts measured not_just in dollars but in gigawatts . At that level chips are no_longer the only bottleneck . Power availability grid stability and energy costs start to matter just as much . What ’ s interesting is that markets may already be reflecting this shift under the surface . AI hardware names have shown increasing volatility and sharp pullbacks after extended runs while utilities and powerrelated companies have begun to quietly outperform . It ’ s not_flashy but it ’ s consistent with a market that ’ s starting to price the next constraint in the system . You can even see hints of this in trading behavior . On Bitget platforms where both AIheavy equities and energyrelated names are actively traded in tokenized form flows have become noticeably more twosided . Instead of oneway momentum into AI there ’ s growing interest in power generation grid operators and infrastructurelinked plays . This doesn ’ t mean the AI story is over . Far from it . AI adoption still looks structural and companies like NVDA or TSM remain central beneficiaries over the long term . But markets don ’ t price stories in isolation they price constraints risks and secondorder effects . And if energy and infrastructure become the limiting factors for AI expansion capital allocation may gradually reflect that reality . So the question for longterm investors isn ’ t “ AI or no_AI ” but something more nuanced Do you stay heavily concentrated in AI infrastructure Do you start allocating toward utilities power grids and energy reliability Or do you balance both accepting lower upside in exchange for resilience Curious how others here are thinking about this shift especially from a multiyear allocation perspective ."

      "selftext": "I work in fintech/banking in Central Asia and have been modeling a macro-structure for a unified economic zone (similar to the early EU or ASEAN) to solve the region's liquidity and logistic fragmentation. I want to stress-test this model from an **institutional investor's perspective**. If a jurisdiction adopted this framework, would it attract long-term capital, or are the structural risks still too high? **The Investment Thesis:** The region is currently undervalued due to political risk and fragmented borders. The proposed \"Federal\" model aims to derisk the environment for Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) through four specific mechanisms. # 1. De-risking Governance (Political Stability) * **Problem:** Investors fear regime change and expropriation (the \"Strongman\" risk). * **Solution:** A rigid constitutional lock (40 years) on property rights. * **Mechanism:** Executive power is hedged by a Bicameral Legislature where the Upper House represents national interests (Open List PR), preventing any single clan from capturing the state. A mandatory Run-off system forces centrist coalitions, reducing the risk of radical policy swings (e.g., sudden nationalization). # 2. Monetary Predictability[[1]( * **The Fed Model:** An independent Central Bank with a **Dual Mandate** (Price Stability + Employment). * **Currency:** A unified currency backed by a basket of commodities (Gold/Uranium reserves) to prevent FX volatility for foreign investors. * **Banking:** Implementation of **Glass-Steagall** separation. Commercial banks focus on lending to the real sector (CAPEX), minimizing systemic risk from speculative bubbles. Adoption of ISO 20022 standards for seamless cross-border settlement. # 3. Solving the \"Labor Shortage\" Risk (Human Capital) Developed markets (Korea, Japan) are facing demographic collapse, shrinking their consumer base. This model aims to create a sustainable labor pool. * **Demand-Side Stimulus:** State-backed infrastructure projects (High-speed rail, Logistics) ensure full employment. * **Wage Floor via Sectoral Bargaining:** Instead of a race-to-the-bottom, higher wages are encouraged to build a **robust middle class** capable of consuming imported goods and services. * **Result:** A growing demographic dividend (average age \\~28) with increasing purchasing power, contrasting with aging East Asian markets. # 4. Infrastructure as an Asset Class * The State acts as the primary developer of the \"Dry Suez\" logistics corridors connecting China and Europe. * This lowers logistics costs for private businesses entering the market. **The Question for** r/investing**:** From a risk/reward perspective, does this institutional setup (Checks and Balances + Demand-Side Stimulus) make the region a viable target for institutional capital? Or does the heavy state involvement in infrastructure crowd out private investment too much?",

      "selftext_processed": "I work in fintechbanking in Central Asia and have been modeling a macrostructure for a unified economic zone similar to the early EU or ASEAN to solve the regions liquidity and logistic fragmentation . I want to stresstest this model from an institutional investors perspective . If a jurisdiction adopted this framework would it attract longterm capital or are the structural risks still too high The Investment Thesis The region is currently undervalued due to political risk and fragmented borders . The proposed Federal model aims to derisk the environment for Foreign Direct Investment FDI through four specific mechanisms . 1 . Derisking Governance Political Stability Problem Investors fear regime change and expropriation the Strongman risk . Solution A rigid constitutional lock 40 years on property rights . Mechanism Executive power is hedged by a Bicameral Legislature where the Upper House represents national interests Open List PR preventing any single clan from capturing the state . A mandatory Runoff system forces centrist coalitions reducing the risk of radical policy swings e.g . sudden nationalization . 2 . Monetary Predictability1 The Fed Model An independent Central Bank with a Dual Mandate Price Stability Employment . Currency A unified currency backed by a basket of commodities GoldUranium reserves to prevent FX volatility for foreign investors . Banking Implementation of GlassSteagall separation . Commercial banks focus on lending to the real sector CAPEX minimizing systemic risk from speculative bubbles . Adoption of ISO 20022 standards for seamless crossborder settlement . 3 . Solving the Labor Shortage Risk Human Capital Developed markets Korea Japan are facing demographic collapse shrinking their consumer base . This model aims to create a sustainable labor pool . DemandSide Stimulus Statebacked infrastructure projects Highspeed rail Logistics ensure full employment . Wage Floor via Sectoral Bargaining Instead of a racetothebottom higher wages are encouraged to build a robust middle class capable of consuming imported goods and services . Result A growing demographic dividend average age 28 with increasing purchasing power contrasting with aging East Asian markets . 4 . Infrastructure as an Asset Class The State acts as the primary developer of the Dry Suez logistics corridors connecting China and Europe . This lowers logistics costs for private businesses entering the market . The Question for rinvesting From a riskreward perspective does this institutional setup Checks and Balances DemandSide Stimulus make the region a viable target for institutional capital Or does the heavy state involvement in infrastructure crowd out private investment too much"

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas: On part 1 you read how the current market is held up by flush consumer cash and money market. Part 2 you will see how it is more fragile than you think. Saving rates collapse: The K-Shaped recovery is turning into a K-Shaped exhaustion. ​Personal Saving Rate has fallen to 4.7% as of September 2025, with the 2025 year-to-date average sitting even lower at 4.4%. This is historically dangerous territory. In the 1970s, this rate averaged 11.7%. We are currently saving at less than half the rate of previous generations. ​Consumers are maintaining their lifestyle (retail sales growth) not by earning more, but by saving less. This is mathematically unsustainable. When the savings rate hits 0%, spending must contract. ​Credit Stress: While the aggregate credit card delinquency rate is ~3.0% (Sept 2025), specific pockets are flashing red. Serious delinquency rates in low-income zip codes have surged past 20% in 2025, a level of stress comparable to the 2008 crisis for that specific demographic. The bottom 50% of earners have burned through their pandemic savings and are now maxing out leverage to survive inflation. The \"average\" is fine, but the foundation is rotting. ​The Yield Curve Signal (10Y-2Y Spread): ​The 10Y-2Y Treasury spread is now positive, sitting at +0.68% as of December 19, 2025 (10Y at 4.16%, 2Y at 3.48%). ​The curve was inverted (negative) continuously from July 2022 to August 2024. ​ Historically, the recession doesn't start when the curve inverts; it starts when it un-inverts (snaps back to positive) as the market demands Fed cuts. We are currently in that \"snap back\" danger zone. We are in a bull market. However this bull is exhausted. It is a porcelain bull. Fragile. Part 1: Part 2: Part 3:",

      "selftext": "Merry Christmas. I’ve spent the last days in the office hiding from my family pulling specific data points from FRED (debt service, savings rates, yield curves) to stress-test the \"Soft Landing\" narrative. We are essentially in a \"Wile E. Coyote\" moment running off the cliff, but gravity hasn't kicked in yet because the momentum is so strong. Why the Crash Hasn't Happened: As of Q2 2025, the Household Debt Service Ratio sits at 11.2% of disposable income. This is historically low. For comparison, this ratio peaked at nearly 16% in late 2007 right before the Great Financial Crisis. Even during the \"normal\" years of 2010–2019, it averaged 12.1%. Despite the Fed raising rates, the average American is spending less of their income on debt payments today than they did a decade ago. This \"shield\" explains why higher rates haven't crushed consumption yet. Total Money Market Fund assets hit a record $7.67 Trillion for the week ending December 17, 2025. This is up 13.2% from one year ago ($6.77T). This is massive dry powder. Every time the market dips, this cash steps in to buy, creating a valuation floor that prevents a full capitulation.

I ’ ve spent the last days in the office hiding from my family pulling specific data points from FRED debt service savings rates yield curves to stresstest the Soft Landing narrative . We are essentially in a Wile E. Coyote moment running off the cliff but gravity hasnt kicked in yet because the momentum is so strong . Why the Crash Hasnt Happened As of Q2 2025 the Household Debt Service Ratio sits at 11.2 % of disposable income . This is historically low . For comparison this ratio peaked at nearly 16 % in late 2007 right before the Great Financial Crisis . Even during the normal years of 2010–2019 it averaged 12.1 % . Despite the Fed raising rates the average American is spending less of their income on debt payments today than they did a decade ago . This shield explains why higher rates havent crushed consumption yet . Total Money Market Fund assets hit a record $ 7.67 Trillion for the week ending December 17 2025 . This is up 13.2 % from one year ago $ 6.77T . This is massive dry powder . Every time the market dips this cash steps in to buy creating a valuation floor that prevents a full capitulation . Part 2 why the market is fragile"

      "selftext": "I feel like we're in for an incredibly volatile month in January. There are two major events that could have a huge impact on the market - Supreme Court ruling on IEEPA tariffs, and a potential second gov shutdown at the end of the month. I think the latter is much less likely to happen than the former. I mostly want to talk about the tariff situation. I feel like nobody is really talking about this and we are just kind of sleep walking into it... To be fair it is hard to predict how the market will react to the news and what will happen next. It seems very likely that the SC will rule against Trump here though. This will force the government to refund a massive amount of money, and will produce a lot of chaos and uncertainty. While it may seem bullish on paper for tariffs to be struck down, the reality is that Trump will find another avenue to proceed with. The net effect of this ruling would be that we essentially go back to square 1. We have to refund an enormous amount of money, and clarity on tariff policy just gets delayed even further. I think this is a situation where SC will rule against it because it isn't legal, but it is probably not in the best interest of your average citizen for them to do so. I say this not because I believe in tariffs, I'm saying this because I feel the chaos that will ensue is going to be detrimental to the country at the end of the day. But thats beside the point. I'm mostly interested in how you guys think markets will react. I don't see this as a particularly bullish event even though it may seem that way. Again I think the actual effect of this decision will be greater lack of clarity on policy, and this is not a positive for markets or the economy. There might be specific winners and losers that you can pick out, interested to hear your thoughts. I think this should be a bigger concern than it is. I feel like nobody is talking about this right now and I think it could move the market pretty significantly. I think January is going to be a VERY volatile month.",

Now, if there is no noncontrolling interest(meaning every subsidiary of company A is 100% owned by company A), it means 100% of operating income of company A belongs to shareholders that hold company A's stock. Let's say that 30% of company A's subsidiaries are owned by noncontrolling interest. Now does that mean that when company A generates operating income, only 70% belongs to shareholders that hold company A's stock? Then why is it that on [SEC.GOV]( financial reports don't divide operation income into two portions(one that belongs to controlling interest and the other that belongs to noncontrolling interest)?",

Terrible investments, I know, but I've since learned about actual, more meaningful investments, so now I do a Roth IRA and HSA.

Will I pay taxes on funds that were ultimately a loss on my end? And if so, how do I go about filing and paying those taxes?

Leaving it in MM and playing the wait and see with the economy. (a major drop in the stock market being an opportunity to buy) Any advice would be appreciated.

I am considering the following 1 . Putting the majority of the MM account into index funds over time DCA . 2 . Leave half in MM and put half into diverse investment portfolio . 3 . Leaving it in MM and playing the wait and see with the economy . a major drop in the stock market being an opportunity to buy Any advice would be appreciated .

      "selftext": "Not kidding, the trading day after Christmas is historically the best day of the year. This year it is the 2nd day of the Santa Claus rally (as defined). I’m thinking this may be an especially bullish day. Why? The S&P 500 is less than 1% from hitting the 7,000 milestone. I think a lot of people would like to see this benchmark hit and even better if it were to close above 7,000. Every other day in the Santa Claus rally is a mixed bag, we even have plenty of >1% drops during those days. I think if the bulls want to make a move and a statement then this Friday is it. UPDATE: For more context I found this article: [ Day after Christmas has an average +0.5% gain with only six sessions since 1953 going red.",

I ’ m thinking this may be an especially bullish day . Why The SP 500 is less than 1 % from hitting the 7000 milestone . I think a lot of people would like to see this benchmark hit and even better if it were to close above 7000 . Every other day in the Santa Claus rally is a mixed bag we even have plenty of 1 % drops during those days . I think if the bulls want to make a move and a statement then this Friday is it . UPDATE For more context I found this article Day after Christmas has an average 0.5 % gain with only six sessions since 1953 going red ."

      "selftext": "Various signs indicate that the artificial intelligence boom is not only showing no signs of cooling but is accelerating. Six stocks will lead the global $1 trillion chip surge in 2026, even as some AI skeptics remain on the sidelines due to perceived overvaluation. However, this industry is currently only in the middle phase of a decade long transformation process, with NVDA and AVGO as the dominant players. Global semiconductor sales are projected to surge 30% year over year in 2026, surpassing the historic $1 trillion annual sales threshold for the first time. I believe that if this is the case, we should focus on companies with “moats that can be quantified from their profit structures.” Beyond NVDA and AVGO, are the other four major semiconductor companies also worth attention: LRCX、KLAC、ADI and CDNS. They dominate their respective markets, holding market shares generally between 70% and 75%. Bank of America estimates that by 2030, the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $1.2 trillion, growing at a CAGR of 38%. AI accelerators alone represent a $900 billion market opportunity. Despite these staggering figures, the market remains cautious due to the exorbitant costs of building AI data centers. A typical 1 gigawatt data center requires capital expenditures of around $60 billion, with roughly half allocated to hardware, Bank of America notes. This raises a critical question: Will these investments truly yield returns? Personally, I remain optimistic. Current spending is both “offensive” and “defensive.” In other words, large tech companies have no choice but to invest to defend their empires. NVDA stock has risen over 40% year to date. Perhaps we can no longer compare this AI giant to traditional chipmakers: the average price of a standard chip is $2.40, while Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) sell for around $30,000. Despite some market concerns that Nvidia's market cap may have peaked, Bank of America points out that the company is projected to generate $500 billion in free cash flow over the next three years, making its growth adjusted valuation “still extremely attractive.” NVDA current price to earnings growth ratio (PEG ratio, calculated as P/E ÷ earnings growth rate to assess whether a company's current stock price is reasonable relative to future earnings growth) stands at approximately 0.6x. By comparison, the S&P 500 index's PEG ratio approaches 2x. From a valuation perspective, NVDA appears quite attractive“valuation depends on the observer's perspective.” If Nvidia is the brain of AI, then Broadcom is its nervous system. AVGO stock has surged over 50% this year as the company has transformed from a component supplier into a pillar of AI infrastructure, now valued at $1.6 trillion. Its rise stems from custom built application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for hyperscale companies like Google and Meta. As these tech giants seek to reduce reliance on Nvidia, they are increasingly turning to Broadcom. But the road to a trillion dollar valuation will be “bumpy,” and no stock is “risk free.” So how should investors navigate AI and tech investments in 2026? What are your thoughts? Should we continue holding long term or...?",

      "selftext_processed": "Various signs indicate that the artificial intelligence boom is not_only showing no_signs of cooling but is accelerating . Six stocks will lead the global $ 1 trillion chip surge in 2026 even as some AI skeptics remain on the sidelines due to perceived overvaluation . However this industry is currently only in the middle phase of a decade long transformation process with NVDA and AVGO as the dominant players . Global semiconductor sales are projected to surge 30 % year over year in 2026 surpassing the historic $ 1 trillion annual sales threshold for the first time . I believe that if this is the case we should focus on companies with “ moats that can be quantified from their profit structures. ” Beyond NVDA and AVGO are the other four major semiconductor companies also worth attention LRCX、KLAC、ADI and CDNS . They dominate their respective markets holding market shares generally between 70 % and 75 % . Bank of America estimates that by 2030 the total addressable market for AI data center systems will exceed $ 1.2 trillion growing at a CAGR of 38 % . AI accelerators alone represent a $ 900 billion market opportunity . Despite these staggering figures the market remains cautious due to the exorbitant costs of building AI data centers . A typical 1 gigawatt data center requires capital expenditures of around $ 60 billion with roughly half allocated to hardware Bank of America notes . This raises a critical question Will these investments truly yield returns Personally I remain optimistic . Current spending is both “ offensive ” and “ defensive. ” In other words large tech companies have no_choice but to invest to defend their empires . NVDA stock has risen over 40 % year to date . Perhaps we can no_longer compare this AI giant to traditional chipmakers the average price of a standard chip is $ 2.40 while Nvidias graphics processing units GPUs sell for around $ 30000 . Despite some market concerns that Nvidias market cap may have peaked Bank of America points out that the company is projected to generate $ 500 billion in free cash flow over the next three years making its growth adjusted valuation “ still extremely attractive. ” NVDA current price to earnings growth ratio PEG ratio calculated as PE ÷ earnings growth rate to assess whether a companys current stock price is reasonable relative to future earnings growth stands at approximately 0.6x . By comparison the SP 500 indexs PEG ratio approaches 2x . From a valuation perspective NVDA appears quite attractive “ valuation depends on the observers perspective. ” If Nvidia is the brain of AI then Broadcom is its nervous system . AVGO stock has surged over 50 % this year as the company has transformed from a component supplier into a pillar of AI infrastructure now valued at $ 1.6 trillion . Its rise stems from custom built application specific integrated circuits ASICs for hyperscale companies like Google and Meta . As these tech giants seek to reduce reliance on Nvidia they are increasingly turning to Broadcom . But the road to a trillion dollar valuation will be “ bumpy ” and no_stock is “ risk free. ” So how should investors navigate AI and tech investments in 2026 What are your thoughts Should we continue holding long term or ..."

      "selftext": "Gold and silver reached a new record high, and spot silver historically stood at 70 USD/ounce on Tuesday evening - far higher than the price per barrel of crude oil. The signal sent by the market seems to be very clear: in order to avoid the risk of depreciation of the legal currency, investors are investing in assets that are not controlled by any central bank or government. Assets that are not currently participating in the rise are also worthy of attention: such as \"digital gold\". In most of the cheap currency era after 2008, they succeeded in profiting from currency devaluation transactions. But now, the deal seems to have entered a new and possibly riskier stage, and traders have begun to turn to the original human risk-averse tool in the crisis. This phenomenon is quite meaningful: in the face of the choice of human creations such as legal currency and ancient natural value storage tools such as gold and silver, investors choose to trust the latter. If the currency continues to depreciate relative to gold, this impact will eventually be transmitted to other commodities such as industrial metals, and then enter the economic supply chain. Inflation may worsen, government bonds may fall, pushing up interest rates, and eventually causing market panic. In the past month alone, interest rates on long-term debt in most developed countries have risen by 0.15%-0.25%, which is clearly not a vote of confidence in the currency. The stability of the modern economy depends on the public's trust in the value of the monetary system, which cannot be overemphasized. Nowadays, this trust is gradually being shaken. Although they have not yet fallen into a crisis, central banks have been warned that if they remain sacent when gold and silver are soaring, the market may abandon them. It is worth noting that the last time the price of silver was so higher than that of crude oil was in the early 1980s. What was followed by vicious inflation, soaring interest rates, market collapse and economic recession. This future is not destined to come, but a similar financial crisis has now become a very realistic possibility. Will history come again? Should we choose to retreat from the rapids or move forward bravely? Why?",

      "selftext_processed": "Gold and silver reached a new record high and spot silver historically stood at 70 USDounce on Tuesday evening far higher than the price per barrel of crude oil . The signal sent by the market seems to be very clear in order to avoid the risk of depreciation of the legal currency investors are investing in assets that are not_controlled by any central bank or government . Assets that are not_currently participating in the rise are also worthy of attention such as digital gold . In most of the cheap currency era after 2008 they succeeded in profiting from currency devaluation transactions . But now the deal seems to have entered a new and possibly riskier stage and traders have begun to turn to the original human riskaverse tool in the crisis . This phenomenon is quite meaningful in the face of the choice of human creations such as legal currency and ancient natural value storage tools such as gold and silver investors choose to trust the latter . If the currency continues to depreciate relative to gold this impact will eventually be transmitted to other commodities such as industrial metals and then enter the economic supply chain . Inflation may worsen government bonds may fall pushing up interest rates and eventually causing market panic . In the past month alone interest rates on longterm debt in most developed countries have risen by 0.15 % 0.25 % which is clearly not_a vote of confidence in the currency . The stability of the modern economy depends on the publics trust in the value of the monetary system which can not be overemphasized . Nowadays this trust is gradually being shaken . Although they have not_yet fallen into a crisis central banks have been warned that if they remain sacent when gold and silver are soaring the market may abandon them . It is worth noting that the last time the price of silver was so higher than that of crude oil was in the early 1980s . What was followed by vicious inflation soaring interest rates market collapse and economic recession . This future is not_destined to come but a similar financial crisis has now become a very realistic possibility . Will history come again Should we choose to retreat from the rapids or move forward bravely Why"

      "selftext": "So, my market of choice (corporate bonds on amx exchange) is not very liquid, but has designated market makers who are obliged to submit daily quotations. For example, most traded amd security last month is [AMAMRBBN2ER0]( stunning 17 trades in a month! And a whole 50 trades in last year. But the bid, ask and spread are pretty uniform and you are guaranteed to buy/sell your bonds at fair-ish price (maximum spread is 5% by law, e.g. if the ask yield is 8%, then bid yield shall not exceed 8.4%). Basically, most of the time I (and other investors) just accept marketmaker's bid/ask price and trade at their conditions. However, I recently experimented with limit orders slightly above marketmaker's bid and below their ask. Well, it needs at least a couple of days to work, but they do eventually fill. But I have a question here: when the trading is mostly sporadic, how do I calculate opportunity cost here? Like, let's say I want to buy abovementioned AMRBBN2 on 24.12: I can guaranteed buy it today for 100.4377 (8.9049% ytm), or I can place an order for around 100.205 (about 9.35% ytm) and wait god knows how long for it. How can I try to predict, will the wait worth the difference in price? Are there some standard practices and approaches for illiquid markets, and what can I read about how it usually works in theory? I'm not sure if this could be timed, but if it could, how do I analyse when it's the best days to trade?",

      "selftext_processed": "So my market of choice corporate bonds on amx exchange is not_very liquid but has designated market makers who are obliged to submit daily quotations . For example most traded amd security last month is AMAMRBBN2ER0 stunning 17 trades in a month And a whole 50 trades in last year . But the bid ask and spread are pretty uniform and you are guaranteed to buysell your bonds at fairish price maximum spread is 5 % by law e.g . if the ask yield is 8 % then bid yield shall not_exceed 8.4 % . Basically most of the time I and other investors just accept marketmakers bidask price and trade at their conditions . However I recently experimented with limit orders slightly above marketmakers bid and below their ask . Well it needs at least a couple of days to work but they do eventually fill . But I have a question here when the trading is mostly sporadic how do I calculate opportunity cost here Like lets say I want to buy abovementioned AMRBBN2 on 24.12 I can guaranteed buy it today for 100.4377 8.9049 % ytm or I can place an order for around 100.205 about 9.35 % ytm and wait god knows how long for it . How can I try to predict will the wait worth the difference in price Are there some standard practices and approaches for illiquid markets and what can I read about how it usually works in theory Im not_sure if this could be timed but if it could how do I analyse when its the best days to trade"

      "selftext": "This is the story of a foreign investor who likes to read a lot, especially World and US news and documentaries, whose luck has been a bit different. I tried investing in the US stock market for the first time in late 2008 and early 2009. Unfortunately, I did not have access to the US stock market or a brokerage firm, and most importantly, I was only 25 years old and had little to no money saved for investing. My gut feeling told me that this was the time to start investing, even before the expression \"buy the dip\" existed. I tried to convince my parents, especially my mom, that there was no way in hell that the US stock market would crash forever, that a bailout was coming for AIG and Bank of America. That if banks in my home country had been bailed out before in 1999, it would obviously happen in the US too. That the US had a big unlimited printer and whatever happened they would print their way out of it. My home country during 2007 to 2009 had a bonanza period, so the Great Depression was not felt as badly as it was in other parts of the world. Plus, people still had the bank run of 1999 very present in their minds. So investing in the US stock market seemed awfully risky. I was not able to convince them. My big chance to invest, not even my money, was gone by 2010. I stopped thinking about investing in the US stock market for many years. Until 2020 hit. COVID 19 arrived and the world seemed to be coming to an end, the market started to dip abruptly. This was my time to invest, I thought. The world would not end with a virus. If it did, there was no reason to have savings stored somewhere. If the world came back as resilient as it is, I would be making good money. I was 36 years old, had some savings this time, but I still had no access to the US stock market. I desperately tried to open a brokerage account as soon as the market plunged. It was now or never, I thought. I tried one company, no luck, then another one, same result. I was not even able to open a bank account from abroad. The market had already crashed and was rapidly going up again. I traveled to the US as soon as flights started opening internationally for tourism. One of my first stops was a brokerage firm in Miami. I opened my account and felt I had finally gained access to the door of wealth creation, freedom, and liberty. I then had to return to my home country to transfer money abroad. Unfortunately, I lost some more time because I had to pay a currency exit tax of 5 percent, which made me doubt whether it was still worth it. The market had almost recovered from its crash. Certificates of deposit in my home country paid about 6 percent annually. That meant losing a relatively safe investment and the interest earned over a year. I made calculation after calculation. Lump sum beats DCA. Time in the market beats timing the market. ETFs are safer than single equities. I learned how NRAs, dividends, cash, reinvested, qualified, taxes, shorts, calls, and puts work. I paid the currency exit tax and finally entered the market. I finally started investing in late September 2021. A couple of months later, the market crashed about 21 percent. I was extremely mad at myself. I had invested at an all time high. I knew interest rate hikes by the Fed would affect the market, but I was not sure how. People could start selling since the \"free money\" period was over, or they could rush into the stock market since with high inflation it could perform better than other assets. Seeing my investment plunge 21 percent was not easy. Again, I basically forgot about the stock market for a couple of years. Fast forward to April 2024. My home country was in political turmoil. CDs no longer felt safe. I could lose all of it in a heartbeat if a populist, communist socialist government came into power. Plus, the currency exit tax had temporarily decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent. I decided to transfer six figures from my home country to my dormant brokerage account. I had checked my portfolio after many years, from 2022 to mid 2024, my portfolio had increased about 7 percent, which meant I had made roughly 1 percent more than if I had left that money in a CD. That made me feel a bit better. I did not act swiftly with the newly transferred six figures, and this is what I regret a lot, especially considering the bull run that has followed. Since I was psychologically hit by the 2022 crash, and because there is always someone somewhere saying that the next crash is imminent, I turned to Treasury investments. They paid a \"safe\" 4 to 4.5 percent, which was historically high according to my research, and were considered the safest investment possible. I invested all of it in T bills paying about 4.5 percent, and a bit in notes that paid periodic interest. I learned how to calculate yields and expiration values. It felt good, but at the same time I felt I was missing the current bull run. My money was frozen for 30, 45, or 100 days at a time. As soon as a bill or note expired, I purchased a new one. The market crash was imminent, I thought. Fast forward to October 29, 2025. I had about 300 thousand dollars in Treasury notes expiring that day. I analyzed the market. It had gone up, and by a lot. \"VOO and chill,\" I remembered reading many times in Reddit. VOO had only gone up during that period. Same with QQQ, VTI, and VT. Even international markets like the IBEX 35 had increased sharply compared to my modest 4 percent in Treasuries. I went all in on the stock market again on October 29, 2025. Lump sum, all of it. Plus some money in a company called NVDA, which a friend living in the US and working in the tech industry said promised high returns. I had bought my first NVDA shares in June 2024 at 128 dollars per share, we thought it was already too expensive back then. Now it is December 24, 2025, and the market has not yet recovered from its October 29 peak. Sometimes I wonder how I manage to invest exclusively at all time highs, or how I fail to invest when I know it is the right time. I have missed investing in two big crashes, 2008 and 2020, and invested twice before two big dips, 2022 and 2025. Now everyone is talking about an AI bubble, similar to the 2008 bubble. Is there really an AI bubble. And for those who do not know, recouping your wealth if you invested at the peak of 2008 took almost 10 years. I am not sure what to do now. Should I cash out. Wait a bit longer. Is there really an AI bubble. Will it burst soon. Perhaps I should add that I strongly believe that AI will change the world forever. That many, or the vast majority of jobs will be replaced by AI and robots. That work will become optional. That humanity will have to reinvent itself to understand income, work, meaning, and the purpose of life. Well, that is my true story.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the story of a foreign investor who likes to read a lot especially World and US news and documentaries whose luck has been a bit different . I tried investing in the US stock market for the first time in late 2008 and early 2009 . Unfortunately I did not_have access to the US stock market or a brokerage firm and most importantly I was only 25 years old and had little to no_money saved for investing . My gut feeling told me that this was the time to start investing even before the expression buy the dip existed . I tried to convince my parents especially my mom that there was no_way in hell that the US stock market would crash forever that a bailout was coming for AIG and Bank of America . That if banks in my home country had been bailed out before in 1999 it would obviously happen in the US too . That the US had a big unlimited printer and whatever happened they would print their way out of it . My home country during 2007 to 2009 had a bonanza period so the Great Depression was not_felt as badly as it was in other parts of the world . Plus people still had the bank run of 1999 very present in their minds . So investing in the US stock market seemed awfully risky . I was not_able to convince them . My big chance to invest not_even my money was gone by 2010 . I stopped thinking about investing in the US stock market for many years . Until 2020 hit . COVID 19 arrived and the world seemed to be coming to an end the market started to dip abruptly . This was my time to invest I thought . The world would not_end with a virus . If it did there was no_reason to have savings stored somewhere . If the world came back as resilient as it is I would be making good money . I was 36 years old had some savings this time but I still had no_access to the US stock market . I desperately tried to open a brokerage account as soon as the market plunged . It was now or never_I thought . I tried one company no_luck then another one same result . I was not_even able to open a bank account from abroad . The market had already crashed and was rapidly going up again . I traveled to the US as soon as flights started opening internationally for tourism . One of my first stops was a brokerage firm in Miami . I opened my account and felt I had finally gained access to the door of wealth creation freedom and liberty . I then had to return to my home country to transfer money abroad . Unfortunately I lost some more time because I had to pay a currency exit tax of 5 percent which made me doubt whether it was still worth it . The market had almost recovered from its crash . Certificates of deposit in my home country paid about 6 percent annually . That meant losing a relatively safe investment and the interest earned over a year . I made calculation after calculation . Lump sum beats DCA . Time in the market beats timing the market . ETFs are safer than single equities . I learned how NRAs dividends cash reinvested qualified taxes shorts calls and puts work . I paid the currency exit tax and finally entered the market . I finally started investing in late September 2021 . A couple of months later the market crashed about 21 percent . I was extremely mad at myself . I had invested at an all time high . I knew interest rate hikes by the Fed would affect the market but I was not_sure how . People could start selling since the free money period was over or they could rush into the stock market since with high inflation it could perform better than other assets . Seeing my investment plunge 21 percent was not_easy . Again I basically forgot about the stock market for a couple of years . Fast forward to April 2024 . My home country was in political turmoil . CDs no_longer felt safe . I could lose all of it in a heartbeat if a populist communist socialist government came into power . Plus the currency exit tax had temporarily decreased from 5 percent to 3 percent . I decided to transfer six figures from my home country to my dormant brokerage account . I had checked my portfolio after many years from 2022 to mid 2024 my portfolio had increased about 7 percent which meant I had made roughly 1 percent more than if I had left that money in a CD . That made me feel a bit better . I did not_act swiftly with the newly transferred six figures and this is what I regret a lot especially considering the bull run that has followed . Since I was psychologically hit by the 2022 crash and because there is always someone somewhere saying that the next crash is imminent I turned to Treasury investments . They paid a safe 4 to 4.5 percent which was historically high according to my research and were considered the safest investment possible . I invested all of it in T bills paying about 4.5 percent and a bit in notes that paid periodic interest . I learned how to calculate yields and expiration values . It felt good but at the same time I felt I was missing the current bull run . My money was frozen for 30 45 or 100 days at a time . As soon as a bill or note expired I purchased a new one . The market crash was imminent I thought . Fast forward to October 29 2025 . I had about 300 thousand dollars in Treasury notes expiring that day . I analyzed the market . It had gone up and by a lot . VOO and chill I remembered reading many times in Reddit . VOO had only gone up during that period . Same with QQQ VTI and VT . Even international markets like the IBEX 35 had increased sharply compared to my modest 4 percent in Treasuries . I went all in on the stock market again on October 29 2025 . Lump sum all of it . Plus some money in a company called NVDA which a friend living in the US and working in the tech industry said promised high returns . I had bought my first NVDA shares in June 2024 at 128 dollars per share we thought it was already too expensive back then . Now it is December 24 2025 and the market has not_yet recovered from its October 29 peak . Sometimes I wonder how I manage to invest exclusively at all time highs or how I fail to invest when I know it is the right time . I have missed investing in two big crashes 2008 and 2020 and invested twice before two big dips 2022 and 2025 . Now everyone is talking about an AI bubble similar to the 2008 bubble . Is there really an AI bubble . And for those who do not_know recouping your wealth if you invested at the peak of 2008 took almost 10 years . I am not_sure what to do now . Should I cash out . Wait a bit longer . Is there really an AI bubble . Will it burst soon . Perhaps I should add that I strongly believe that AI will change the world forever . That many or the vast majority of jobs will be replaced by AI and robots . That work will become optional . That humanity will have to reinvent itself to understand income work meaning and the purpose of life . Well that is my true story ."

      "selftext": "Stocks that experience continuous sharp increases are often short-term in nature. This is especially true for stocks that haven't undergone sufficient consolidation at the bottom but instead begin a rapid, continuous upward surge. Holding such stocks can lead to significant gains in a short period, but the key is whether you can cash out in time. It's important not to rush to sell before a top signal appears; you should ride the trend as long as possible. This point is crucial. Furthermore, this post emphasizes short-term, continuous sharp increases; long-term selling methods are not included here. To seize the best selling opportunity and successfully realize the profits from short-term surges, investors need to grasp the following three key points: First, determine the selling timing based on candlestick patterns. 1. When a stock experiences a continuous sharp increase, consider selling if signals such as a doji, inverted hammer, hanging man, high open with a large bearish candle, companion line, or a bearish engulfing pattern (covering 2/3 of the previous day's bullish candle body) appear. 2. Top reversal pattern. If this pattern appears, sell decisively. 3. Similar to a spinning top pattern. Sell. 4. Consider selling if the price fails to break above the previous high for two consecutive days or only symbolically breaks above it. 5. Selling when the price breaks below the rising support moving average is an option, but not the best timing. Second, determine the selling timing based on trading volume and price action. 1. Consider selling if there are continuous large buy orders but the price shows obvious signs of stagnation. 2. Consider selling if the intraday chart shows rapid upward movement followed by a sharp decline with high volume and excessive price fluctuations. 3. Consider selling if there is abnormally high volume and high turnover after a continuous upward surge (excluding breakout situations). 4. Consider selling if the stock opens significantly lower the next day after a continuous upward surge. 5. Consider selling if new hot sectors emerge and show overall strength. Third, determine the selling timing based on time cycles. In a strong market, the upward trend usually lasts a maximum of 7 days. While there are stocks that continue to rise for more than seven days, they are very rare, so don't bet on these exceptional cases. In a weak market, the upward trend typically lasts around three days. The most important thing in short-term trading is to avoid greed and to change direction promptly. For short-term trading experts, determining the best selling opportunity involves the one-line method, which means exiting based on the top signal of a single candlestick. Conservative investors can use the two-line method, but this method is often lagging; for investors who didn't manage to sell at the highest point, when the candlestick breaks through the support line, it's the last chance to salvage the situation. If this opportunity is missed, a continuous downward trend will follow, and it will be too late to cut losses, making losses and being trapped in the market inevitable. In short-term trading, don't rely too much on auxiliary indicators like MACD and KDJ, as their lagging nature can easily lead to missing the best opportunity. I'm curious how everyone handles stocks that are rising parabolically. What exit signals do you typically use?",

      "selftext_processed": "Stocks that experience continuous sharp increases are often shortterm in nature . This is especially true for stocks that havent undergone sufficient consolidation at the bottom but instead begin a rapid continuous upward surge . Holding such stocks can lead to significant gains in a short period but the key is whether you can cash out in time . Its important not_to rush to sell before a top signal appears you should ride the trend as long as possible . This point is crucial . Furthermore this post emphasizes shortterm continuous sharp increases longterm selling methods are not_included here . To seize the best selling opportunity and successfully realize the profits from shortterm surges investors need to grasp the following three key points First determine the selling timing based on candlestick patterns . 1 . When a stock experiences a continuous sharp increase consider selling if signals such as a doji inverted hammer hanging man high open with a large bearish candle companion line or a bearish engulfing pattern covering 23 of the previous days bullish candle body appear . 2 . Top reversal pattern . If this pattern appears sell decisively . 3 . Similar to a spinning top pattern . Sell . 4 . Consider selling if the price fails to break above the previous high for two consecutive days or only symbolically breaks above it . 5 . Selling when the price breaks below the rising support moving average is an option but not_the best timing . Second determine the selling timing based on trading volume and price action . 1 . Consider selling if there are continuous large buy orders but the price shows obvious signs of stagnation . 2 . Consider selling if the intraday chart shows rapid upward movement followed by a sharp decline with high volume and excessive price fluctuations . 3 . Consider selling if there is abnormally high volume and high turnover after a continuous upward surge excluding breakout situations . 4 . Consider selling if the stock opens significantly lower the next day after a continuous upward surge . 5 . Consider selling if new hot sectors emerge and show overall strength . Third determine the selling timing based on time cycles . In a strong market the upward trend usually lasts a maximum of 7 days . While there are stocks that continue to rise for more than seven days they are very rare so dont bet on these exceptional cases . In a weak market the upward trend typically lasts around three days . The most important thing in shortterm trading is to avoid greed and to change direction promptly . For shortterm trading experts determining the best selling opportunity involves the oneline method which means exiting based on the top signal of a single candlestick . Conservative investors can use the twoline method but this method is often lagging for investors who didnt manage to sell at the highest point when the candlestick breaks through the support line its the last chance to salvage the situation . If this opportunity is missed a continuous downward trend will follow and it will be too late to cut losses making losses and being trapped in the market inevitable . In shortterm trading dont rely too much on auxiliary indicators like MACD and KDJ as their lagging nature can easily lead to missing the best opportunity . Im curious how everyone handles stocks that are rising parabolically . What exit signals do you typically use"

This will force institutions that track the index (think passive mutual funds and ETFs) to buy shares of PATH. Rough math says that about 70 million shares will need to be bought. We're already seeing the stock pop pre-market on the news, but the real index buying probably won't happen until near market close December 31 (the last trading day before Jan 2nd) as funds add PATH to prepare for the inclusion in the index on Jan 2nd. But wait there's more...the latest short interest report shows that there's currently over 48 million shares sold short - that's 11% of the float, which is a pretty big amount. If those shorts don't close before the forced institutional index buying, this could cause a spicy short squeeze to kick off 2026.",

      "selftext": "I'm 47, investing for retirement in 20-25 years. I've been disciplined with my strategy: between 20 to 25k /year into broad market index funds (similar to VT/VEQT), split between retirement accounts. Recently, I've been feeling FOMO watching various sectors rally (space, commodities, mega-cap tech). My strategy has been working, but I'm tempted to allocate 5-8% into speculative plays like: Space sector ETFs or individual names Mega-cap tech that's \"lagging\" (thinking it'll catch up) Commodities riding recent momentum. My concern: Am I letting recency bias and FOMO drive me away from a solid long-term strategy? Questions for the community: For those 10+ years into index investing, have you successfully added speculative positions without derailing your plan? Is there merit to \"scratching the itch\" with a small allocation to stay disciplined on the core, or does it usually snowball? At what point does \"diversification into sectors\" become counterproductive stock-picking? Not looking for specific ticker advice, just perspective from experienced investors who've navigated this psychological challenge. Thanks",

      "selftext_processed": "Im 47 investing for retirement in 2025 years . Ive been disciplined with my strategy between 20 to 25k year into broad market index funds similar to VTVEQT split between retirement accounts . Recently Ive been feeling FOMO watching various sectors rally space commodities megacap tech . My strategy has been working but Im tempted to allocate 58 % into speculative plays like Space sector ETFs or individual names Megacap tech thats lagging thinking itll catch up Commodities riding recent momentum . My concern Am I letting recency bias and FOMO drive me away from a solid longterm strategy Questions for the community For those 10 years into index investing have you successfully added speculative positions without derailing your plan Is there merit to scratching the itch with a small allocation to stay disciplined on the core or does it usually snowball At what point does diversification into sectors become counterproductive stockpicking Not_looking for specific ticker advice just perspective from experienced investors whove navigated this psychological challenge . Thanks"

      "selftext": "So I'm currently running 2 airbnbs in my town with a price of $70usd per night and I see there's a huge opportunity where you can make an airbnb with swimming pool + amazing interior design and then you can up the price to $500 USD per night. I'm building this banglo and will split it into two units of airbnb. Each unit can accommodate up to 10 guests, 4 bedroom, 5 beds and 3 bathroom. I'm planning to charge $500 USD per night for this one. Let's do the math: $500usd x 15nights (normal season) = $7,500usd $7,500usd - $600expenses = $6,900usd $6,900usd * 70% profit sharing with my airbnb manager = $4,830usd $4,830usd x 2units = $9,660 net profit per month $9,660 x 12months = $115,920usd per year net profit So the capex for land acquisition, construction, interior design, swimming pool construction, air conditioner, electronics like tv etc is $250k give or take. Annual net profit is $115,920usd. So that gives you around 45% - 50% annual roi give or take. My question to you is, I've looked around the investment opportunities in Kuala Lumpur and I can't find one with this much roi. It's like I have found the holy grail. The closest investment opportunity I found is called Balitecture in bali. Actually I'm copying their bali themed interior design home and make one for my airbnb. Their roi is much higher since bali is more touristry. So my question is, is this as high as it can get or there's higher returns in terms of property and airbnb? I'm also thinking of doing like balitecture where I build airbnb villas for foreigners to buy the property and they can earn the profits. TL;DR: $250k investment, 50.5% annual ROI ($100k USD per year net profit)",

      "selftext_processed": "So Im currently running 2 airbnbs in my town with a price of $ 70usd per night and I see theres a huge opportunity where you can make an airbnb with swimming pool amazing interior design and then you can up the price to $ 500 USD per night . Im building this banglo and will split it into two units of airbnb . Each unit can accommodate up to 10 guests 4 bedroom 5 beds and 3 bathroom . Im planning to charge $ 500 USD per night for this one . Lets do the math $ 500usd x 15nights normal season $ 7500usd $ 7500usd $ 600expenses $ 6900usd $ 6900usd 70 % profit sharing with my airbnb manager $ 4830usd $ 4830usd x 2units $ 9660 net profit per month $ 9660 x 12months $ 115920usd per year net profit So the capex for land acquisition construction interior design swimming pool construction air conditioner electronics like tv etc is $ 250k give or take . Annual net profit is $ 115920usd . So that gives you around 45 % 50 % annual roi give or take . My question to you is Ive looked around the investment opportunities in Kuala Lumpur and I cant find one with this much roi . Its like I have found the holy grail . The closest investment opportunity I found is called Balitecture in bali . Actually Im copying their bali themed interior design home and make one for my airbnb . Their roi is much higher since bali is more touristry . So my question is is this as high as it can get or theres higher returns in terms of property and airbnb Im also thinking of doing like balitecture where I build airbnb villas for foreigners to buy the property and they can earn the profits . TLDR $ 250k investment 50.5 % annual ROI $ 100k USD per year net profit"

      "selftext": "I like the way my friend treats money and investments. So I have a friend who's kind of obsessive about investment due diligence, and honestly, I used to think he was paranoid. Now I think he's a genius. For any private investment over $50K, he has a standing process: lawyer reviews the legal docs, AND he hires [private investigator]( to verify everything else. Every single time. No exceptions. I'm talking real estate deals, private equity, syndications, business partnerships - doesn't matter. If it's not a publicly traded security with regulatory oversight, he investigates. His reasoning: \"A lawyer tells me if the contract is legal. An investigator tells me if the *people* are honest and the *claims* are real. Both matter.\" Three times this saved his @ ss: Deal 1: Real estate development fund ($250K almost lost) - Luxury condo development in Seattle, 18% returns promised. Lawyer said contract looked fine. PI investigation found the developer's \"previous successful projects\" actually failed with investor losses, multiple hidden lawsuits, fake pre-sales, and inflated property appraisal. Investigation cost about $5K, saved $250K when project never broke ground. Deal 2: Tech startup ($200K + avoided lawsuit) - \"Pre-IPO\" opportunity with claimed patents and Fortune 500 partnerships. Legal structure was proper. PI found \"patents\" were just applications not grants, \"partnerships\" were only discussions, revenue was fabricated through related parties, and founder had scammed investors before. It saved $200K plus lawsuit trouble. Company collapsed, SEC investigated for fraud. Deal 3: Private lending ($150K saved) - Bridge loan secured by commercial property. Note looked legally sound. PI discovered property had $500K in senior liens making the position worthless, borrower had bankruptcy pattern, business was losing money, and assets were judgment-proof. Cost $3K, saved $150K when borrower defaulted months later. And this works! Lawyers catch legal problems. Investigators catch *people* problems and *truth* problems. A contract can be perfectly legal and still be a terrible investment if the person behind it is dishonest or incompetent. Most fraud isn't illegal contract terms - it's lying about facts. \"We have this partnership\" (we don't). \"Property is worth this\" (it's not). \"I've successfully done this before\" (actually failed). Lawyers don't verify claims, they verify legal structure. That's where investigators come in. I used to think my friend was paranoid. Now I think everyone else is naive. In public markets you have regulatory oversight, audited financials, disclosures. In private investments? You have whatever the promoter tells you. Spending 2-5% of investment amount on professional verification isn't paranoia, it's basic risk management. Yeah, sometimes the investigation finds nothing wrong and you pay $3-5K for peace of mind. But when it catches something? The ROI is infinite. Anyone else do this level of due diligence? Or am I and my friend the weird ones?",

So I have a friend whos kind of obsessive about investment due diligence and honestly I used to think he was paranoid . Now I think hes a genius . For any private investment over $ 50K he has a standing process lawyer reviews the legal docs AND he hires private investigator to verify everything else . Every single time . No_exceptions . Im talking real estate deals private equity syndications business partnerships doesnt matter . If its not_a publicly traded security with regulatory oversight he investigates . His reasoning A lawyer tells me if the contract is legal . An investigator tells me if the people are honest and the claims are real . Both matter . Three times this saved his ss Deal 1 Real estate development fund $ 250K almost lost Luxury condo development in Seattle 18 % returns promised . Lawyer said contract looked fine . PI investigation found the developers previous successful projects actually failed with investor losses multiple hidden lawsuits fake presales and inflated property appraisal . Investigation cost about $ 5K saved $ 250K when project never_broke ground . Deal 2 Tech startup $ 200K avoided lawsuit PreIPO opportunity with claimed patents and Fortune 500 partnerships . Legal structure was proper . PI found patents were just applications not_grants partnerships were only discussions revenue was fabricated through related parties and founder had scammed investors before . It saved $ 200K plus lawsuit trouble . Company collapsed SEC investigated for fraud . Deal 3 Private lending $ 150K saved Bridge loan secured by commercial property . Note looked legally sound . PI discovered property had $ 500K in senior liens making the position worthless borrower had bankruptcy pattern business was losing money and assets were judgmentproof . Cost $ 3K saved $ 150K when borrower defaulted months later . And this works Lawyers catch legal problems . Investigators catch people problems and truth problems . A contract can be perfectly legal and still be a terrible investment if the person behind it is dishonest or incompetent . Most fraud isnt illegal contract terms its lying about facts . We have this partnership we dont . Property is worth this its not_Ive successfully done this before actually failed . Lawyers dont verify claims they verify legal structure . Thats where investigators come in . I used to think my friend was paranoid . Now I think everyone else is naive . In public markets you have regulatory oversight audited financials disclosures . In private investments You have whatever the promoter tells you . Spending 25 % of investment amount on professional verification isnt paranoia its basic risk management . Yeah sometimes the investigation finds nothing_wrong and you pay $ 35K for peace of mind . But when it catches something The ROI is infinite . Anyone else do this level of due diligence Or am I and my friend the weird ones"

      "selftext": "A few years ago, I invested 100k into a stock that went bankrupt. The ticker was SDC, now it is SDCCQ. This year, I made 100k selling puts. I wanted to sell my worthless stock at 0 for a loss so I wouldn't have to pay taxes on the gains. I contacted robinhood, and filled out the Worthless Security form. I just got back this email, saying \"you recently requested the removal of securities deemed worthless in your Robinhood account. Your request couldn’t be completed because there has been recent activity that suggests there may still be an active market for the security you requested to remove. Robinhood cannot remove a security that has or may have an active market. An active market could be indicated through trading data reported across the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), recent bid/ask data, or other trading data.\" Is there anything I can do? Is there a way I can take a loss on this bankrupt stock so that I can offset it against my gains? I was not expecting this reply. I also have a limit sell order for SDCCQ for $0.0001 but its not selling. Any advice?",

I wanted to sell my worthless stock at 0 for a loss so I wouldnt have to pay taxes on the gains . I contacted robinhood and filled out the Worthless Security form . I just got back this email saying you recently requested the removal of securities deemed worthless in your Robinhood account . Your request couldn ’ t be completed because there has been recent activity that suggests there may still be an active market for the security you requested to remove . Robinhood can not remove a security that has or may have an active market . An active market could be indicated through trading data reported across the Consolidated Audit Trail “ CAT ” recent bidask data or other trading data . Is there anything I can do Is there a way I can take a loss on this bankrupt stock so that I can offset it against my gains I was not_expecting this reply . I also have a limit sell order for SDCCQ for $ 0.0001 but its not_selling . Any advice"

      "selftext": "Okay, so I managed to run up 500 to 90k within a month and then proceeded to lose nearly all within a week, so far managing to lose \\~80k in the span of one week. Now I’m down to my last 13.5k (transferred everything over to robinhood due to slightly more favorable buying power rules as seen in the last image which says 11.5k but another 2k wire is en route from webull so it’s 13.5k). Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely, but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions. Let this be a warning to everyone else not to delude yourself into thinking you’re a genius when you get lucky with gambling. Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn’t. 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I’m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future, so it’s certainly not the end of the world, but damn does this hurt. Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks. Probably gonna need some time to mentally recover from this. TDLR: Don’t touch options. They will ruin your life.",

Now I ’ m down to my last 13.5k transferred everything over to robinhood due to slightly more favorable buying power rules as seen in the last image which says 11.5k but another 2k wire is en route from webull so it ’ s 13.5k . Long story short is that I had a hell of a run with spy 0dtes and started really blowing up naively thinking that this would continue indefinitely but then ego got the best of me and I started spiraling downwards and got fucked over by theta on many occasions . Let this be a warning to everyone else not_to delude yourself into thinking you ’ re a genius when you get lucky with gambling . Trying to get rich quick only works until it doesn ’ t . 25M with a six figure tech job and feeling I ’ m doing pretty well in my career with a lot more upside in the future so it ’ s certainly not_the end of the world but damn does this hurt . Greed really got the best of me since I wanted to get rich in weeks rather than years and ultimately got my lesson from the school of hard knocks . Probably gon na need some time to mentally recover from this . TDLR Don ’ t touch options . They will ruin your life ."

      "selftext": "I’m a US tax resident (NRI from India) trying to understand the **PFIC implications of Indian mutual funds**, and I want to make sure my mental model is correct before I rule them out entirely. From what I understand: * Most **Indian mutual funds** qualify as **PFICs** under US tax law * PFIC taxation can mean: * Punitive tax rates * Interest charges * Complex annual filing (Form 8621) * Even “plain vanilla” equity or index mutual funds in India fall under PFIC rules * ETFs and stocks listed in the US do *not* have this issue My questions: 1. Is it correct that **almost all Indian mutual funds are PFICs**, regardless of fund type? 2. Are there *any* realistic exceptions or structures that avoid PFIC treatment? 3. Do most US NRIs: * Avoid Indian mutual funds entirely? * Use US-domiciled ETFs instead? * Stick to bank products (FDs/RDs) despite lower returns? 4. Practically speaking, is the compliance + tax drag so bad that Indian mutual funds are just not worth it for US taxpayers? I’m not asking for personal tax advice, just looking to validate my understanding and hear how others have approached this trade-off in practice. Thanks in advance!",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m a US tax resident NRI from India trying to understand the PFIC implications of Indian mutual funds and I want to make sure my mental model is correct before I rule them out entirely . From what I understand Most Indian mutual funds qualify as PFICs under US tax law PFIC taxation can mean Punitive tax rates Interest charges Complex annual filing Form 8621 Even “ plain vanilla ” equity or index mutual funds in India fall under PFIC rules ETFs and stocks listed in the US do not have this issue My questions 1 . Is it correct that almost all Indian mutual funds are PFICs regardless of fund type 2 . Are there any realistic exceptions or structures that avoid PFIC treatment 3 . Do most US NRIs Avoid Indian mutual funds entirely Use USdomiciled ETFs instead Stick to bank products FDsRDs despite lower returns 4 . Practically speaking is the compliance tax drag so bad that Indian mutual funds are just not_worth it for US taxpayers I ’ m not_asking for personal tax advice just looking to validate my understanding and hear how others have approached this tradeoff in practice . Thanks in advance"

      "selftext": "TL;DR: MicroStrategy (MSTR) is trading below the value of it's Bitcoin holdings. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong, positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle, and supported by growing institutional adoption. Bitcoin’s Slide & Market Factors - Macro risk-off: BTC dropped 30-40% from October highs due to higher rates, tech volatility, and a strong USD. ETF outflows & liquidations: Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $3.4B outflows in Nov 2025; leveraged crypto positions triggered $1B in forced liquidations. Crypto winter: BTC erased much of its YTD gains. When Bitcoin falls, “Bitcoin proxy” stocks like MSTR often fall even more. MSTR = Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure - Bitcoin-driven stock: MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down. During the recent dip, MSTR dropped faster than BTC. Balance sheet buys: MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt, giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility. Software business: Enterprise analytics platform still grows (Q3 2025 revenue \\~$128.7M, +10.9% YoY; subscription revenue \\~$46M, +65% YoY). Small compared to BTC, but it exists. Bitcoin Holdings & Per-Share Math - Total BTC: 671,268 BTC ($58.4B at $87,049/BTC) 87,000/BTC). Shares outstanding (diluted): \\~312,000,000 BTC per share: 671,268 ÷ 312,000,000 ≈ 0.00215 BTC/share Dollar value per share of BTC: 0.00215 × $87,000 ≈ $187/share MSTR trades at \\~$157.88. Each share represents roughly $187 of Bitcoin value, plus a small, growing software business and cash reserves. Market cap vs BTC holdings: \\~$46B vs \\~$58.4B, trading below implied BTC value. Impact of BTC moves: Every $10,000 rise in BTC adds \\~$21.5/share or \\~$6.7B total to MSTR’s BTC holdings. Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 - Post-halving cycle dynamics: Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024. Historically, years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases (2012, 2016, 2020). Supply growth slows, while demand continues to increase. Institutional accumulation: Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips, adding structural demand. Banks entering crypto services: JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading, lending, and custody services. Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral, unlocking liquidity without selling BTC. More institutional access reduces perceived risk, increases adoption, and supports price stability. Macro tailwinds: If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases, risk assets like BTC historically outperform. Global adoption & limited supply: More users, corporations, and payment integration, combined with a capped supply (21M BTC), drives scarcity and potential upside. Why 2026 Could Be Favorable - BTC leverage: If Bitcoin rallies, MSTR (and MSTU) amplifies the move. Balance sheet & capital strategy: They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt. Software + subscriptions: Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto. Structural advantage: Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets. Institutional tailwinds: Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand. Bottom line: MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing. Short-term swings are sentiment-driven, but structurally the company is strong. With historical post-halving trends, institutional accumulation, limited supply, and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin, 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains. Current positions: 2x leverage MSTR Bull (MSTU) - 2890 units @ $9.92. Continuing to DCA",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR MicroStrategy MSTR is trading below the value of its Bitcoin holdings . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong positioned to benefit from the next Bitcoin bull cycle and supported by growing institutional adoption . Bitcoin ’ s Slide Market Factors Macro riskoff BTC dropped 3040 % from October highs due to higher rates tech volatility and a strong USD . ETF outflows liquidations Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw $ 3.4B outflows in Nov 2025 leveraged crypto positions triggered $ 1B in forced liquidations . Crypto winter BTC erased much of its YTD gains . When Bitcoin falls “ Bitcoin proxy ” stocks like MSTR often fall even more . MSTR Leveraged Bitcoin Exposure Bitcoindriven stock MSTR amplifies BTC moves up or down . During the recent dip MSTR dropped faster than BTC . Balance sheet buys MicroStrategy continues acquiring Bitcoin via stock and debt giving leverage on BTC rallies while retaining flexibility . Software business Enterprise analytics platform still grows Q3 2025 revenue $ 128.7M 10.9 % YoY subscription revenue $ 46M 65 % YoY . Small compared to BTC but it exists . Bitcoin Holdings PerShare Math Total BTC 671268 BTC $ 58.4B at $ 87049BTC 87000BTC . Shares outstanding diluted 312000000 BTC per share 671268 ÷ 312000000 ≈ 0.00215 BTCshare Dollar value per share of BTC 0.00215 × $ 87000 ≈ $ 187share MSTR trades at $ 157.88 . Each share represents roughly $ 187 of Bitcoin value plus a small growing software business and cash reserves . Market cap vs BTC holdings $ 46B vs $ 58.4B trading below implied BTC value . Impact of BTC moves Every $ 10000 rise in BTC adds $ 21.5share or $ 6.7B total to MSTR ’ s BTC holdings . Why Bitcoin Could Go Up in 2026 Posthalving cycle dynamics Last Bitcoin halving was in April 2024 . Historically years 2–3 after a halving are strong bull phases 2012 2016 2020 . Supply growth slows while demand continues to increase . Institutional accumulation Large institutions and corporate treasuries continue quietly buying Bitcoin on dips adding structural demand . Banks entering crypto services JPMorgan and other major banks are exploring crypto trading lending and custody services . Bitcoin can be used as loan collateral unlocking liquidity without selling BTC . More institutional access reduces perceived risk increases adoption and supports price stability . Macro tailwinds If the Fed starts cutting rates or inflation eases risk assets like BTC historically outperform . Global adoption limited supply More users corporations and payment integration combined with a capped supply 21M BTC drives scarcity and potential upside . Why 2026 Could Be Favorable BTC leverage If Bitcoin rallies MSTR and MSTU amplifies the move . Balance sheet capital strategy They can acquire Bitcoin while managing cash and debt . Software subscriptions Small recurring revenue provides a floor outside crypto . Structural advantage Few public companies combine BTC exposure with access to capital markets . Institutional tailwinds Banks and other institutions adopting crypto services reduce risk perception and expand demand . Bottom line MSTR and MSTU are leveraged ways to play Bitcoin with corporate backing . Shortterm swings are sentimentdriven but structurally the company is strong . With historical posthalving trends institutional accumulation limited supply and banks beginning to integrate Bitcoin 2026 could be a favorable year for BTC — and your MSTU position could amplify those gains . Current positions 2x leverage MSTR Bull MSTU 2890 units $ 9.92 . Continuing to DCA"

      "selftext": "I’ve been watching Broadcom (AVGO) closely, and it feels like the debate around this stock has quietly shifted. This isn’t really about “is Broadcom a good company?” anymore almost everyone agrees it is. The real question seems to be: Has the market already priced in too much perfection? Here’s where I see the split: Bull case: Strong AI networking + custom silicon exposure Massive backlog with hyperscaler customers Software cash flows (VMware) supporting buybacks and dividends Management with a long track record of execution Bear case: Valuation already assumes sustained AI capex with no hiccups AI related products may pressure margins near term Backlog ≠ guaranteed revenue timing If AI spending cools even slightly, there’s not much valuation cushion What makes AVGO tricky is that it’s not a hype stock it’s a disciplined compounder but it’s now being priced like an AI must-win. So I’m curious how others here think about it: Is AVGO fairly valued given its consistency and cash flow, or Is this one of those names where “great company” ≠ “great entry price” right now? Not trying to push a trade genuinely interested in how long term investors here are framing the risk/reward at these levels.",

The real question seems to be Has the market already priced in too much perfection Here ’ s where I see the split Bull case Strong AI networking custom silicon exposure Massive backlog with hyperscaler customers Software cash flows VMware supporting buybacks and dividends Management with a long track record of execution Bear case Valuation already assumes sustained AI capex with no_hiccups AI related products may pressure margins near term Backlog ≠ guaranteed revenue timing If AI spending cools even slightly there ’ s not_much valuation cushion What makes AVGO tricky is that it ’ s not_a hype stock it ’ s a disciplined compounder but it ’ s now being priced like an AI mustwin . So I ’ m curious how others here think about it Is AVGO fairly valued given its consistency and cash flow or Is this one of those names where “ great company ” ≠ “ great entry price ” right now Not_trying to push a trade genuinely interested in how long term investors here are framing the riskreward at these levels ."

This is a conviction portfolio. I’m 19, I have 60k to invest, and I’m willing to take on risk. I’m not the type to fold under pressure. Even if there are 5 bad years in a row, I’ll stay strong, and if anything, buy more as long as the fundamentals are solid. I want to create the structure of my portfolio and stick to it, and make yearly rebalances. I’m coming here one more time before I officially put my money in, because for me 60k is a lot and it took a hell of a grind to save up. So when I do this, I want to do it right. My ETFs are the backbone of my portfolio. Stable and steady growth is the idea, allowing my money to compound. Next, BTC at 10% makes sense to me. I know it’s a volatile beast, but I’m not selling anytime soon, and I believe it has a solid future over the next decade. I can stomach the swings. Now, my individual picks are where I’ve received the most criticism, since I’ve been told I already have all these picks within my ETFs. I’m aware of this, and I trimmed it down to 15%. My thought process was choosing the companies I have the most faith in regarding their long-term growth to get above-average returns. I know this means I’m doubling down on American growth, and to be frank, I’m okay with that. Next is nuclear. I tried keeping it as small as possible, and I’m still thinking about trimming down URA, but nuclear is a bet I’m willing to take. I could talk for hours about why, but I’ll keep it short: I just think it’s ridiculous that the entry point is cheaper than solar when it has 1000x the potential. I also understand the massive risks, and if it goes to 0, I can stomach it. Overall, what do you guys think? Am I ready? All advice and criticism is welcome.",

This is a conviction portfolio . I ’ m 19 I have 60k to invest and I ’ m willing to take on risk . I ’ m not_the type to fold under pressure . Even if there are 5 bad years in a row I ’ ll stay strong and if anything buy more as long as the fundamentals are solid . I want to create the structure of my portfolio and stick to it and make yearly rebalances . I ’ m coming here one more time before I officially put my money in because for me 60k is a lot and it took a hell of a grind to save up . So when I do this I want to do it right . My ETFs are the backbone of my portfolio . Stable and steady growth is the idea allowing my money to compound . Next BTC at 10 % makes sense to me . I know it ’ s a volatile beast but I ’ m not_selling anytime soon and I believe it has a solid future over the next decade . I can stomach the swings . Now my individual picks are where I ’ ve received the most criticism since I ’ ve been told I already have all these picks within my ETFs . I ’ m aware of this and I trimmed it down to 15 % . My thought process was choosing the companies I have the most faith in regarding their longterm growth to get aboveaverage returns . I know this means I ’ m doubling down on American growth and to be frank I ’ m okay with that . Next is nuclear . I tried keeping it as small as possible and I ’ m still thinking about trimming down URA but nuclear is a bet I ’ m willing to take . I could talk for hours about why but I ’ ll keep it short I just think it ’ s ridiculous that the entry point is cheaper than solar when it has 1000x the potential . I also understand the massive risks and if it goes to 0 I can stomach it . Overall what do you guys think Am I ready All advice and criticism is welcome ."

      "selftext": "Recently I have been delving deeper into Micron Corporation particularly its business situation in terms of the demand for AI-driven memory and high-bandwidth memory (HBM). The management seems very confident, believing that HBM will remain in short supply for a long time to come and the demand for AI data centers has a structural difference from previous memory cycles. After going through a downturn, the prices of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory (NAND) seem to be stabilizing. From historical experience, this indicates the beginning of a recovery. Meanwhile the memory industry is always cyclical, and it is difficult to determine how much of this strong trend is truly driven by AI-driven demand and how much is just a normal inventory reduction rebound under supply shortages. For those who are interested in Micron (MU) or the memory market, what do you think are the truly important factors this time? Is it the allocation of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and whether long-term contracts can change the cycle, or do you still mainly focus on price and capacity expansion which were the key factors in previous cycles? I'm curious about how others view the current situation of Micron.",

For those who are interested in Micron MU or the memory market what do you think are the truly important factors this time Is it the allocation of highbandwidth memory HBM and whether longterm contracts can change the cycle or do you still mainly focus on price and capacity expansion which were the key factors in previous cycles Im curious about how others view the current situation of Micron ."

      "selftext": "It's an age old question, and I'm invested in both. But I wrestle mentally with which is the better choice. Most of the time the comparison isn't apples to apples because RE is often bought with leverage whereas plain equities aren't. Most retail investors aren't managing leverage by rolling futures etc. But what if you want to leverage equities to the same extent as a RE investment, take into account financing terms, depreciation benefits, recapture, taxes, hedging strategies for equities drawdowns, and all the works! Which is the better choice. Here is a summary of such a discussion including assumptions and conclusions. Feel free to double check (easy w LLM) and/or roast the conclusion as much as you want in either direction. LETF (3x) Exposure: $100,000 Leverage cost: 2.5%/yr Dividend: 0.75%/yr Price appreciation: 28%/yr (UPRO) or 40%/yr (TQQQ) Tax rate: 40% short-term capital gains on all gains + 0% tax on dividend for simplicity (can include later) --made it STCG because one would likely need to institute some hedging to prevent catastrophic loss. Duration: 5 years Real Estate Property: $100,000 Down payment: 33% → $33,000 Mortgage: 67% → $67,000 Mortgage interest: 5.5% Accelerated depreciation (MACRS 5-year): assume ~20%/yr Rental income: 6% → $6,000/yr → taxed at 35% → $3,900 net Appreciation: 3% or 5%/yr Depreciation recapture: 25% of total depreciation Duration: 5 years Net Gain 3x LETF (UPRO, 28%) 149,050 3x LETF (TQQQ, 40%) 254,050 Real Estate (3%/yr, accelerated depreciation) 94,000 Includes rental + depreciation − recapture − interest Real Estate (5%/yr) 105,675 Looks like as long as you can manage market downturns, LETFs could possibly provide a better return under these assumptions.

But what if you want to leverage equities to the same extent as a RE investment take into account financing terms depreciation benefits recapture taxes hedging strategies for equities drawdowns and all the works Which is the better choice . Here is a summary of such a discussion including assumptions and conclusions . Feel free to double check easy w LLM andor roast the conclusion as much as you want in either direction . LETF 3x Exposure $ 100000 Leverage cost 2.5 % yr Dividend 0.75 % yr Price appreciation 28 % yr UPRO or 40 % yr TQQQ Tax rate 40 % shortterm capital gains on all gains 0 % tax on dividend for simplicity can include later made it STCG because one would likely need to institute some hedging to prevent catastrophic loss . Duration 5 years Real Estate Property $ 100000 Down payment 33 % → $ 33000 Mortgage 67 % → $ 67000 Mortgage interest 5.5 % Accelerated depreciation MACRS 5year assume 20 % yr Rental income 6 % → $ 6000yr → taxed at 35 % → $ 3900 net Appreciation 3 % or 5 % yr Depreciation recapture 25 % of total depreciation Duration 5 years Net Gain 3x LETF UPRO 28 % 149050 3x LETF TQQQ 40 % 254050 Real Estate 3 % yr accelerated depreciation 94000 Includes rental depreciation − recapture − interest Real Estate 5 % yr 105675 Looks like as long as you can manage market downturns LETFs could possibly provide a better return under these assumptions .

Secondly, to confirm the continued upward trend, it needs to break through 116. As I've said before, it generally follows Nvidia; NBIS is like a leveraged stock of Nvidia, and it surges whenever NVDA rises This rocket stock has more than doubled in less than a month from its low point. Next, I think the focus will shift to the AI ​​sector, and this rocket stock will take a break. NVDA is the most stable, NBIS is more aggressive, and AVGO is also a good option.

I added a bit more in early October, so now Intel makes up about 30% of my portfolio though I’m wondering if that’s a bit too high. A lot of people in the market aren’t super bullish on Intel, but it’s worth noting that the U.S. government agreed to put around $8.9 billion into the company at the end of August. If Intel executes well strategically, I think the next earnings report could be a major turning point. What do you guys think?",

I added a bit more in early October so now Intel makes up about 30 % of my portfolio though I ’ m wondering if that ’ s a bit too high . A lot of people in the market aren ’ t super bullish on Intel but it ’ s worth noting that the U.S. government agreed to put around $ 8.9 billion into the company at the end of August . If Intel executes well strategically I think the next earnings report could be a major turning point . What do you guys think"

So in this case I set a certain amount, lets say $2k. I split the amount in 3 parts and enter on red days within 1-2 weeks. In some cases if I see that stock it not doing well for 6-8 months, I may relocate funds to other similar stock with good fundamentals but may slightly oversold.

      "selftext": "Infy Adr 50% spike says... What infy adr spike said? Was it technical glitch? Was it Pump & Dump (just guessing)? Google says: Explanation of the Spike Technical Glitch: Several financial data platforms reportedly misidentified the 'INFY' ticker, potentially confusing automated trading systems and triggering aggressive, self-reinforcing buy orders. Short Squeeze: Market analysts suggested a major lender recalled a large number of Infosys ADR shares lent to short sellers. The sudden, forced buying to cover these positions in a thinly traded market drove the price up sharply. Low Liquidity: The event occurred on a Friday during the holiday period when many institutional traders were absent, amplifying the impact of the automated buying and share recalls on the price. Key Takeaways Fundamentals Unchanged: Infosys issued a formal clarification to the stock exchanges stating there were no material events or corporate announcements that would justify the price movement, confirming the company's fundamentals remained stable. Domestic Market Disconnect: The price surge was isolated to the U.S. market. The company's shares on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in India closed with only a modest gain of 0.7% on the same day, reinforcing the notion that the ADR spike was an isolated anomaly. Regulatory Scrutiny: The incident has highlighted vulnerabilities in ADR trading mechanisms and data integrity, prompting demand for market scrutiny from the NYSE and SEC. Then why infy adr declining??",

      "title": "On Uber: AVs, Take Rates, and Fragmentation",
      "selftext": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words: AV disruption. As an Uber investor, it probably goes without saying, but I disagree and I’m going to show you why. The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios: 1. **The “In-House” Threat:** AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits. 2. **The “Squeeze” Threat:** As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won’t accept Uber’s take rates. I am going to address both of these, but let’s start with the crux of the point two: Uber’s Take Rate. # Understanding Uber’s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this: As AV companies like Waymo, Tesla, and Zoox scale, the power dynamic of the ride-share industry will shift. The fleet owner-operators, in order to earn a payback on their capex investments, will require a larger share of the pie. They will reject the \\~30% mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys. In essence, they will push Uber’s take rate down to 20% or lower, eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing, and in turn, jeopardizing the investment thesis. At a surface level, this is a valid concern. A drop in take rates from 30% to 20% looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber’s growth prospects. But Uber’s financials tell a complicated story: **not all revenue dollars are created equal.** When you dig into the unit economics, Uber’s top line is artificially inflated by “pass-through” costs. I don’t think many investors are aware of this, so I am going to break it down. The bottom line is this: A 20% AV take rate isn’t necessarily a negative impact. In fact, it might be a more profitable outcome for the company - a tailwind. # The “Cloudy” 30%: The Human Ride Uber’s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of \\~30%. Take rate is defined as Revenue / Mobility Gross Bookings. It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers. The thing is, a significant portion of the reported revenue is a pass-through. It isn’t money that Uber keeps. A huge chunk of every fare you see in the top-line revenue isn't revenue at all, it’s an **insurance premium.** Uber’s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue (which inflates the headline Take Rate), but they have to immediately set it aside in a \"loss reserve\" provision to pay for future accidents. The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “other” line of Cost of Revenue. Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “real” revenue is even smaller. Q3 Mobility Revenue of $7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $2.04b. That is a gap of $5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn’t exist in Uber provided AV rides. # The “Clean” 20%: AV Rides Now, let’s look at the economics of AV rides. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 80/20 revenue split, stating in a recent interview: []( \"…any player should take that 80% \\[revenue split\\], because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves. So, economically, we're sitting in a very, very good place.\" While that headline number (20%) is lower than the current 30% mobility take rate, the cost structure is very different. 1. **No Insurance Liability:** The AV fleet owner (Waymo, etc.) carries the insurance on the asset. Uber’s “Cost of Revenue” for insurance drops to zero. 2. **No Driver Incentives:** You don’t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours. So, while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings, they keep a larger portion of the profit. # The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “Human Scenario” to a theoretical “AV Scenario” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber’s Q3’25 filings. To ensure a margin of safety, I used conservative assumptions. I estimated insurance costs at 28% of Uber’s revenue, and driver incentives at another 23%. These estimates are grounded in the $1.02B year-over-year jump in the \"Other\" cost line item (where insurance lives). In reality, Uber provisioned over $2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone, meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance. I ran two models: 1. **Conservative Model:** Adjusts only for insurance. 2. **Realistic “Less Conservative” Model:** Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc. **The results:** A 20% \"clean\" take rate from an AV ride-share is equal to or more profitable than a 30% \"cloudy\" take rate from a human. * In the **Human Scenario**, despite the 30% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” (what’s left after insurance, incentives, and processing) is roughly **$2.37 per ride**. * In the **AV Scenario**, with a 20% take rate, the “Real Net Revenue” jumps to **$3.90 per ride**. **That is a \\~65% increase in profit per ride.** # The Utilization Arbitrage A 20% take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar, they need to generate at least 25% more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal. I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that. In a recent earnings call, management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “**more productive than 99% of human drivers.**” When you plug an AV into Uber’s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform. Uber’s service isn't as simple as matching riders to drivers, it is a complex logistical challenge. This is the value of Uber’s Marketplace Liquidity**.** Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen. Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips, providing AV cars with high-margin routes while offloading complex edge-cases to the human drivers. Without Uber, a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle: Uber estimates that “**in a typical large city, a fixed (AV) fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95% of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs**.” Uber’s platform provides access to demand driven by **189 million monthly active customers** and can maximize AV utilization. **If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25%, which I am confident they can, the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments.** This isn’t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet. Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business. Today, the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be **>$2.00 per mile**, which is comparable to the total cost of a human-driven ride, **before spending any money on customer acquisition.** Standalone operators face \"Demand Generation\" costs that can run into the **billions annually**. Uber has already done this. By partnering with Uber, AV operators pay a fee (20% take rate) for the elimination of this massive cost. # The Aggregator Thesis: Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market, Waymo or Tesla, I believe they are missing the most likely outcome: **fragmentation**. My thesis is simple: **AV hardware will be a commodity.** In 10 years, autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization. Whether the car is built by Tesla, Waymo, or Zoox won't matter to the rider. The only thing that matters to riders is **liquidity** \\- who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowest/most reasonable price? The answer is Uber. Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by the AV - it is going to aggregate it. # Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market. If one AV player dominates the market (a highly unlikely \"Winner Take All\" scenario for Waymo ), that provider gains pricing power over Uber. But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers (Waymo, Cruise, Zoox, Tesla, Nuro, and others) Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on - access to the largest rider pool matters most. This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation. The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example. Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a **103% CAGR** through 2032. But what is more important for Uber, is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented. Now, I am not arguing there is no risk. The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales, the apps will fragment too, leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie. Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just **22% of US AV trips** in 2032, with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps. This is not an unreasonable assumption, I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via in-house apps as well. **But context matters**. This 22% share reflects the new and growing AV segment of ride-shares and does not account for Uber’s human-driver market. Even if Uber only gains 22% of the market, the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the **lower-cost of revenue** AV market, coupled with their core human drivers, is a net positive growth opportunity, not a existential crisis. Even so, I believe the 22% projection to be a bear-case scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber’s increased utilization. Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no single fleet operator gains leverage. Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy, repeatedly mentioning using \"Uber’s balance sheet\" to support AV partners. This is proactive and defensive capital allocation**.** Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it’s working. I am not arguing there is no AV risk. There certainly is. The next 1-3 years will be the defining period for this thesis. Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat. But if they do, the specific robotaxi brand won’t matter. Access to fast and cost-efficient rides is all that matters to the consumer. I’ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV, and they won’t mind paying an extra $1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides. # In Conclusion Uber isn’t going to be disrupted by AVs; it’s going to aggregate them. By trading “cloudy” high-take-rate mobility revenue for “clean” asset-light AV revenue, they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ride-sharing. **And we didn’t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats.** As Josh Brown (of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound) points out, we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4,000lb machines, an absurd model. The shift to small-scale AV robots (like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out) solves this inefficiency. Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment. The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs - wages and insurance for human drivers. AVs are a tailwind for Uber, not a major threat and the market refuses to accept that. **Disclosure**: I hold Uber stock. I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price. [](",

      "selftext_processed": "One of the primary arguments against Uber as an investment can be summarized in two words AV disruption . As an Uber investor it probably goes without saying but I disagree and I ’ m going to show you why . The bear case usually boils down to two hypothetical scenarios 1 . The “ InHouse ” Threat AV companies keep their trip sourcing exclusive to their own apps to maximize profits . 2 . The “ Squeeze ” Threat As AV companies scale and costs come down they will require higher margins and won ’ t accept Uber ’ s take rates . I am going to address both of these but let ’ s start with the crux of the point two Uber ’ s Take Rate . Understanding Uber ’ s Take Rates and the Impact of AVs The argument goes like this As AV companies like Waymo Tesla and Zoox scale the power dynamic of the rideshare industry will shift . The fleet owneroperators in order to earn a payback on their capex investments will require a larger share of the pie . They will reject the 30 % mobility take rate that Uber currently enjoys . In essence they will push Uber ’ s take rate down to 20 % or lower eating away at the cash generation and profitability Uber is currently experiencing and in turn jeopardizing the investment thesis . At a surface level this is a valid concern . A drop in take rates from 30 % to 20 % looks like it would have a significant impact on Uber ’ s growth prospects . But Uber ’ s financials tell a complicated story not all revenue dollars are created equal . When you dig into the unit economics Uber ’ s top line is artificially inflated by “ passthrough ” costs . I don ’ t think many investors are aware of this so I am going to break it down . The bottom line is this A 20 % AV take rate isn ’ t necessarily a negative impact . In fact it might be a more profitable outcome for the company a tailwind . The “ Cloudy ” 30 % The Human Ride Uber ’ s Q3 Mobility reporting reflects a headline take rate of 30 % . Take rate is defined as Revenue Mobility Gross Bookings . It is the revenue Uber generates after paying drivers . The thing is a significant portion of the reported revenue is a passthrough . It isn ’ t money that Uber keeps . A huge chunk of every fare you see in the topline revenue isnt revenue at all it ’ s an insurance premium . Uber ’ s financials reflect this insurance premium as revenue which inflates the headline Take Rate but they have to immediately set it aside in a loss reserve provision to pay for future accidents . The money comes in as top line revenue but is immediately removed in the “ other ” line of Cost of Revenue . Add in the driver incentives required to pay human drivers during peak hours and the “ real ” revenue is even smaller . Q3 Mobility Revenue of $ 7.6b turns into a mobility adjusted EBITDA of $ 2.04b . That is a gap of $ 5.6b lost to insurance and incentives… the majority of which doesn ’ t exist in Uber provided AV rides . The “ Clean ” 20 % AV Rides Now let ’ s look at the economics of AV rides . CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has noted that AV partners should be open to an 8020 revenue split stating in a recent interview …any player should take that 80 % revenue split because the benefits of utilization more than pay for themselves . So economically were sitting in a very very good place . While that headline number 20 % is lower than the current 30 % mobility take rate the cost structure is very different . 1 . No Insurance Liability The AV fleet owner Waymo etc . carries the insurance on the asset . Uber ’ s “ Cost of Revenue ” for insurance drops to zero . 2 . No Driver Incentives You don ’ t need to pay an AV a bonus to drive in peak hours . So while Uber takes a smaller portion of gross bookings they keep a larger portion of the profit . The Prove Out I ran the numbers to compare a standard “ Human Scenario ” to a theoretical “ AV Scenario ” based on actuals pulled directly from Uber ’ s Q3 ’ 25 filings . To ensure a margin of safety I used conservative assumptions . I estimated insurance costs at 28 % of Uber ’ s revenue and driver incentives at another 23 % . These estimates are grounded in the $ 1.02B yearoveryear jump in the Other cost line item where insurance lives . In reality Uber provisioned over $ 2.08B for insurance reserves in the first 9 months of 2025 alone meaning my model likely underestimates how much money Uber loses on insurance . I ran two models 1 . Conservative Model Adjusts only for insurance . 2 . Realistic “ Less Conservative ” Model Adjusts for both insurance and driver incentives and includes accounting for support fees etc . The results A 20 % clean take rate from an AV rideshare is equal to or more profitable than a 30 % cloudy take rate from a human . In the Human Scenario despite the 30 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” what ’ s left after insurance incentives and processing is roughly $ 2.37 per ride . In the AV Scenario with a 20 % take rate the “ Real Net Revenue ” jumps to $ 3.90 per ride . That is a 65 % increase in profit per ride . The Utilization Arbitrage A 20 % take rate implies that for an AV partner to voluntarily accept 80 cents on the dollar they need to generate at least 25 % more rides than they could on their own to break even in the deal . I am confident Uber is capable of delivering and data is already reflecting that . In a recent earnings call management revealed that Waymo vehicles operating on the Uber network in Austin and Atlanta were “ more productive than 99 % of human drivers. ” When you plug an AV into Uber ’ s demand network it becomes the most utilized vehicle on the platform . Uber ’ s service isnt as simple as matching riders to drivers it is a complex logistical challenge . This is the value of Uber ’ s Marketplace Liquidity . Uber has 10 years of historical data and proprietary algorithms that allow it to predict demand spikes before they happen . Uber has the unique ability to optimize trips providing AV cars with highmargin routes while offloading complex edgecases to the human drivers . Without Uber a standalone AV fleet faces a major mathematical hurdle Uber estimates that “ in a typical large city a fixed AV fleet designed to meet the weekly peak will have up to 95 % of vehicles idle during the multiple weekly troughs. ” Uber ’ s platform provides access to demand driven by 189 million monthly active customers and can maximize AV utilization . If Uber increases fleet ridership by just 25 % which I am confident they can the partner maximizes the return on their massive hardware investments . This isn ’ t even taking into account the massive overhead of operating an AV fleet . Look at the cost structure of a standalone AV business . Today the pure operating cost of an AV is estimated to be $ 2.00 per mile which is comparable to the total cost of a humandriven ride before spending any money on customer acquisition . Standalone operators face Demand Generation costs that can run into the billions annually . Uber has already done this . By partnering with Uber AV operators pay a fee 20 % take rate for the elimination of this massive cost . The Aggregator Thesis Fragmentation While social media and the market focus on a debate about who will win the AV market Waymo or Tesla I believe they are missing the most likely outcome fragmentation . My thesis is simple AV hardware will be a commodity . In 10 years autonomous vehicles will simply be commoditized car seats fighting for utilization . Whether the car is built by Tesla Waymo or Zoox wont matter to the rider . The only thing that matters to riders is liquidity who can provide a ride in 3 minutes for the lowestmost reasonable price The answer is Uber . Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by the AV it is going to aggregate it . Strategically Supporting Fragmentation Uber wants a fragmented market . If one AV player dominates the market a highly unlikely Winner Take All scenario for Waymo that provider gains pricing power over Uber . But if the market fragments into a dozen competing AV providers Waymo Cruise Zoox Tesla Nuro and others Uber becomes the best in class marketplace to list on access to the largest rider pool matters most . This is why Uber is strategically partnering with everyone to help increase competition and market fragmentation . The recent Nuro partnership is a perfect example . Morgan Stanley estimates that US AV miles driven will grow at a 103 % CAGR through 2032 . But what is more important for Uber is that MS expects the supply to become fragmented . Now I am not_arguing there is no_risk . The report also assumes that as AV hardware scales the apps will fragment too leaving Uber with a smaller slice of the growing AV rideshare pie . Morgan Stanley projects that Uber could capture just 22 % of US AV trips in 2032 with Waymo and Tesla capturing the bulk of the volume on their own apps . This is not_an unreasonable assumption I fully expect that even Uber AV partners will offer their rides via inhouse apps as well . But context matters . This 22 % share reflects the new and growing AV segment of rideshares and does not_account for Uber ’ s humandriver market . Even if Uber only gains 22 % of the market the overall TAM is growing and any market share of the lowercost of revenue AV market coupled with their core human drivers is a net positive growth opportunity not_a existential crisis . Even so I believe the 22 % projection to be a bearcase scenario and that AV hardware companies will see the benefit in outsourcing their logistics and customer acquisition costs to Uber and benefiting from Uber ’ s increased utilization . Uber is intentionally lowering the barrier to entry for AV companies to ensure no_single fleet operator gains leverage . Dara Khosrowshahi has been explicit about this strategy repeatedly mentioning using Uber ’ s balance sheet to support AV partners . This is proactive and defensive capital allocation . Uber is effectively acting as a funding source to prop up a fragmented supply base and it ’ s working . I am not_arguing there is no_AV risk . There certainly is . The next 13 years will be the defining period for this thesis . Uber must successfully onboard multiple competing fleets to maintain its liquidity moat . But if they do the specific robotaxi brand won ’ t matter . Access to fast and costefficient rides is all that matters to the consumer . I ’ ll go as far as saying that riders eventually wont care if their ride is from a human or an AV and they won ’ t mind paying an extra $ 1 per mile in exchange for fast and reliable transportation that Uber provides . In Conclusion Uber isn ’ t going to be disrupted by AVs it ’ s going to aggregate them . By trading “ cloudy ” hightakerate mobility revenue for “ clean ” assetlight AV revenue they are positioned to benefit from the increasing role of AV ridesharing . And we didn ’ t even touch on the impact to Uber Eats . As Josh Brown of Ritholtz Wealth and The Compound points out we are currently paying humans to transport burritos in 4000lb machines an absurd model . The shift to smallscale AV robots like the Nuro and Serve Robotics partnerships Uber is rolling out solves this inefficiency . Removing the human driver and the vehicle from the food delivery equation transforms the unit economics of the entire delivery segment . The growth of AV services provides Uber the ability to automate inefficiencies and cut back its largest costs wages and insurance for human drivers . AVs are a tailwind for Uber not_a major threat and the market refuses to accept that . Disclosure I hold Uber stock . I am long Uber and have been adding on any weakness in share price ."

      "selftext": "Global asset management giant Apollo is shifting to a defensive stance, adopting a series of strategies to address current market challenges. Apollo CEO Mark Rowan stated that the company's top priority is building the strongest possible balance sheet to ensure it is well-positioned to weather significant challenges in credit and equity markets. To this end, Apollo has taken three key measures: accumulating substantial cash reserves, deleveraging, and selling off high-risk debt assets. The rationale behind Apollo strategic shift lies in currently inflated asset prices, the unlikelihood of a significant long-term interest rate drop, and escalating geopolitical risks. Against this backdrop, Apollo has moved from aggressive investment to a conservative, defensive approach. First, Apollo has cleaned up its balance sheet, shifting to a \"cash is king\" model, reducing its exposure to AI-related loans and CIO risks, lowering leverage, and increasing interest rate hedging. These measures are setting a benchmark for the entire industry. This shift is not only Apollo response but also reflects the dual impact of deteriorating fundamentals and wavering confidence facing the private credit market. For example, last week, another large private equity firm, Blue Owl Capital, withdrew a $10 billion financing project due to risk concerns. Meanwhile, share prices of funds including KKR and BlackRock have plummeted, and bad debts have surged, indicating serious challenges in the credit market. Apollo defensive measures are being taken against the backdrop of a potential reckoning in the private credit industry. Mark Rowan has said that if you see one cockroach in the private credit market, it means there are likely more, suggesting he believes there is widespread systemic risk in the market. Despite the S&P 500 index rising nearly 15 percentage points this year, share prices of companies like FSKKR Capital and BlackRock's BDC have fallen sharply, and bad debt rates have surged. Competitors like Blue Owl Capital are still trying to address liquidity issues through mergers and acquisitions, but panic over valuation mismatches and redemption pressure is spreading in the market. In contrast, Apollo strategy of cleaning house early and accumulating cash reserves seems to be stockpiling resources for the coming economic downturn. Faced with this uncertain market environment, Apollo's conservative strategy appears particularly prudent and wise. As investors, we must maintain respect for the market at all times. With the end of the year approaching, allocating more funds to US Treasury bonds might be a good option for weathering the current economic climate, as US Treasury bonds are still considered a relatively safe investment in the current economic environment.",

      "selftext": "Since going public in 2021, Rocket Lab (RKLB) has seen its stock rise from around $10 to over $70 by 2025, representing a +600% return for early investors. However, it was 2025 that truly marked a turning point for the company. Over the year, Rocket Lab completed 21 successful launches of its Electron rocket, achieving a 100% success rate a critical milestone in the launch services industry. Following its final launch on December 21 (deploying the Japanese iQPS radar satellite), the stock rose by roughly 8%, approaching its recent highs around $77 per share (current price). In December 2025 alone, RKLB gained nearly 17%, driven by strong operational execution and growing expectations for 2026, particularly around the development of the Neutron rocket, designed for heavier payloads. I personally looked into using leverage via futures on tokenized versions of the stock through Bitget Onchain, but only large-cap names like NVDAon (NVIDIA), TSLAon (Tesla), and AAPLon were available. Rocket Lab is increasingly positioning itself as a credible challenger to SpaceX in the small satellite launch segment, supported by a growing backlog and expanding defense contracts. A key milestone was the $805 million contract awarded by the Space Development Agency (SDA) the largest in Rocket Lab’s history. According to Koontz, securing a contract of this scale reflects strong government confidence and suggests Rocket Lab could play a long-term role in U.S. space programs. From a strategic perspective, Rocket Lab benefits from deep vertical integration, controlling much of the value chain from manufacturing to launch services, while strengthening partnerships with institutional players such as NASA. These factors contribute to a durable competitive advantage against emerging rivals and position the company as a long-term beneficiary of both commercial and government-driven growth in the space economy. Personally, if Rocket Lab continues executing at this pace, I believe RKLB could still deliver attractive returns into 2026. That said, I’m open to opposing views feel free to comment if there are risks or negative factors I may be overlooking.",

      "selftext_processed": "Since going public in 2021 Rocket Lab RKLB has seen its stock rise from around $ 10 to over $ 70 by 2025 representing a 600 % return for early investors . However it was 2025 that truly marked a turning point for the company . Over the year Rocket Lab completed 21 successful launches of its Electron rocket achieving a 100 % success rate a critical milestone in the launch services industry . Following its final launch on December 21 deploying the Japanese iQPS radar satellite the stock rose by roughly 8 % approaching its recent highs around $ 77 per share current price . In December 2025 alone RKLB gained nearly 17 % driven by strong operational execution and growing expectations for 2026 particularly around the development of the Neutron rocket designed for heavier payloads . I personally looked into using leverage via futures on tokenized versions of the stock through Bitget Onchain but only largecap names like NVDAon NVIDIA TSLAon Tesla and AAPLon were available . Rocket Lab is increasingly positioning itself as a credible challenger to SpaceX in the small satellite launch segment supported by a growing backlog and expanding defense contracts . A key milestone was the $ 805 million contract awarded by the Space Development Agency SDA the largest in Rocket Lab ’ s history . According to Koontz securing a contract of this scale reflects strong government confidence and suggests Rocket Lab could play a longterm role in U.S. space programs . From a strategic perspective Rocket Lab benefits from deep vertical integration controlling much of the value chain from manufacturing to launch services while strengthening partnerships with institutional players such as NASA . These factors contribute to a durable competitive advantage against emerging rivals and position the company as a longterm beneficiary of both commercial and governmentdriven growth in the space economy . Personally if Rocket Lab continues executing at this pace I believe RKLB could still deliver attractive returns into 2026 . That said I ’ m open to opposing views feel free to comment if there are risks or negative factors I may be overlooking ."

      "selftext": "I have been paying attention to the artificial intelligence market recently and found that the impact of artificial intelligence on the U.S. economy is becoming more and more significant. Artificial intelligence investment continues to accumulate growth, and in the next few years, it may become a more important growth driver and key indicator. The influence of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more obvious. Although not all growth is due to artificial intelligence, its marginal effect is already quite significant, and its influence is penetrating into various industries, daily life, commerce, health care, transportation, education and industrial automation. Although the labor market has begun to weaken, it seems to be more like a normal adjustment of the employment market and a sign of the change of the times. Given that the artificial intelligence industry is dominated by a few key companies, even if there is a setback after overheating, the Bank of America also believes that its potential threats to the economy - including the impact on consumers and unemployment risks - are quite limited. Does this indicate that a new normal is coming? Why?",

      "title": "Overvalued Stocks, Sector Rotation, and the AI Dilemma? What Opportunities Lie Ahead in 2026?",
      "selftext": "Following a robust performance in 2025, market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026, with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential. Yet beneath this optimism, several factors warrant close attention. Valuations Hit Record Highs The S&P 500's valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble, reaching unprecedented levels. While the technology sector has been the primary driver, such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market. We are experiencing repeated volatility, and although high valuations pose resistance, these hurdles are not insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong. Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth, particularly pronounced in emerging markets. Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections, setting the bar exceptionally high. Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector, especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns. Sector Rotation: New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing, we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks. This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals. With technology stocks losing weight, cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention, while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments. Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year, January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks. As S&P 500 correlations decline, active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026, creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market. Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded, with investors brimming with confidence in equities, commodities, and economic growth. Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears. While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession, setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities. How do you view the market outlook for 2026? Will you remain committed to technology stocks, or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors?",

      "selftext_processed": "Following a robust performance in 2025 market sentiment widely anticipates this momentum will carry into 2026 with investors generally optimistic about further upside potential . Yet beneath this optimism several factors warrant close attention . Valuations Hit Record Highs The SP 500s valuation has surpassed the peak reached during the dot com bubble reaching unprecedented levels . While the technology sector has been the primary driver such elevated valuations raise concerns about the sustainability of the bull market . We are experiencing repeated volatility and although high valuations pose resistance these hurdles are not_insurmountable if fundamentals remain strong . Earnings Expectations Remain Elevated Global markets widely anticipate double digit earnings growth particularly pronounced in emerging markets . Yet current valuations already fully reflect these optimistic projections setting the bar exceptionally high . Risks are most pronounced in the technology sector especially concerning artificial intelligence investments and their expected returns . Sector Rotation New Focus As the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors show signs of slowing we are witnessing a rotation of capital toward defensive or cyclical stocks . This trend may persist into 2026 as investors reassess sector fundamentals . With technology stocks losing weight cyclical industries and stagflation resistant sectors are gaining attention while the upcoming earnings season may trigger further sector adjustments . Seasonal Risk Appetite and Active Stock Selection While seasonal risk appetite typically boosts equities early in the year January and February historically rank among the weakest months for stocks . As SP 500 correlations decline active stock selection will grow increasingly vital in 2026 creating opportunities for stock pickers to outperform the market . Market Sentiment Current market positions are crowded with investors brimming with confidence in equities commodities and economic growth . Yet the greatest risk remains the U.S. labor market and its potential to reignite recession fears . While markets currently price in only a low probability of recession setbacks in AI development could emerge as the next major micro risk for U.S. equities . How do you view the market outlook for 2026 Will you remain committed to technology stocks or are you adjusting your allocation to other sectors"

      "selftext": "Nike closed around 57 dollars, sitting near multi-year lows after a sharp post-earnings selloff. The stock is now down more than 30% from its 52-week highs, significantly underperforming both the broader market and other consumer discretionary names. From a short-term trading perspective, this level is starting to matter. Most of the recent selling appears event-driven, and price is now consolidating near prior support. Momentum is still weak, but downside pressure looks slower compared to the initial drop. This is not a long-term thesis. Demand and margin concerns remain. But at current levels, the risk reward for a technical bounce is becoming clearer, especially if the broader market stays stable. I’m watching closely rather than rushing in. What do others think, short-term bounce here or still falling?",

      "selftext": "The U.S. third quarter growth not only surpassed the second quarter's 3.8% but also far exceeded market expectations of 3.3%. Following the data release, Treasury yields rose sharply while stock indices opened slightly lower. Tech stocks broadly declined. Market expectations now project the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates twice in 2026 (down from three previous projections). This is a fascinating phenomenon! Ordinary people I've spoken with universally feel this year's economic conditions are poor, with employment and daily life proving challenging. Yet economic data, stock markets, and various asset performances all appear unrealistically strong. The devil is in the details. Data indicates that increased consumption by high income households was the primary driver of GDP growth (with substantially higher investment income being a key factor), while low and middle income families face hardships due to tariffs, employment pressures, and rising prices. Large corporations' massive investments in sectors like AI have boosted economic growth, yet small and medium sized enterprises continue to struggle. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the government shutdown will reduce fourth quarter GDP. I'd like to hear what opportunities everyone has identified and is sharing. Given the current situation, should we hold stocks through the holidays or lock in profits? Should we start planning ahead for next year?",

      "title": "What is Value Investing? (VI according to Graham & Buffet)",
      "selftext": "**Hey everybody,** The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments, each with their problems and own struggles. It is impossible to grasp the whole nest/market. To navigate through this jungle, you can use different methods and strategies. You can buy meme stocks, you can pump and dump cryp\\*o, you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car. Today our focus is \"**drum roll**\" Value Investing. **Definition:** Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham (and David Dodd). It is a strategy to help (not a guarantee) find undervalued stocks. It focuses on safety and long-term gains. **Understand what you understand** Make sure that you understand which \"departments\" of the stock market you truly understand. Map it out for yourself, nearly everybody has an area of competence. Also, I recommend (like the book) sticking to it. You branch out over time or develop new areas, but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something. I like being pitched new ideas, but if they are outside my area of competence, I don't invest. You start looking for companies and find one; what next? **Analysis** The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis, which can be divided into 2 main parts: **Quantitative Analysis** (numbers) **:** It's numbers: P/E, P/B, earnings, etc. Most of you have this part down, no doubt. Also, there are enough tools today that can help you. This part is \"easy\". **Qualitative Analysis** (understanding the business): The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers, but it is as important, if not more important, than just \"numbers\". I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many. * Understanding the business and where the company is going: * What is the vision of the company, short-term/long-term? * What makes the company better than others: USP, patents, monopoly, etc.? * What are the struggles of the company? * How is the market in general? How future-proof is the company and the market? * What makes them future-proof? **Examples why you need both:** 1. Example: Quantitative: Perfect numbers. Qualitative: It is in the postal market, which will disappear (depending on the country) in the next 5-10 years. 2. Example: Quantitative: Mid numbers (fairly valued or even slightly overvalued). Qualitative: Developed a new CPU which will be market-disruptive. In conclusion, numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story! **How to find undervalued stocks?** This can be a very \"creative\" process. There's no blueprint for it; you need to look out, and everybody develops a different \"hunting method\". **Crisis:** The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind. Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down. **Looking where no one else is willing to look:** Michael Burry did \"anti-value investing\" by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption. **Personal note:** During the pandemic, my sister called me (she works for a global player) and told me that the \"good\" times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products. That sparked my interest. I started calling everybody I know from different sectors, and everybody had the same story: home office with Microsoft products. I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon, 2. Microsoft would make some good profit. I went all in and bought them for 136€ (20k) and sold later for 275€. My best to this day. **In conclusion:** there is no real strategy for that but a direction. DeepFuckingValue said it: It's more like a feeling you can't really describe. You are buying a company, not a stock! (Buffett) This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks, because you don't care how the stock performs today or tomorrow; you focus the most on the business side, and if this is going well, the stock will sooner or later follow. **General Advice:** **Be patient.** Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity, and he does it full-time! I take even much longer; therefore, I invest in an ETF. **Value investing** doesn't teach you only when to invest but also when to exit! Having an **exit strategy** is truly underrated (if you need bad examples, go to WSB lol). **VI is not for everybody:** If you don't have the matching personality, don't! Find one that matches your personality. Be honest with yourself. **Sparring Partner:** Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas. The wiser the better! Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with. I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice (of course, when they've bought already), and when I don't recommend it, they get pissed... **First DD:** I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it. Did you know Waymo is owned by Alphabet ?... AHHH **READ THE FUCKING BOOK:** It has 600+ pages; I swear there is more written than P/E ratio... If you have questions feel free to ask. **Side note:** I tried my best.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey everybody The stock market is like an ant nest with its own departments each with their problems and own struggles . It is impossible to grasp the whole nestmarket . To navigate through this jungle you can use different methods and strategies . You can buy meme stocks you can pump and dump crypo you can 100x leverage on an option and get 100 likes because you lost your house and now live in a car . Today our focus is drum roll Value Investing . Definition Value Investing is a strategy developed and made popular by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd . It is a strategy to help not a guarantee find undervalued stocks . It focuses on safety and longterm gains . Understand what you understand Make sure that you understand which departments of the stock market you truly understand . Map it out for yourself nearly everybody has an area of competence . Also I recommend like the book sticking to it . You branch out over time or develop new areas but I see a lot of people investing all over the place because they read a Reddit post or something . I like being pitched new ideas but if they are outside my area of competence I dont invest . You start looking for companies and find one what next Analysis The tool VI uses is fundamental analysis which can be divided into 2 main parts Quantitative Analysis numbers Its numbers PE PB earnings etc . Most of you have this part down no_doubt . Also there are enough tools today that can help you . This part is easy . Qualitative Analysis understanding the business The second part is almost impossible to put into numbers but it is as important if not_more important than just numbers . I have a feeling that this part is overlooked by many . Understanding the business and where the company is going What is the vision of the company shorttermlongterm What makes the company better than others USP patents monopoly etc . What are the struggles of the company How is the market in general How futureproof is the company and the market What makes them futureproof Examples why you need both 1 . Example Quantitative Perfect numbers . Qualitative It is in the postal market which will disappear depending on the country in the next 510 years . 2 . Example Quantitative Mid numbers fairly valued or even slightly overvalued . Qualitative Developed a new CPU which will be marketdisruptive . In conclusion numbers are a good indicator but tell only half the story How to find undervalued stocks This can be a very creative process . Theres no_blueprint for it you need to look out and everybody develops a different hunting method . Crisis The classic one buying when Mr. Market reacts irrationally and everybody is losing their mind . Buffett bought BoA in 2011 during their crisis and trimmed in 2024 after the key interest rate went down . Looking where no_one else is willing to look Michael Burry did antivalue investing by shorting the housing market by looking into mortgagebacked securities MBS . Also it can be a small country or a hidden chamption . Personal note During the pandemic my sister called me she works for a global player and told me that the good times are over because they were starting home office soon with Microsoft products . That sparked my interest . I started calling everybody I know from different sectors and everybody had the same story home office with Microsoft products . I realized 1. the economy would gain momentum soon 2 . Microsoft would make some good profit . I went all in and bought them for 136€ 20k and sold later for 275€ . My best to this day . In conclusion there is no_real strategy for that but a direction . DeepFuckingValue said it Its more like a feeling you cant really describe . You are buying a company not_a stock Buffett This perspective really changed for me how I look at stocks because you dont care how the stock performs today or tomorrow you focus the most on the business side and if this is going well the stock will sooner or later follow . General Advice Be patient . Finding true gems takes time even Buffett sometimes takes a year to find a good opportunity and he does it fulltime I take even much longer therefore I invest in an ETF . Value investing doesnt teach you only when to invest but also when to exit Having an exit strategy is truly underrated if you need bad examples go to WSB lol . VI is not_for everybody If you dont have the matching personality dont Find one that matches your personality . Be honest with yourself . Sparring Partner Find someone who thinks like you and is ready to challenge your ideas . The wiser the better Also expect advice that something a lot of people struggle with . I get so many phone calls from people who just want me to confirm their choice of course when theyve bought already and when I dont recommend it they get pissed ... First DD I see so many people investing into a stock and than reading about it . Did you know Waymo is owned by Alphabet ... AHHH READ THE FUCKING BOOK It has 600 pages I swear there is more written than PE ratio ... If you have questions feel free to ask . Side note I tried my best ."

      "selftext": "I'm 55 and have about 200k in bonds yielding around 4.5% which feels inadequate for my retirement income needs. I keep reading about systematic options strategies that can generate 8 to 15% with defined risk, which would make a massive difference to my planning. The problem is I've never traded options in my life and the complexity is intimidating when I look at all the terminology, I understand stocks and bonds just fine but options feel like learning a completely different language. What I'm trying to figure out is whether this is realistic for someone my age to learn, or if the learning curve is so steep that I'd make costly mistakes before becoming competent. I also want to understand the time commitment because I don't want to spend my semi retirement glued to a screen watching markets. For those who made this transition later in life, how did you actually learn and what does the realistic day to day look like once you know what you're doing?",

      "selftext_processed": "Im 55 and have about 200k in bonds yielding around 4.5 % which feels inadequate for my retirement income needs . I keep reading about systematic options strategies that can generate 8 to 15 % with defined risk which would make a massive difference to my planning . The problem is Ive never_traded options in my life and the complexity is intimidating when I look at all the terminology I understand stocks and bonds just fine but options feel like learning a completely different language . What Im trying to figure out is whether this is realistic for someone my age to learn or if the learning curve is so steep that Id make costly mistakes before becoming competent . I also want to understand the time commitment because I dont want to spend my semi retirement glued to a screen watching markets . For those who made this transition later in life how did you actually learn and what does the realistic day to day look like once you know what youre doing"

      "selftext": "The US national debt has hit $38.4 trillion. For perspective, the combined valuation of the Magnificent Seven is approximately $21.7 trillion. The US government now owes nearly double the total value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined. The total amount of debt is not the primary issue. The real danger is the cost of servicing it. We are increasingly borrowing to pay interest on existing debt. This adds more debt to the system and steadily worsens the cycle. The Fiscal Reality: The math is simple but the politics are nearly impossible. To materially reduce the deficit, the government would have to: Cut entitlements or defense. Politically untouchable. Raise taxes significantly. To close the current $1.8 trillion deficit, the average taxpayer would need to pay roughly $11,700 more per year in additional federal taxes. With no credible path to balancing the budget, reducing the interest burden becomes the only realistic option. This creates strong incentives for lower rates and renewed liquidity support, even if inflation risks remain elevated. The Real Return Trap: The market, not the Fed alone, ultimately dictates the price of borrowing. If inflation runs at or above nominal yields, bondholders earn zero or negative real returns. To preserve purchasing power, investors demand higher yields. That raises borrowing costs across the entire economy. Mortgages, corporate loans, and business investment all become more expensive regardless of policy intent. The Slower Growth Reality: Higher borrowing costs flow directly to consumers. Since consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of US GDP, this creates a structural drag on growth. More income is diverted to debt servicing, leaving less discretionary spending to fuel expansion. Most investors have not priced in this shift. The Coming Shift: As the perceived risk free nature of US Treasuries weakens at the margin, capital will increasingly prioritize preservation. Over time, this favors markets with more sustainable debt levels and stronger fiscal trajectories. Moving before this adjustment becomes consensus may be necessary to protect real wealth. Read the full article (find it in other post, cannot post link in this subreddit) for a deeper breakdown of the mechanics and implications. I would recommend rotating into hard assets and value plays. If you are mostly in dollar denominated assets consider globally diversifying.",

The US government now owes nearly double the total value of its seven largest and most successful tech companies combined . The total amount of debt is not_the primary issue . The real danger is the cost of servicing it . We are increasingly borrowing to pay interest on existing debt . This adds more debt to the system and steadily worsens the cycle . The Fiscal Reality The math is simple but the politics are nearly impossible . To materially reduce the deficit the government would have to Cut entitlements or defense . Politically untouchable . Raise taxes significantly . To close the current $ 1.8 trillion deficit the average taxpayer would need to pay roughly $ 11700 more per year in additional federal taxes . With no_credible path to balancing the budget reducing the interest burden becomes the only realistic option . This creates strong incentives for lower rates and renewed liquidity support even if inflation risks remain elevated . The Real Return Trap The market not_the Fed alone ultimately dictates the price of borrowing . If inflation runs at or above nominal yields bondholders earn zero or negative real returns . To preserve purchasing power investors demand higher yields . That raises borrowing costs across the entire economy . Mortgages corporate loans and business investment all become more expensive regardless of policy intent . The Slower Growth Reality Higher borrowing costs flow directly to consumers . Since consumer spending accounts for nearly 70 percent of US GDP this creates a structural drag on growth . More income is diverted to debt servicing leaving less discretionary spending to fuel expansion . Most investors have not_priced in this shift . The Coming Shift As the perceived risk free nature of US Treasuries weakens at the margin capital will increasingly prioritize preservation . Over time this favors markets with more sustainable debt levels and stronger fiscal trajectories . Moving before this adjustment becomes consensus may be necessary to protect real wealth . Read the full article find it in other post can not post link in this subreddit for a deeper breakdown of the mechanics and implications . I would recommend rotating into hard assets and value plays . If you are mostly in dollar denominated assets consider globally diversifying ."

      "selftext": "Berkshire Hathaway remains a unique study in capital allocation and long-term value creation. Its diverse portfolio spans insurance, industrials, consumer goods, and equities, with a significant cash position that provides optionality in volatile markets. Given the company’s approach to underwriting float, share repurchases, and opportunistic acquisitions, I’m interested in discussing the fundamentals beyond the headline numbers. How are others modeling intrinsic value for Berkshire today? Are you focusing on normalized operating earnings, insurance float contribution, or the embedded optionality in publicly traded equity holdings? How do you weigh the potential upside from selective acquisitions against risks like interest rate exposure, regulatory constraints, or underperformance in cyclical segments? I’d also like to hear your thoughts on using metrics like adjusted book value, FCF yield, and ROIC as frameworks for evaluating the current attractiveness of BRK shares.",

So I've been using Joel Greenblatt's strategy from \"The Little Book That Beats the Market\" and figured I'd share some thoughts. The basic idea is pretty straightforward. You screen for stocks that are both high quality and cheap, then buy the top 30 to 50 names with equal weighting. Quality gets measured by return on invested capital, which tells you how efficiently a company uses its money to generate profits. Cheapness is determined by earnings yield, which is basically the inverse of the P/E ratio. You rank all stocks by both metrics and buy the ones that score best overall. I typically filter for companies with at least an S&P 500 level market cap because I don't want to mess around with tiny illiquid names. If your screener doesn't have ROIC, you can substitute return on assets or return on total capital and still capture the same general idea. The whole point is finding businesses that earn a lot on their capital but are trading at reasonable valuations. One thing Greenblatt emphasizes is that the strategy will underperform the market for stretches, sometimes for years. That's actually why it works over time. Most people bail when it lags and miss the eventual payoff. You can find the actual stock lists through various screeners online if you want to see what currently qualifies.",

      "selftext": "Back in the late 90s we had over 8000 listed companies, now its down to around 4000. Happened cuz regulations went nuts after Sarbanes-Oxley, small companies cant afford all the compliance crap. Private money is everywhere too, VCs and PE sitting on piles of cash so good startups just stay private forever. Big corps also scoop up the small public ones faster than new ones list. Now the huge growth happens behind closed doors. OpenAI talking raises that could hit 800B+ valuation, zero public shares. SpaceX already at 800B private. Same with Anthropic pushing 350B, Databricks 134B, all locked up. NVDA went public in 99 and retail could grab it dirt cheap, ride the whole way up. That doesnt happen anymore, the 100x part is private now. So hows retail supposed to get any edge these days? Secondary platforms, small cap hunting, venture funds if youre rich enough? Or we just stuck buying winners after they already 50xd private? What strategies you actually using? Serious answers only, skip the bitcoin jokes pls.",

      "title": "GRAIL ($GRAL) - Early cancer detection to grow in tens of multiples",
      "selftext": "$GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection, with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never solved well: catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear. Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw, many of which currently have no routine screening, and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales. The addressable market is enormous, and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation, regulatory progress, and payer acceptance. From a growth perspective, the key drivers are FDA approval pathways, Medicare reimbursement, and employer or health system adoption. Each of those acts as a step function for volume, not a linear ramp. Once reimbursement is secured, testing can move from discretionary to routine, which changes utilization overnight. Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness, and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators. Near term, GRAL remains volatile and news driven, which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale. Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM - on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials, timelines, or commercialization strategy. This is not a value stock or a trade on multiples, it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected. If Galleri becomes standard of care, today’s valuation will look small in hindsight. #biotech #fuckcancer #cancerdetection",

      "selftext_processed": "$ GRAL is a pure play on early cancer detection with its Galleri blood test targeting a problem the healthcare system has never_solved well catching multiple cancers before symptoms appear . Galleri can screen for dozens of cancers in a single blood draw many of which currently have no_routine screening and that alone puts it in a category with massive long term upside if adoption scales . The addressable market is enormous and success here is less about quarterly numbers and more about clinical validation regulatory progress and payer acceptance . From a growth perspective the key drivers are FDA approval pathways Medicare reimbursement and employer or health system adoption . Each of those acts as a step function for volume not_a linear ramp . Once reimbursement is secured testing can move from discretionary to routine which changes utilization overnight . Recent clinical data continues to support accuracy and real world usefulness and partnerships with healthcare systems help de risk the rollout while building credibility with payers and regulators . Near term GRAL remains volatile and news driven which is typical for high conviction healthcare names pre scale . Management presenting at major healthcare conferences like JPM on January 12th 2026 will likely keep the story in front of institutional capital and often precedes updates on trials timelines or commercialization strategy . This is not_a value stock or a trade on multiples it is a long duration growth bet on changing how cancer is detected . If Galleri becomes standard of care today ’ s valuation will look small in hindsight . biotech fuckcancer cancerdetection"

My current retirement fund is the C fund with TSP and I would like to mirror those options with my Fidelity investment . Im just unsure which option to choose . The c fund is 100 % stocks with the SP 500 . Honestly I dont really know what Im doing when it comes to investing which is why I originally wanted them to do it for me I just know that my TSP has been doing well and historically it does do well over time"

      "selftext": "Does a \"perfect\" brokerage actually exist? I’m currently split between M1 and Robinhood and it’s a massive headache. I’ve reached the point where I’m spread too thin and tracking everything on a manual spreadsheet just to see my actual allocation, which sucks. **The M1 side:** I love the \"Pie\" setup for organizing my long-term stuff, but I’m over the trading windows and the way their auto-investing works. If one of my high-conviction stocks starts ripping, M1’s \"dynamic rebalancing\" basically stops buying it because it’s now \"overweight.\" I want my recurring buys to stay at the fixed % I set (e.g., if I set 10% to Apple, I want 10% of every deposit to go there regardless of the current price). **The Robinhood side:** The UI is obviously great and I love being able to set limit orders for flash crashes or just buy instantly. But managing a \"custom index\" of 15+ stocks on there is a nightmare. I don't want to set 15 separate recurring buy orders and manually rebalance them every month. Basically, I want: 1. M1-style Pies/Baskets (for organization). 2. Fixed-ratio DCA (every $100 deposit splits exactly how I set it). 3. Instant execution / No trading windows. 4. A UI that doesn't feel like it was built in 1995. I’ve looked at Public and Fidelity Solo Baskets but haven't pulled the trigger. Has anyone found a platform that actually hits all of these? Or a way to consolidate this without it being a second job?",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I currently use both M1 and Robinhood. I both like and dislike both for different reasons, there has to be a platform that offers the best of both worlds... right? **The problem statement:** I love the flexibility and ease of use of Robinhood when it comes to investing in individual ETFs/Stocks, but it doesn't allow for an \"Easy\" way to make my own \"pie\" that I can DCA into. I love the ease of use and visual interface on M1 for making my personal basket or \"index\" that I DCA into on a recurring deposit, but it only has two times of day that a trade will complete, doesn't allow for fixed auto-recurring deposits (goes based off current weight relative to target weight), and some other restrictions. I love robinhood for index investing because the UI/UX is top-tier and I can just easily set recurring investments. I also love robinhood for individual stocks that I invest in on a conditions basis (certain price met, flash crash, etc...). I love M1 for making \"pies\" (basically my own index) that auto-invest based on target weight and my recurring deposits that are set to auto from my bank. The issue is, between these platforms and stragegies, and other aspects of my financial situation, I've spread myself too thin. Even just to rebalance my strategy takes too much time to check two apps, do calculations, track it on a separate spreadsheet bc I can't do it all in one place, etc.. Happy to hear others' experiences and would love any reccomendations, even if it's not a direct answer to my question!",

      "selftext": "MU just popped \\~4% on decent volume, and this feels more structural than your typical intra-day swing. The broader semiconductor group has been lagging AI “pure plays,” but memory names had been oversold relative to both Nvidia and the rest of the chip complex. Today’s strength suggests some rotation may finally be happening. There are a few catalysts behind this move: signs of improving memory pricing in channel checks, continued AI server demand, and technicals showing a break above short-term consolidation. MU isn’t cheap, but the market seems to be repricing the earnings outlook after digesting last quarter’s results. I’m thinking of holding and looking for disciplined pullbacks to add, not chasing at the top. Still curious whether this is the start of a sustained move or just relief in a choppy sector. What do others see in MU’s tape right now?",

The Wegovy^(®) pill is the first oral glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management. The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial^(2). In the OASIS 4 trial, oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6% mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities^(1). The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy^(®) pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy^(®) 2.4 mg. Furthermore, one in three people experienced 20% or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial^(1). The well-known safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy^(®) pill in the OASIS-4 trial, which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management. “The pill is here. With today's approval of the Wegovy^(®) pill, patients will have a convenient, once-daily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy^(®) injection,” said Mike Doustdar, president and CEO of Novo Nordisk. “As the first oral GLP-1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity, the Wegovy^(®) pill provides patients with a new, convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey. No other current oral GLP-1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy^(®) pill, and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US”. Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy^(®) pill in the US in early January 2026. Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg once-daily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025. How will the stock react? What do you think?",

The Wegovy® pill is the first oral glucagonlike peptide1 GLP1 receptor agonist therapy approved for weight management . The approval is based on the OASIS trial programme and the SELECT trial2 . In the OASIS 4 trial oral semaglutide 25 mg taken once daily demonstrated 16.6 % mean weight loss when treatment was adhered to in adult participants with obesity or overweight with one or more comorbidities1 . The weight loss achieved with the Wegovy® pill is similar to that of injectable Wegovy® 2.4 mg . Furthermore one in three people experienced 20 % or greater weight loss in the OASIS 4 trial1 . The wellknown safety and tolerability profile of semaglutide was reaffirmed with the Wegovy® pill in the OASIS4 trial which was comparable to previous trials with semaglutide for weight management . “ The pill is here . With todays approval of the Wegovy® pill patients will have a convenient oncedaily pill that can help them lose as much weight as the original Wegovy® injection ” said Mike Doustdar president and CEO of Novo Nordisk . “ As the first oral GLP1 treatment for people living with overweight or obesity the Wegovy® pill provides patients with a new convenient treatment option that can help patients start or continue their weight loss journey . No_other current oral GLP1 treatment can match the weight loss delivered by the Wegovy® pill and we are very excited for what this will mean for patients in the US ” . Novo Nordisk expects to launch the Wegovy® pill in the US in early January 2026 . Novo Nordisk has submitted oral semaglutide 25 mg oncedaily for obesity to the European Medicines Agency EMA and other regulatory authorities during the second half of 2025 .

      "selftext": "The recent pullback in ADBE looks more like a normal reset in sentiment and valuation rather than any real deterioration in the underlying business. The core fundamentals remain intact, with a stable subscription model, solid cash flow, and strong product stickiness. This is not a name that suddenly became structurally broken. That said, from a trading perspective, this is also not a high conviction entry yet. The short term trend is still weak, and recent bounces appear more corrective than driven by aggressive dip buying. Volume and price action suggest that larger players are still patient and not in a rush to re establish positions. For me, the right move here is not bottom fishing and not chasing short term strength. This is a wait and observe situation. I want to see selling pressure fully clear and price stabilize, or momentum meaningfully shift back in favor of buyers. Until then, keeping risk off the table is more important than forcing a trade.",

The core fundamentals remain intact with a stable subscription model solid cash flow and strong product stickiness . This is not_a name that suddenly became structurally broken . That said from a trading perspective this is also not_a high conviction entry yet . The short term trend is still weak and recent bounces appear more corrective than driven by aggressive dip buying . Volume and price action suggest that larger players are still patient and not_in a rush to re establish positions . For me the right move here is not_bottom fishing and not_chasing short term strength . This is a wait and observe situation . I want to see selling pressure fully clear and price stabilize or momentum meaningfully shift back in favor of buyers . Until then keeping risk off the table is more important than forcing a trade ."

Now assuming production ramps even marginally would these influence stock price? I believe Waymo is owned by google, zoox is amazon and tesla is tesla. The thing about Tesla regardless of what musk claims is that they dont have any fully autonomous robotaxis yet since they require a person in the driver's seat, in theory they could push an update and millions of cars would become autonomous overnight. Amazon is building a factory for zoox as well so I was wondering just how much they would affect tesla, google and Amazon over the next several years?

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Shares in Paramount Skydance (PSKY) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) spiked Monday after Larry Ellison, the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle (ORCL), agreed to personally backstop $40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramount's proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. >Paramount stock rose over 4%, while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5%. >In a securities filing Monday morning, Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellison's son, David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deal's financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discovery's board. Last week, the board rejected Paramount's offer in favor of Netflix's (NFLX) bid, arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line. >Paramount's announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not to revoke the trust or \"adversely transfer\" assets while negotiations remain open. >\"Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD. Our $30 per share, fully financed all-cash offer was on December 4th, and continues to be, the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders,\" David Ellison said in Paramount's press release. >\"Because of our commitment to investment and growth, our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders, as a catalyst for greater content production, greater theatrical output, and more consumer choice,\" he added. >Netflix stock fell over 1% Monday. >Warner Bros., led by media mogul David Zaslav, has become the target of a multi-round bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks. >In Paramount's previous proposal, which was rejected by WBD's board, David Ellison's company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $30 per share, all-cash acquisition valued at $108.4 billion. >The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinale's RedBird Capital would backstop \"100% of our equity commitments,\" or the $40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through, while Jared Kushner's investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to \"forgo any governance rights.\" Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid. >Larry Ellison's offer to personally backstop $40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. \"assert\\[ed\\] that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison,\" Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement. >Warner Bros.' mid-December rejection of Paramount's offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflix's proposal, which would see the streaming giant absorb WBD's streaming and studios division. Under Netflix's offer, the streaming giant, helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos, would bring Warner Bros.' film and TV studios, HBO, and HBO Max in-house. >Warner Bros.' other news, sports, and entertainment assets, in its \"global networks\" division, would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025. >However, that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns, already flagged by President Trump. A combined Netflix-Warner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity, according to data from JustWatch, which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Shares in Paramount Skydance PSKY and Warner Bros . Discovery WBD spiked Monday after Larry Ellison the centibillionaire founder and executive chairman of Oracle ORCL agreed to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in equity financing for Paramounts proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Paramount stock rose over 4 % while Warner Bros. shares rose by over 3.5 % . In a securities filing Monday morning Paramount Skydance — led by Larry Ellisons son David Ellison — said the elder Ellison had agreed to backstop the deals financing to assuage fears from Warner Bros. Discoverys board . Last week the board rejected Paramounts offer in favor of Netflixs NFLX bid arguing in part that Paramount is too undercapitalized to be able to get an acquisition across the finish line . Paramounts announcement on Monday stated that the Ellison family trust owns approximately 1.16 billion shares of Oracle common stock and that Larry Ellison had agreed not_to revoke the trust or adversely transfer assets while negotiations remain open . Paramount has repeatedly demonstrated its commitment to acquiring WBD . Our $ 30 per share fully financed allcash offer was on December 4th and continues to be the superior option to maximize value for WBD shareholders David Ellison said in Paramounts press release . Because of our commitment to investment and growth our acquisition will be superior for all WBD stakeholders as a catalyst for greater content production greater theatrical output and more consumer choice he added . Netflix stock fell over 1 % Monday . Warner Bros. led by media mogul David Zaslav has become the target of a multiround bidding war in recent weeks between Paramount and Netflix for the storied film studio and its collection of broadcast networks . In Paramounts previous proposal which was rejected by WBDs board David Ellisons company would acquire both Warner Bros. streaming and studios division and its linear networks division in a $ 30 per share allcash acquisition valued at $ 108.4 billion . The Ellison family and Gerry Cardinales RedBird Capital would backstop 100 % of our equity commitments or the $ 40.7 billion in equity required to push a deal through while Jared Kushners investment firm Affinity Partners and a cohort of Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds would also provide capital while agreeing to forgo any governance rights . Affinity later withdrew from the hostile takeover bid . Larry Ellisons offer to personally backstop $ 40.4 billion in financing comes after Warner Bros. asserted that the only fix would be a personal guarantee from Mr. Ellison Paramount said in its Monday morning announcement . Warner Bros. midDecember rejection of Paramounts offer appeared to tip the scales in favor of Netflixs proposal which would see the streaming giant absorb WBDs streaming and studios division . Under Netflixs offer the streaming giant helmed by CEO Ted Sarandos would bring Warner Bros. film and TV studios HBO and HBO Max inhouse . Warner Bros. other news sports and entertainment assets in its global networks division would be spun off into a separate public company called Discovery Global under a plan initially announced earlier in 2025 . However that deal would be likely to face antitrust concerns already flagged by President Trump . A combined NetflixWarner Bros. would control approximately a third of US streaming activity according to data from JustWatch which is likely to draw the attention of the Justice Department ."

      "selftext": "A lot of people say TSM is undervalued right now because of geopolitical risk. There’s no question TSM is a great company. But the market keeps focusing on worst-case scenarios, and I think it’s worth discussing whether that uncertainty is already being priced in too much. From a fundamentals perspective, TSM still has clear strengths in advanced process nodes, capital efficiency, global foundry market share, and pricing power. Its long-term competitive position hasn’t really changed. If geopolitical risk is something that’s always there but low probability, does today’s valuation actually offer a margin of safety? Or is this the kind of risk that shouldn’t be ignored at all? Curious to hear what others think is TSM undervalued here, or is the market pricing it fairly?",

From a fundamentals perspective TSM still has clear strengths in advanced process nodes capital efficiency global foundry market share and pricing power . Its longterm competitive position hasn ’ t really changed . If geopolitical risk is something that ’ s always there but low probability does today ’ s valuation actually offer a margin of safety Or is this the kind of risk that shouldn ’ t be ignored at all Curious to hear what others think is TSM undervalued here or is the market pricing it fairly"

      "selftext": "I’m just curious how overvalued the markets can get before a large crash (.com bubble). It feels difficult to correctly evaluate the tech sector, and find their true value. It just seemed the past 2 years (since October) everything is up 50%, all the way from minerals, to robotics, and now even quantum computing stocks. Majority of the quantum mechanics stocks were around $1-2, but now they’re pushing past $40+. It’s just insane to watch how much people refused to touch these sectors, until it was overvalued. So my question is, what sector still isn’t overvalued. And if every sector is overvalued, are we dooming ourselves for a crash?",

It feels difficult to correctly evaluate the tech sector and find their true value . It just seemed the past 2 years since October everything is up 50 % all the way from minerals to robotics and now even quantum computing stocks . Majority of the quantum mechanics stocks were around $ 12 but now they ’ re pushing past $ 40 . It ’ s just insane to watch how much people refused to touch these sectors until it was overvalued . So my question is what sector still isn ’ t overvalued . And if every sector is overvalued are we dooming ourselves for a crash"

      "selftext": "I've explained it once, but badly - if I don't collect my thoughts well in advance it's hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays. This post is the start of **my redemption ark (in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts)**, and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy \"LUNR tickets\" when it was trading at $8\\~ I've since then got an 800% gain on my options: [My position \\(not including the new one I just made\\)]( # It started with a message from a WSB discord user I'll forever love this dude, he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract, briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them. My initial thoughts were the typical \"yea right, buddy\" thoughts: * How do I know you're a mechanical/space/whatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA? * How can you be so sure, that they are the ones to get picked? * Have you even checked their financials? [My brain when I realized what I realized]( But then my ADHD-crippled-monkey inside my brain took over: * Wait, did you say only three companies selected? * Final stage of the contest? * Previous collaborations with NASA? * Wait, you told me that there's a probability two companies might make the cut? * $4.7Bln contract? This is a typical 'gambling' game, and every gambling game can be analyzed, simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge. You see I used to play poker, and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices. # Simple Gambling Math Note: To simplify the text and make it shorter, I'll denote probability as P(event). Imagine that you're playing a simple \"roll the 3-sided dice\" game. Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 1/3. Now say you're betting $1 on your favorite number and if you win, you get $1.5 back. You could calculate the EV (expected value) of this game by simply calculating: P(win) \\* amount(won) + P(loss) \\* - amount(loss) = your EV (of discrete probability) so in our sample game we have: 1/3 \\* $1.5 - 2/3 \\* $1 \\~= $-0,17 Roughly translated to human language -> In the long run, for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $0.17 If we can figure out how this \"LTV contract game\" is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not. # Monte Carlo Simulations Now here's what I was thinking, there's a lot of information out there, publicly available. That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision. So all I need to do is to \"define a game\" and the rules to play this game, run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability. Why do I need to do this? To be as independent as possible (and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way). **So this is the game:** You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end (1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked), you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability (random events). At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules you'll randomly select from the original set. At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule (/event) occurring (and you do so randomly). Run a lot of simulations -> assess conditional probabilities based on results, i.e.: **- P(LUNR win | IF 1 selected)** **- P(LUNR win | IF 2 selected)** Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering, space age boom, etc. everything slightly improving your odds. # Results Even if the chances that 1 company would've been selected, the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry (at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly \\~ 45c premium each). The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility, but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it, standard shares would just fall to a certain price. However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 1/2... meaning that it just didn't make sense \"not to play\" - even if you think they might lose. As of right now, if it wasn't made clear that 2 companies would get selected... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldn't pay off (or barely for that matter), mostly because the premiums are already high. However - NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies, to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in, making the calls still lucrative. Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning, further helping the \"narrative\" that this is a valuable play. **Trying to estimate a PT** The problem with companies such as LUNR is that it's increasingly hard to estimate a PT. One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap -> recalculating the price (it's not perfect, it's pretty inaccurate, but it gives you some kind of an estimate). If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $40 a share. I tend to use this number as \"the super-positive estimate\", I then take roughly 1/3 of it and declare it as the \"the super-pessimistic estimate\" .. i.e. $40 / 3 \\~= $13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $40/2 = $20 The middle ground is what I use as the \"average, regular estimate\" i.e. $30 \\----- So, rough estimates: **Super-positive estimate: $40+** **Average estimate: $30** **Pessimistic estimate: \\~$20** \\----- **Super-pessimistic estimate: $13.4** \\----- This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $12.5C. Current price - USD 16\\~",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive explained it once but badly if I dont collect my thoughts well in advance its hard to explain the reasoning behind certain plays . This post is the start of my redemption ark in terms of me being capable of explaining my thoughts and so I will try to explain once more but more carefully why I decided to buy LUNR tickets when it was trading at $ 8 Ive since then got an 800 % gain on my options My position not including the new one I just made It started with a message from a WSB discord user Ill forever love this dude he told me about LUNR and an LTV contract briefly explained why LUNR is going to win the contract and that he has invested into them . My initial thoughts were the typical yea right buddy thoughts How do I know youre a mechanicalspacewhatever engineer that actually understands what is required by NASA How can you be so sure that they are the ones to get picked Have you even checked their financials My brain when I realized what I realized But then my ADHDcrippledmonkey inside my brain took over Wait did you say only three companies selected Final stage of the contest Previous collaborations with NASA Wait you told me that theres a probability two companies might make the cut $ 4.7Bln contract This is a typical gambling game and every gambling game can be analyzed simulated and if you do it well enough you can get an edge . You see I used to play poker and when you want to analyze a hand you do similar techniques that banks use to predict stock market prices . Simple Gambling Math Note To simplify the text and make it shorter Ill denote probability as Pevent . Imagine that youre playing a simple roll the 3sided dice game . Each side has a probability of being rolled equal to 13 . Now say youre betting $ 1 on your favorite number and if you win you get $ 1.5 back . You could calculate the EV expected value of this game by simply calculating Pwin amountwon Ploss amountloss your EV of discrete probability so in our sample game we have 13 $ 1.5 23 $ 1 $ 017 Roughly translated to human language In the long run for every time you decided to play this game you effectively lost $ 0.17 If we can figure out how this LTV contract game is played and what are the individual probabilities then we can figure out if it makes sense to play this game or not_ Monte Carlo Simulations Now heres what I was thinking theres a lot of information out there publicly available . That allows me to guess what might get factored into this decision . So all I need to do is to define a game and the rules to play this game run simulations of this game and then approximate the likely probability . Why do I need to do this To be as independent as possible and factor in different odds of a decision being made this way . So this is the game You have 3 companies at the beginning and in the end 1 or with a certain probability 2 will be picked you have a set of rules where each rule defines which company scores points with what probability random events . At the start of the game you chose a number equal to the number of rules youll randomly select from the original set . At the start of each simulation you will modify the base probability of a rule event occurring and you do so randomly . Run a lot of simulations assess conditional probabilities based on results i.e . PLUNR win IF 1 selected PLUNR win IF 2 selected Now of course it gets even better if you start factoring the odds of the market recovering space age boom etc . everything slightly improving your odds . Results Even if the chances that 1 company wouldve been selected the odds were stacked in your favor as long as you were buying deep OTM calls with long expiry at the time I bought end of JAN 12.5C for roughly 45c premium each . The reason for this is that the leverage increases your volatility but as a result of that you can potentially lose everything you invested into it standard shares would just fall to a certain price . However when factoring the possibility of 2 companies being selected the eventual probability of LUNR winning became slightly greater than 12 ... meaning that it just didnt make sense not to play even if you think they might lose . As of right now if it wasnt made clear that 2 companies would get selected ... then buying the deep OTM calls wouldnt pay off or barely for that matter mostly because the premiums are already high . However NASA made clear that they have an intention of awarding two companies to diversify vendors and prevent vendor lock in making the calls still lucrative . Huge insider buying a month or so back also indicated larger odds of winning further helping the narrative that this is a valuable play . Trying to estimate a PT The problem with companies such as LUNR is that its increasingly hard to estimate a PT . One of the possible ways of trying to guess the potential price is to take the contracts that they signed and just add them to the market cap recalculating the price its not_perfect its pretty inaccurate but it gives you some kind of an estimate . If I just assume that the current price already factors in some of the 4.7B contract then with a mkt cap of around 4.7B you get $ 40 a share . I tend to use this number as the superpositive estimate I then take roughly 13 of it and declare it as the the superpessimistic estimate .. i.e . $ 40 3 $ 13.4 Pessimistic estimate set as $ 402 $ 20 The middle ground is what I use as the average regular estimate i.e . $ 30 So rough estimates Superpositive estimate $ 40 Average estimate $ 30 Pessimistic estimate $ 20 Superpessimistic estimate $ 13.4 This kinda makes it clear why I decided to go with $ 12.5C . Current price USD 16"

Is an 8% position in Google a reasonable long-term conviction, or does it cross the line into excessive concentration risk? Thanks EDIT, I hesitate between Google and Nvidia, so after it, I even thought about putting 5% in Google and 3% in Nvidia, but I figured I'd be shooting myself in the foot by cutting it in half...?",

      "title": "KSPI: WeChat / MELI style. Super-app in Kazakhstan, expanding in Turkey",
      "selftext": "Kaspi (KSPI) is Kazakhstan’s “super app”. It's similar to WeChat or to Amazon, Klarna bundled with other services (like messaging and Uber Eat) combined. The app is made of three components: * **Payments**: payment processing + analytics for consumers/merchants. Ex: 1.1M of transactions for restaurant (73x from 4Q'24 to 3Q'25). * **Marketplace**: connects buyers/sellers with omni-channel commerce. Like Amzn, they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace (+56% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25). The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases (+36% from 3Q'24 to 3Q'25) * **Fintech**: BNPL, finance, savings inside the Kaspi app. Other than innovations like pay with palm, financing (micro credit) is their fastest growing product (+17%) with 40% being Buy Now Pay Later. Both Savings and Revenues are increasing (double digits). Kaspi also has an e-Grocery line (1.3M consumers. +53% YoY) and recently integrated Glovo. They use AI to enrich content, which translates into improved profitability. Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales. In short, Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly. They have a clear dominant position, and given the network effects, I would qualify it as a moat. In terms of profitability vs price. Metrics appear exceptional for a consumer-facing platform: * Operating margin: 51.3% * ROE: 66.9% * FCF yield: 9.5% * P/E: 6.9 (market cap \\~15B) \\+ Kaspi just approved a $100M buyback in November 2025. In terms of governance, the company is still cofounder-led with: * Mikheil Lomtadze (CEO) 22.51% * Vyacheslav Kim (Chairman) 21.2% * Management has 3.9% Most importantly, the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS (customer focus) - a bit like Amazon. What brought the stock price down? Mostly two reasons: 1. There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago. In brief, it ties Kaspi to Russia, suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US. Kaspi has replied to the claims. Stock went from \\~$120 before the report to \\~$77 today. 2. Macro + Sector: The local interest rates are very high (base rate is \\~16%), smartphones sales are decreasing, and like with all banks, there are concerns with their loans health. **Uncertainty:** Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local e-commerce player (Hepsiburada 2025). Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license. Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign (higher CTR) and continued growth, but M&A + new market means risk. Finally, KZ regulatory/tax risks are real, and geopolitical uncertainty exists. I believe the president (Kassym-Jomart Tokayev) is a tailwind for increased transparency, liberalism, and a balanced relationship with Russia. In addition, despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakh's claim to nationhood, I doubt Russia can afford another military front - especially under a new narrative. On the other hand, FDI are positive again. I am bullish on Kaspi's development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia. Disclaimer: This is not investment advice. I opened a long position on 19/12/2025.",

      "selftext_processed": "Kaspi KSPI is Kazakhstan ’ s “ super app ” . Its similar to WeChat or to Amazon Klarna bundled with other services like messaging and Uber Eat combined . The app is made of three components Payments payment processing analytics for consumersmerchants . Ex 1.1M of transactions for restaurant 73x from 4Q24 to 3Q25 . Marketplace connects buyerssellers with omnichannel commerce . Like Amzn they are also growing their advertising revenues rapidly on the marketplace 56 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 . The marketplace itself saw 83.7M purchases 36 % from 3Q24 to 3Q25 Fintech BNPL finance savings inside the Kaspi app . Other than innovations like pay with palm financing micro credit is their fastest growing product 17 % with 40 % being Buy Now Pay Later . Both Savings and Revenues are increasing double digits . Kaspi also has an eGrocery line 1.3M consumers . 53 % YoY and recently integrated Glovo . They use AI to enrich content which translates into improved profitability . Kaspi Ai creates more attractive descriptions and they track the impact with CTR and sales . In short Kaspi innovates and executes brilliantly . They have a clear dominant position and given the network effects I would qualify it as a moat . In terms of profitability vs price . Metrics appear exceptional for a consumerfacing platform Operating margin 51.3 % ROE 66.9 % FCF yield 9.5 % PE 6.9 market cap 15B Kaspi just approved a $ 100M buyback in November 2025 . In terms of governance the company is still cofounderled with Mikheil Lomtadze CEO 22.51 % Vyacheslav Kim Chairman 21.2 % Management has 3.9 % Most importantly the culture was built from the ground up with an obsession on the NPS customer focus a bit like Amazon . What brought the stock price down Mostly two reasons 1 . There was a short report made by Culper Research a bit more than a year ago . In brief it ties Kaspi to Russia suggests dealmaking and possible sanctions from the US . Kaspi has replied to the claims . Stock went from $ 120 before the report to $ 77 today . 2 . Macro Sector The local interest rates are very high base rate is 16 % smartphones sales are decreasing and like with all banks there are concerns with their loans health . Uncertainty Kapsi expanded into Turkey with the acquisition of a local ecommerce player Hepsiburada 2025 . Kaspi appears to replicate what it did in Kazakhstan and is in the process of getting a local bank license . Their Q3 report indicates successes with UX redesign higher CTR and continued growth but MA new market means risk . Finally KZ regulatorytax risks are real and geopolitical uncertainty exists . I believe the president KassymJomart Tokayev is a tailwind for increased transparency liberalism and a balanced relationship with Russia . In addition despite some Russian rhetoric that questions the Kazakhs claim to nationhood I doubt Russia can afford another military front especially under a new narrative . On the other hand FDI are positive again . I am bullish on Kaspis development in Turkey and continued success in Kazakhstan and Central Asia . Disclaimer This is not_investment advice . I opened a long position on 19122025 ."

      "selftext": "I keep seeing YouTube stock analysts say “just spin Starlink and it’ll get a better multiple.” Maybe. I just think the bigger reason is the structure. (Earlier reports: [SpaceX has started bank talks for a potential IPO.]( Starlink is the part with a solid cash-flow story, whereas the rest of SpaceX is still a massive capex burn. Splitting them makes the narrative easier to sell and gives insiders an easier liquidity path. It avoids putting the entire SpaceX bundle under constant public-market pressure. The risk is it might lose the space halo and get priced like a telecom. Then the whole debate becomes ARPU, churn, and terminal subsidies.",

Earlier reports SpaceX has started bank talks for a potential IPO . Starlink is the part with a solid cashflow story whereas the rest of SpaceX is still a massive capex burn . Splitting them makes the narrative easier to sell and gives insiders an easier liquidity path . It avoids putting the entire SpaceX bundle under constant publicmarket pressure . The risk is it might lose the space halo and get priced like a telecom . Then the whole debate becomes ARPU churn and terminal subsidies ."

      "selftext": "I’m currently evaluating the possibility of taking a position in Roblox Corporation (RBLX) and thought I could walk through my thought process. Over the last couple of days, I’ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying long-term value. Fundamentally, the stock has been under a lot of pressure, and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion. The engagement and retention figures are great, and the user base is growing steadily. The company is currently operating at a loss; however, it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases. In my opinion, this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years. I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors. The shares have been affected by some macro trends, such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks, as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability. A number of these risks are valid, such as volatility, regulatory risks, and competition, although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion. From a valuation and technical perspective, this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profit-driven growth exist. Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth, monetization gains, and scalability, I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue. The market conditions are also conducive for steady accumulation, which suits my investment strategy. In summary, my personal investment view is based on fundamentals, growth potential, operating leverage, market sentiment, and risk-adjusted valuations. Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side, I do believe in the potential for extended-term growth which currently is not factored in by the stock price. My strategy would be to gradually build positions, hold positions for 3–5 years, and keep a strict watch on important growth & profitability metrics. This is my POV, I just wanna know what I am evaluating is based on facts or I have some prejudice for RBLX, or am I missing something ???",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m currently evaluating the possibility of taking a position in Roblox Corporation RBLX and thought I could walk through my thought process . Over the last couple of days I ’ ve taken the time to analyze the company data and attempt to determine if its current share price accurately reflects its underlying longterm value . Fundamentally the stock has been under a lot of pressure and this presents a great point of entry in my opinion . The engagement and retention figures are great and the user base is growing steadily . The company is currently operating at a loss however it seems likely that it will be able to harness the power of operating leverage to significantly improve margins as the monetization of the business increases . In my opinion this is one of the main catalysts for the stock to unlock substantial upside in the next 3–5 years . I also analyzed market sentiment and risk factors . The shares have been affected by some macro trends such as high interest rates and underperformance in growth stocks as well as doubts in the market concerning timelines for growth and profitability . A number of these risks are valid such as volatility regulatory risks and competition although I think they are underestimating the associated upside with revenue acceleration and margin expansion . From a valuation and technical perspective this stock is currently being priced below where its prospects for scalability and profitdriven growth exist . Based on a model outlook that factors revenue growth monetization gains and scalability I personally feel this stock has the potential for outstanding gains if such trends continue . The market conditions are also conducive for steady accumulation which suits my investment strategy . In summary my personal investment view is based on fundamentals growth potential operating leverage market sentiment and riskadjusted valuations . Although there do exist potential risks on the negative side I do believe in the potential for extendedterm growth which currently is not_factored in by the stock price . My strategy would be to gradually build positions hold positions for 3–5 years and keep a strict watch on important growth profitability metrics . This is my POV I just wan na know what I am evaluating is based on facts or I have some prejudice for RBLX or am I missing something"

More than double the S&P 500's return of 16.20% this year! In 2024, Reddit's Dark Horse thread picks also more than doubled the S&P 500! The Dark Horse Stocks mentioned in the thread returned 50.92% , and the S&P 500's returned 23.92% that year. I would like to pose the question again for 2026 and see if Wallstreetbets can beat the S&P 500 for the third year in a row. I will compile a list based on the most upvoted comments based on this thread and post results New Years Eve. What are your top Dark Horse Picks for 2026? Which stocks, that nobody thinks will do good, will do the best in 2026? Stocks that will rise from the dead and take us on a ride. Stocks that people count out. Stocks that are beaten down. Which stocks will make the biggest comebacks in 2026? Results as of 12/25/25: 1. RDDT : 299 upvotes 2. A S T S : 238 upvotes 3. NBIS : 227 upvotes 4. ONDS : 162 upvotes 5. AMZN : 154 upvotes 6.

Arguably the largest economy and market going down will dwindle down to wreck other markets directly or indirectly. It would be chaos. Is it time we suggest bonds to 23 year olds? (Joking). Obviously if I or anyone else knew how this thing goes, we wouldn’t need to worry. Just seems like a hard feat to ask people under the age of 30, to sell their shares in the S&P and hold bonds/cash when inflation is already wrecking your cash. Crazy times for sure, but wanted to see if anyone thought the same.",

Same feeling of “this is taking off.” But one is the beginning of a run. The other is the last gasp before it dumps. They’re visually identical. That’s the problem. The way I’ve found to tell them apart: Watch what happens in the 2-3 days AFTER the breakout. If volume stays high → probably realIf volume collapses → probably a trap The breakout itself won’t tell you. You have to wait and see if anyone actually shows up after the initial spike. Got burned on this so many times before I figured it out.",

      "selftext": "Micron Technology (MU) reported Q1 2026 results last Wednesday. Revenue of $13.6 billion was up 57% from Q1 2025. Operating income of $6.1 billion was up 45% from Q1 2025. The growth was partly from strong demand in its Cloud Memory business unit, where revenue increased 100% year-over-year. Management provided Q2 revenue guidance of $18.7 billion, or 37% quarter-over-quarter growth. For the full fiscal year, the average forecast of 30 Wall Street analysts, as reported in Yahoo Finance, is $73.8 billion, or 97% year-over-year growth. I created a valuation analysis model to see if MU could be a good Buy: [MU Valuation Analysis]( Adding the projected revenue growth and trailing operating margin provides 130 Value Points. My minimum required Value Points is 40, which represents the top 15% of publicly traded stocks. The current Enterprise Value of MU is $300.2 billion, based on Friday’s closing stock price of $265.92. This is 12.7 times the projected operating income of $23.6 billion. My Value Score calculation is 130/12.7, or 10.2. My minimum required Value Score for a Buy consideration is 2.0. Given MU’s growing capital expenditure investments, I replaced operating income with unlevered free cash flow in the model. The adjusted Value Score came in at 5.5, still solidly in Buy territory. MU looks like a strong Buy to me, and I bought some shares on Thursday. As always, please do your own research before making any investment decision.",

      "selftext": "Hi, I've been throwing money at a 401k since I turned 18 and, even with maxing out contributions, am not exactly where I think I should be so I'm turning my sights elsewhere, namely my rainy day fund. I have two accounts, one for true \"oh shit\" moments ($10k) and the other in case I get laid off since I'm in tech ($40k). The $40k I have is in a HYSA at 3.3% that I haven't had to look at even remotely (knocking on wood). A thread here caught my eye asking about the catch of investing in SPY and it doesn't really seem like there is one. At this point, since I have a true emergency fund, would it be better to pull everything out of my HYSA and invest it into SPY or something else for the long-run? To throw a little wrench into things, I also have this weird feeling that shit is **really** going to hit the fan soon here in the US economically but I've been comically wrong so far. I've been a lurker here on and off for some time and I'm well aware that trying to time the market is almost 100% of the time a losing endeavor but I'm not sure if there's anything on the horizon that might be a catalyst that I should wait for. If I should keep it parked in a HYSA and just mess around with where my 401k is invested I'm a-okay with that, or if it would be smart to start looking at overseas Index funds I can do that too. Just not exactly sure where to go and looking for guidance. Thanks! Edit: Thanks, realize this should be in not only Personal Finance but I'm going to keep these funds as a true combined emergency fund and invest everything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi Ive been throwing money at a 401k since I turned 18 and even with maxing out contributions am not_exactly where I think I should be so Im turning my sights elsewhere namely my rainy day fund . I have two accounts one for true oh shit moments $ 10k and the other in case I get laid off since Im in tech $ 40k . The $ 40k I have is in a HYSA at 3.3 % that I havent had to look at even remotely knocking on wood . A thread here caught my eye asking about the catch of investing in SPY and it doesnt really seem like there is one . At this point since I have a true emergency fund would it be better to pull everything out of my HYSA and invest it into SPY or something else for the longrun To throw a little wrench into things I also have this weird feeling that shit is really going to hit the fan soon here in the US economically but Ive been comically wrong so far . Ive been a lurker here on and off for some time and Im well aware that trying to time the market is almost 100 % of the time a losing endeavor but Im not_sure if theres anything on the horizon that might be a catalyst that I should wait for . If I should keep it parked in a HYSA and just mess around with where my 401k is invested Im aokay with that or if it would be smart to start looking at overseas Index funds I can do that too . Just not_exactly sure where to go and looking for guidance . Thanks Edit Thanks realize this should be in not_only Personal Finance but Im going to keep these funds as a true combined emergency fund and invest everything else ."

The first day or two was a little disheartening, but it didn't go too deep in the red since the option had about 3 months left. Because the theta was negligible I decided to hold on to it for a few weeks. Soon enough, the reversal happened and the position gradually slipped into green territory.

      "selftext": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as I'm reading the posts, the majority are already sitting on $500k, $1.5 million or more. Great! I'm happy for them but to the average person who doesn't make over $100k a year, how can one achieve this? It's never too late to start investing, I fully understand the concept. Are ETFs the answer? I read something that said at the age of 40, I would need to invest $4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably. If I put $4k a month into investing I'd be living on the street and the family would go hungry. Is the move to gamble on a penny stock? I'm just genuinely curious to see what others would do. We can't turn back the clock and start investing young. What's the play? Thank you *Edit- Reading through the comments, there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts. I'm thinking that outside of an RRSP (I'm in Canada), possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada. I will continue to read the comments and take some time to learn about some things being mentioned.",

      "selftext_processed": "So I see a lot of posts with people asking about retirement investment moves and as Im reading the posts the majority are already sitting on $ 500k $ 1.5 million or more . Great Im happy for them but to the average person who doesnt make over $ 100k a year how can one achieve this Its never_too late to start investing I fully understand the concept . Are ETFs the answer I read something that said at the age of 40 I would need to invest $ 4k a month to reach retirement and live comfortably . If I put $ 4k a month into investing Id be living on the street and the family would go hungry . Is the move to gamble on a penny stock Im just genuinely curious to see what others would do . We cant turn back the clock and start investing young . Whats the play Thank you Edit Reading through the comments there is some great insight and I do appreciate the time some of you are taking to share your thoughts . Im thinking that outside of an RRSP Im in Canada possibly an ETF such as XEQT or VEQT may be best suited for my situation as I am in Canada . I will continue to read the comments and take some time to learn about some things being mentioned ."

      "selftext": "This one will likely go over this sub’s collective head, but I’d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years. I’ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently (6 stocks now account for 80% of my port) and $PCT became one of my large long term bets (was a smaller position before) after the recent selloff, after what was a positive earnings call, that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff + shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock. IMO this should hopefully be my best most “boring” multi bagger in my long term portfolio. For those unfamiliar, PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin, that is essentially as good as virgin plastic. Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years, but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton, Ohio plant. That plant is the “proof” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product. Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta, GA and the 3 other planned international plants (more planned for the future). PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online, those plants are already spoken for. Making big enterprise decisions don’t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves. I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with P&G, so this is not just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked. I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side. Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they’re not going to want to place orders until they are certain it’s officially designated as a “recycled” material. Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term. Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not enough supply to meet their demand. Thus, these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $.80/lb. This means that PCT will not only be able to meet a supply/demand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is in-line with what these companies are spending on credits already. PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board, Val Mars, who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling. MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose. Any future partnerships with MARS aside, upon joining the board, Val was quoted saying “It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life. As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth”. From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder, this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar (ATT executive) joined their board and was a big source of credibility/validity to the market. The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo. When proven out, which should hopefully not be too long, all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling. Some future potential valuation thoughts: After the Augusta plant is operational, they could be doing as much as $1/lb in EBITDA. If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 25-30x. That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 (Ironton, Augusta, Thailand, Antwerp), PCT is potentially a $25/30 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 20-30 bln lbs per year. TLDR: One of the old school SPACS that’s actually a real company, but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast aside/low volume ignored. They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon. If they execute their vision I can see this being a 10-20X from the current $1.5B MC valuation within the next 3-5ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 25-50X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned. They’re a green, US company, so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well. I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn’t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well.

      "selftext_processed": "This one will likely go over this sub ’ s collective head but I ’ d like to briefly highlight what I believe can become one of the best industrial growth companies in the market over the next 5ish years . I ’ ve been consolidating into my highest convictions recently 6 stocks now account for 80 % of my port and $ PCT became one of my large long term bets was a smaller position before after the recent selloff after what was a positive earnings call that mostly driven by the recent high beta selloff shorts ability to press down the price of a lower volume traded stock . IMO this should hopefully be my best most “ boring ” multi bagger in my long term portfolio . For those unfamiliar PureCycle is a company focused on commercializing their patented recycling technology that turns waste polypropylene into ultra pure recycled resin that is essentially as good as virgin plastic . Their stock has been on a roller coaster the last few years but they have been quietly building out and ramping up their Ironton Ohio plant . That plant is the “ proof ” for the number of large customers currently doing trials and evaluating product . Customers are also currently positioning themselves for future capacity tied to the Augusta GA and the 3 other planned international plants more planned for the future . PCT is currently supporting trials so that by the time Asia and Europe come online those plants are already spoken for . Making big enterprise decisions don ’ t happen overnight and all of PCTs large customers are going through the standard processes to trial and verify the product for themselves . I should also state that PCT has a longstanding relationship with PG so this is not_just a small company that has been developing a rogue new technology unchecked . I believe one of the larger current overhangs is on the regulatory side . Large customers are waiting for that to officially clear before placing their POs because they ’ re not_going to want to place orders until they are certain it ’ s officially designated as a “ recycled ” material . Progress is being made there and should hopefully see resolution in the short term . Lots of companies already have sustainability mandates but there is not_enough supply to meet their demand . Thus these companies currently have to spend that money on credits that cost up to $ .80lb . This means that PCT will not_only be able to meet a supplydemand gap but also potentially provide pricing that is inline with what these companies are spending on credits already . PCT also recently added a tremendous resource to their board Val Mars who is the 4th generation previous executive of the largest candy company in the world whose company culture has been leaning heavily into sustainable recycling . MARS could sell out the entire Ironton facility on their own if they so chose . Any future partnerships with MARS aside upon joining the board Val was quoted saying “ It was great to witness sustainability in action at the Ironton Facility and to see how this innovative technology can give curbside waste a new life . As a champion of sustainability I look forward to helping guide PureCycle into the next phase of their growth ” . From a personal standpoint as a long term AST holder this reminds me of the early days when Chris Sambar ATT executive joined their board and was a big source of credibilityvalidity to the market . The Ironton plant is really the overall thesis maker right now imo . When proven out which should hopefully not_be too long all the future plants will simply be pit stops on their way to massive scaling . Some future potential valuation thoughts After the Augusta plant is operational they could be doing as much as $ 1lb in EBITDA . If the company is selling over 1 billion lbs then we can fairly assume a multiple of 2530x . That would mean that with just the 4 plants expected operational by 2030 Ironton Augusta Thailand Antwerp PCT is potentially a $ 2530 billion company with a roadmap to recycling as much as 2030 bln lbs per year . TLDR One of the old school SPACS that ’ s actually a real company but like many old SPACS it is hated and cast asidelow volume ignored . They are in the late innings of proving out the thesis and hopefully closing regulatory hurdles soon . If they execute their vision I can see this being a 1020X from the current $ 1.5B MC valuation within the next 35ish years and if you squint hard enough I can almost see a world where it is 2550X from here if the entire roadmap works out as planned . They ’ re a green US company so the politics should be favorable in the long run as well . I think just longing shares is best as the options chain doesn ’ t have much volume but I do have a small 2026 call position open as well . Best of luck out there regards 10500 shares 40 x 326 calls “ Think left and think right think low and think high oh the thinks you can think up if only you try ” Dr Seuss"

I am thinking of it more as a sabbatical than early retirement since I plan to work again in the next few years. So far I have been DCA’ing into the following portfolio and holding the bulk of the money in SGOV. I know I have some overlap in ETF underlying holdings, open to feedback on the portfolio as well. My question is how should I approach entering the market right now? Should I continue to DCA, lump sum it, or some hybrid approach? My worry is a drastic market pullback. I know time in the market beats timing the market but when I’m going to rely on the money for the next year or two how do you think about that in safety terms. Finally, I plan to speak with a financial planner as well but figure I would poll the hive mind of Reddit. Thanks in advance.

      "selftext": "As the title suggests, I'm currently only investing in Index Funds VWRP & VUAG. At the moment I only have 22k in VUAG and 10k in VWRP but plan to go 100% VWRP going forward as there's already 60% overlap towards US. I'm based in the UK, investing in a Stocks ISA with trading 212 and have currently maxed out my ISA allowance this year. As I'm also invested into a Lifetime ISA, I'm therefore only limited to 16k per year towards Stocks but wondered if my portfolio is good for long term growth & returns or if I should add individual stocks to get higher returns? At the moment I've got a \"set and forget\" approach - ideally aiming for an earlier retirement at 55-60 years old but have started reading & listening to more things stock market related.",

At the moment I only have 22k in VUAG and 10k in VWRP but plan to go 100 % VWRP going forward as theres already 60 % overlap towards US . Im based in the UK investing in a Stocks ISA with trading 212 and have currently maxed out my ISA allowance this year . As Im also invested into a Lifetime ISA Im therefore only limited to 16k per year towards Stocks but wondered if my portfolio is good for long term growth returns or if I should add individual stocks to get higher returns At the moment Ive got a set and forget approach ideally aiming for an earlier retirement at 5560 years old but have started reading listening to more things stock market related ."

      "selftext": "TL;DR: RuneScape bond prices might predict S&P 500 movements 7 weeks in advance (r=0.43, p<0.001). Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets. This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the world's most elaborate coincidence. Further research needed. # Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and S&P 500 performance between Dec. 2020 - Dec. 2025. The data suggests something unexpected: virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes. RS3 bond price movements consistently lead S&P 500 changes by approximately 49 days, suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets. # Methods **Data Processing Steps:** 1. Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds (via WeirdGloop API) and S&P 500 (via quantmod) 2. Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3. Returns calculated as percentage changes: r\\_t = (P\\_t / P\\_(t-1) - 1) × 100 4. Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5. Normalization performed using min-max scaling for visualization # Results **Key Findings:** * RS3 bond price movements consistently precede S&P 500 changes by 49 days (r = 0.428, p < 0.001) * Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022, suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature * RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the S&P 500 (daily SD: 2.35% vs 1.09%) * This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive early-warning system for broader economic sentiment shifts [Normalized 90-day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading S&P 500 movements by approximately49 days.]( [Cross-correlation function revealing peak correlation at -49-day lag, indicating RS3 bonds leadS&P 500 by 49 days.]( [30-day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive early-warning system.]( The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship **strengthened significantly post-2022**, potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior. [90-day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time.]( Both markets exhibit fat-tailed distributions, with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails. This amplification of sentiment signals, combined with the 49-day lead time, creates a potentially valuable early warning system. [Distribution of daily returns showing RS3’s fat-tailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator.]( # Trading Strategy Based on these trends, the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data: **BUY Signal (Increase S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average increases by ≥3% * Action: Begin accumulating S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 * Success Rate: 63.3% (based on historical backtesting) **SELL Signal (Reduce S&P 500 Exposure):** * When: RS3 bond 30-day moving average decreases by ≥3% * Action: Begin reducing S&P 500 exposure starting 10-20 days after RS3 signal * Expected Outcome: S&P 500 likely to decline around Day 49 * Success Rate: 39.1% (inverse - signals to avoid market) **HOLD Signal:** * When: RS3 bond moves less than ±3% over 30 days * Action: Maintain current allocation * Rationale: Insufficient signal strength # Software and Environment **Core Tools:** * R 4.3.0 * R Markdown * XeLaTeX * Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance **R Packages:** * quantmod * tidyverse * jsonlite * lubridate * zoo * ggplot2 * gridExtra * httr * knitr * kableExtra * scales",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR RuneScape bond prices might predict SP 500 movements 7 weeks in advance r0.43 p0.001 . Virtual economies may capture consumer sentiment shifts before traditional markets . This is either a fascinating alternative data source or the worlds most elaborate coincidence . Further research needed . Introduction I analyzed the relationship between RS3 bond prices and SP 500 performance between Dec. 2020 Dec. 2025 . The data suggests something unexpected virtual economy movements may actually predict traditional stock market changes . RS3 bond price movements consistently lead SP 500 changes by approximately 49 days suggesting that virtual economies might capture early signals of consumer sentiment before they appear in traditional markets . Methods Data Processing Steps 1 . Daily price data extracted for both RuneScape 3 bonds via WeirdGloop API and SP 500 via quantmod 2 . Inner join performed to ensure date alignment 3 . Returns calculated as percentage changes r_t P_t P_t1 1 × 100 4 . Rolling windows applied for trend and volatility calculations 5 . Normalization performed using minmax scaling for visualization Results Key Findings RS3 bond price movements consistently precede SP 500 changes by 49 days r 0.428 p 0.001 Predictive relationship has strengthened since 2022 suggesting increasing reliability as virtual economies mature RS3 economy is 2.2x more volatile than the SP 500 daily SD 2.35 % vs 1.09 % This higher volatility may make RS3 a more sensitive earlywarning system for broader economic sentiment shifts Normalized 90day moving averages showing RS3 bonds leading SP 500 movements by approximately49 days . Crosscorrelation function revealing peak correlation at 49day lag indicating RS3 bonds leadSP 500 by 49 days . 30day rolling volatility showing virtual economy as a more sensitive earlywarning system . The rolling correlation analysis shows that this predictive relationship strengthened significantly post2022 potentially due to growing integration of gaming into mainstream consumer behavior . 90day rolling correlation showing strengthening predictive relationship over time . Both markets exhibit fattailed distributions with RS3 bonds showing significantly wider tails . This amplification of sentiment signals combined with the 49day lead time creates a potentially valuable early warning system . Distribution of daily returns showing RS3 ’ s fattailed nature as an amplified sentiment indicator . Trading Strategy Based on these trends the report outlines specific signal rules for portfolio positioning using RS3 data BUY Signal Increase SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average increases by ≥3 % Action Begin accumulating SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to appreciate around Day 49 Success Rate 63.3 % based on historical backtesting SELL Signal Reduce SP 500 Exposure When RS3 bond 30day moving average decreases by ≥3 % Action Begin reducing SP 500 exposure starting 1020 days after RS3 signal Expected Outcome SP 500 likely to decline around Day 49 Success Rate 39.1 % inverse signals to avoid market HOLD Signal When RS3 bond moves less than ±3 % over 30 days Action Maintain current allocation Rationale Insufficient signal strength Software and Environment Core Tools R 4.3.0 R Markdown XeLaTeX Claude Sonnet 4.5 for coding assistance R Packages quantmod tidyverse jsonlite lubridate zoo ggplot2 gridExtra httr knitr kableExtra scales"

Con artist is winning this one . This isn ’ t a revolutionary tech company curing diseases or printing money with AI it ’ s a used car dealer with a website a mountain of debt and customers who is already poor and defaults for shits and giggles . Cooked books and the stock like a stonk meme possessed by gamma and shortcovering . IV is screaming that something chaotic is coming used car prices aren ’ t magic and the whole thing feels held together by optimism and duct tape . Also historically whenever I short something it immediately goes higher which means statistically I am now extremely due . Not_financial advice just a bear who looked at the chart looked at the fundamentals and said “ yeah… no_way this ends calmly"
