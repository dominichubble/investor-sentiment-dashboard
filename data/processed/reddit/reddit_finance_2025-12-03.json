      "selftext": "Hello all! My parents are ~65 and probably have another 7–10 years of earning ahead of them. They just inherited ~$500k and want to invest it gradually over the next 12–16 months. They don’t need the money right now and are comfortable with market volatility. Their goal is basically S&P-500-level returns with a little diversification. They recently opened a Schwab brokerage account and were told by a financial advisor that they “should” sign with him. We’re not sure that’s necessary since they’re leaning toward a simple, low-fee, ETF-based plan and dollar-cost averaging $5–10k per week. Here’s the rough allocation we’re considering: U.S. Large Cap (S&P-ish): SCHX – 40% Total U.S. Market: SCHB – 30% Developed International: SCHF – 10% Emerging Markets: SCHE – 5% U.S. Bonds: SCHZ – 10% TIPS: SCHP – 5% All funds have low expense ratios and can be automated at Schwab. Questions: 1. Does this allocation make sense for people in their mid-60s who don’t need the money immediately? 2. Any pitfalls or nuances with this setup (ETF vs mutual fund, tax considerations, rebalancing, etc.)? 3. Would a simpler one-fund option (like SWANX/SWYNX) be more appropriate? 4. Is hiring a financial advisor here actually necessary, or is this straightforward enough to DIY? Thanks in advance for any input.",

I want to get a line-of-credit loan of perhaps $150K, that I plan on paying off from an inherited Roth distribution (where I have about $700K) whenever I feel like it's time to ring the register on some position there. Even though I would love to ring the register on some of those positions that are now (or soon will be) long-term unrealized gains, because I want to keep my ACA MAGI income at 150% of poverty to get a heavily subsidized Silver-94% plan, I can't extract the gains (indeed, some of these gains are 6X, so most of the proceeds would be gains), and so they are basically frozen until I get on Medicare (i.e., the combination of the lowered subsidies from an increase in income past 150% would be equivalent to a 25% implicit tax rate). (I could retain the income in the Trust, but that would be at a 23.8% haircut - 20% long-term cap-gains + 3.8% ACA tax - oh, the irony, LOL) If it matters, this $150K is to be used to pay for construction of a house (for my personal residence use) on a property that the Trust owns. I could just simply extract the cash in a regular margin from Schwab, but the interest rate is ridiculous (like 11%). I think the margin is at IBKR is around 5.25%, but I wonder if I can have a Trust account there, as well as them having not-so-good service - although since I wouldn't be doing much, I guess it wouldn't be a big thing. Any transfer would be to my Trust non-IRA (actually checking account associated with the Trust non-IRA) at Schwab, which is the account that I would be using to spend the money. I was talking to a friend of mine that has some assets at USB, and he got something like 6% on a loan (although this wasn't a Trust account) - and so I was thinking that some big bank might be in a better situation to give me a better loan. I would tend to think that since this would be a loan with the Trust as the borrower, my own financial situation is irrelevant (for the record, my credit score is A+, but of course, my official income is very low, LOL).",

      "selftext": "Arvind Krishna, CEO of IBM, has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AI-data centers is economically unrealistic. On the “Decoder” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a one-gigawatt AI data center costs about $80 billion. Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity, the total capital expenditure could reach around $8 trillion, which would require roughly $800 billion in profits just to cover interest. Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years, which further undermines long-term financial returns. He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence (AGI) with current technology is between zero and one percent, making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain. Still, Krishna acknowledged the potential of today’s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains. He cautioned that while infrastructure-heavy “AGI-race” spending may not pay off, more modest, business-focused AI deployments could still be worthwhile. [Link to article](",

      "selftext_processed": "Arvind Krishna CEO of IBM has argued that the recent surge in spending by Big Tech on AIdata centers is economically unrealistic . On the “ Decoder ” podcast he estimated that building and fully outfitting a onegigawatt AI data center costs about $ 80 billion . Given that industry announcements suggest firms are planning up to 100 gigawatts of compute capacity the total capital expenditure could reach around $ 8 trillion which would require roughly $ 800 billion in profits just to cover interest . Krishna also highlighted that AI hardware like GPUs depreciates quickly and often needs to be replaced roughly every five years which further undermines longterm financial returns . He said he believes the likelihood of achieving true artificial general intelligence AGI with current technology is between zero and one percent making the massive infrastructure bets more speculative than certain . Still Krishna acknowledged the potential of today ’ s AI tools to deliver significant enterprise productivity gains . He cautioned that while infrastructureheavy “ AGIrace ” spending may not_pay off more modest businessfocused AI deployments could still be worthwhile . Link to article"

I have a healthy amount of Alphabet stock in the portfolio, so wondering what the consensus is on the medium term. They seem more resilient from other AI stocks, given the breadth of their offerings and how they fared through 08 and COVID. But ads are also vulnerable to a downturn, so maybe they're hit regardless, or even worse, than someone like MSFT or AMZN? IDK, what's the consensus here? And not looking for a debate on whether or not we're in a bubble, save that for another post - let's just assume we are, what do you think GOOG's prospects would be?",

But ads are also vulnerable to a downturn so maybe theyre hit regardless or even worse than someone like MSFT or AMZN IDK whats the consensus here And not_looking for a debate on whether or not_were in a bubble save that for another post lets just assume we are what do you think GOOGs prospects would be"

      "selftext": "You don't need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musk's LIES. Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla. Let’s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed. Feel free to verify each statement yourself :) Long story short, Burry said has an history of going all-in in whatever sounds cool, rarely following up on promises and that competition wins. Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 2020/2021. He then moved to full-self driving as its \"main goal\", but Google’s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4. Tesla? 20 cars that still need supervision (level 2+) but hear me out, he's gonna DOUBLE it to 40 by late December. Ready for the misleading headlines \"Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network\" ??? So after failing with this, he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots. Last year he promised by the end of this year he'd produce 5000 robots. Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that’s just what he dies. He got his Trillion dollar package, he's good. In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality... so, as Burry said, the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elon's total addressable market. Now, I personally don't trust a management who doesn't offer reliable projections. When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls, their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up. Just take note, for each company, of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters, set it on your calendar to check back on it and you’ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don’t have time to listen/read all of the guidance, copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto :) ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious, never overpromises and often overdelivers. That's a company you can trust. That's a company who's CEO words are worth something while Elon's at this point is just toilet paper. Guy is not a genius, he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is. This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world. Then he takes all the credit, as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is. You don't need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud, you just need to actually listen what he says and how he's just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says. He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved, the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and ego-driven adventures against OpenAI, , and whomever proved to be better than him at executing. To be complete, here's the list of unmet promises: - $25000 family car: promised in 2006. January 2025 he confirmed production would start, later scrapped the plan in April 2025. - Cheaper models announced late 2024: delayed to prioritize Cybertruck (which was a complete failure) - Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production. Delayed every year since then, new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered. - New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production, Delayed every year since then. - Unsupervised full self driving in Austin: promised by June 2025, still not achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size. - Large-scale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles: bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far. - Self-delivering teslas: promised by 2019, never realized. IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER I'm not saying you should sell. Just stay informed, read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock. You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk, knowing there's a history of missing deadlines, promises and flip-flop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail. The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true, but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon. Ignore people with aggressive ideas, they are just desperate Read the comments, you’ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts.

      "selftext_processed": "You dont need Michael Burry to see through Elon Musks LIES . Today I see everyone reposting the news about Michael Burry and his statements about Tesla . Let ’ s use data and factual undeniable statements once again to educate the feed . Feel free to verify each statement yourself Long story short Burry said has an history of going allin in whatever sounds cool rarely following up on promises and that competition wins . Elon was all in on electric vehicles until other competitors started eating his lunch in 20202021 . He then moved to fullself driving as its main goal but Google ’ s Waymo came and demolished Tesla once again having 2500 FULLY AUTONOMOUS robotaxis across 10 US cities at SAE level 4 . Tesla 20 cars that still need supervision level 2 but hear me out hes gon na DOUBLE it to 40 by late December . Ready for the misleading headlines Tesla DOUBLES robotaxi network So after failing with this he moved to the Optimus humanoid robots . Last year he promised by the end of this year hed produce 5000 robots . Of course the promise was abandoned in October 2025 because… well that ’ s just what he dies . He got his Trillion dollar package hes good . In the meantime FigureAI and Chinese players are already displaying better models and higher levels of functionality ... so as Burry said the competition showed up and once again they will eat Elons total addressable market . Now I personally dont trust a management who doesnt offer reliable projections . When studying businesses I focus on what they said during earnings calls their promises and expectations and then see if the next quarters they followed up . Just take note for each company of the promises or guarantees the managers guided for the coming quarters set it on your calendar to check back on it and you ’ ll easily have a list of companies with managements you can trust If you don ’ t have time to listenread all of the guidance copy paste it into Google Gemini and ask for a list of items to check back onto ASML is an example of one such companies where the management is cautious never_overpromises and often overdelivers . Thats a company you can trust . Thats a company whos CEO words are worth something while Elons at this point is just toilet paper . Guy is not_a genius he just invested billions in his personal branding to make people think he is . This helped him attract talent and young engineers who wanted to actually change the world . Then he takes all the credit as you would expect from an egomaniac that is actually training his own AI to lick his boots and make him look better than he actually is . You dont need Michael Burry to tell you this guy is a fraud you just need to actually listen what he says and how hes just chasing sensationalism and news media titles parroting what he says . He just got his 1 Trillion dollar package approved the final stab to his shareholders while he uses the company to extract value to finance his political and egodriven adventures against OpenAI and whomever proved to be better than him at executing . To be complete heres the list of unmet promises $ 25000 family car promised in 2006 . January 2025 he confirmed production would start later scrapped the plan in April 2025 . Cheaper models announced late 2024 delayed to prioritize Cybertruck which was a complete failure Tesla Semi promised in 2017 for 2020 production . Delayed every year since then new promise is 2026 while competitors already delivered . New roadster announced 2017 for 2020 production Delayed every year since then . Unsupervised full self driving in Austin promised by June 2025 still not_achieved while Waymo started producing revenue and is increasing the fleet size . Largescale autonomy for MILLIONS of vehicles bro has only 20 SUPERVISED cars so far . Selfdelivering teslas promised by 2019 never_realized . IF YOU ARE A TESLA SHAREHOLDER Im not_saying you should sell . Just stay informed read about what the competition is doing and contrarian analysis about your stock . You might want to lower the exposure to the stock to a more manageable risk knowing theres a history of missing deadlines promises and flipflop to new ideas as soon as old ones fail . The current price assumes all those above promises will someday come true but this someday keeps being delayed while the price stays there due to the religious cult around Elon . Ignore people with aggressive ideas they are just desperate Read the comments you ’ ll see how aggressively people react when faced with facts . Stay safe stay invested Credits to Ettore Mihaili from Netherlands"

      "selftext": "Anthropic has tapped law firm Wilson Sonsini to begin work on one of the largest initial public offerings ever, which could come as soon as 2026, as the artificial intelligence start-up races OpenAI to the public market. The maker of the Claude chatbot, which is in talks for a private funding round that would value it at more than $300bn, chose the US west coast law firm in recent days, according to two people with knowledge of the decision. The start-up, led by chief executive Dario Amodei, had also discussed a potential IPO with big investment banks, according to multiple people with knowledge of those talks. The people characterised the discussions as preliminary and informal, suggesting that the company was not close to picking its IPO underwriters. Nonetheless, these moves represent a significant step up in Anthropic’s preparations for an IPO that would test the appetite of public markets to back the massive, lossmaking research labs at the heart of the AI boom. Wilson Sonsini has advised Anthropic since 2022, including on multibillion-dollar investments from Amazon, and has worked on high-profile tech IPOs such as Google, LinkedIn and Lyft. Its investors are enthusiastic about an IPO, arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first. Sources: FINANCIAL TIMES/ Reuter",

Its investors are enthusiastic about an IPO arguing that Anthropic can seize the initiative from its larger rival OpenAI by listing first . Sources FINANCIAL TIMES Reuter"

      "selftext": "While commercial property may go vacant somewhere, its rising in profit elseware. Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease. In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years. But unlike a shop in a mall, such as dillards or sears - simon is much less exposed than people think. The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use - the mall near me for example, houses a city police unit and a church. Im not looking at this from a consumer perspective - instead seeing it as an investment in best-in-class commercial real estate and adaptable management. The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary - as value was lost over speculative concern regarding e-commerce and terrifs. Which as seen in the earnings report, was almost a non factor. The stock fell due to irrelevant fud, and is due to make returns to its original trend line. 220-250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term, and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory, its already a proven success.. Cliff: SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no direct stake in the success of retail - its an asset management company, not a clothing store.",

Any clothing store with 10 years of tenure would be well aware of the rising costs to lease . In some spaces the rates doubled in the past 4 years . But unlike a shop in a mall such as dillards or sears simon is much less exposed than people think . The property and land retain a core value and are more often than not_in a high traffic area and converted to mixed use the mall near me for example houses a city police unit and a church . Im not_looking at this from a consumer perspective instead seeing it as an investment in bestinclass commercial real estate and adaptable management . The recent recovery can be seen as a reversal confirmation as the stock reclaims its highs from febuary as value was lost over speculative concern regarding ecommerce and terrifs . Which as seen in the earnings report was almost a non factor . The stock fell due to irrelevant fud and is due to make returns to its original trend line . 220250 are easily attainable for this over the longer term and mixed use isnt just some last resort theory its already a proven success .. Cliff SPG incorrectly coorelated with the everyday consumer despite having no_direct stake in the success of retail its an asset management company not_a clothing store ."

The entirety of the AI race is not dependent on Nvidia or AMDs ability to design the best AI chip. Its dependent on TSMCs ability to fabricate them. In this inflationary speculative environment AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom, are all given premium valuations with 40-120x pe and can still be considered fair value. TSMC is sitting at a \"healthy\" tech sector pe of anywhere around 28-30 day to day. They have a PEG of around 1, far better than AMD and is instep with NVIDA, and have operating margins on par with NVIDIA as well at 50%. Their revenues, margins, growth is exemplary and honestly criminally undervalued in such a inflationary AI environment. Are there any other reasons besides hostilities from China why TSMC hasnt gone side by side with Nvidia in growth? I'm No analyst and really am your every day idiot retail investor who absolutely fucking loves to by high sell low. But can anyone give me a clean argument as of why TSMC is more conservatively priced in comparison to all of the other AI stocks with insane valuations?",

      "selftext": "Hi all, I’ve been browsing several investment and homeowner subs and I’m still unsure what makes the most sense financially. From what I’ve read, the consensus seems to be that the decision basically depends on mortgage interest rate. Seems like ~6% is sort of the grey area. Ours is 5.75%. A little over a year ago, I got a much better job so my income level is relatively high but I’ve only recently been able to contribute meaningfully (pretty much at all) to retirement and savings. Right now, I’m maxing my Roth IRA, HSA, and 401(k). We also just bought a house with a 5.75% mortgage. From what I understand, investing in broad ETFs like VTI and VXUS would historically yield more than 5.75% in the long run (like ~8%?), so I could potentially grow my wealth faster by investing. I feel a bit behind in savings for my age (31) and could afford to put money in now to try to catch up. But, I keep going back to thinking we could be paying down our principal, especially at the beginning it would be more powerful than doing it later. I’m wondering if it’s really as simple as just comparing the mortgage rate to expected market returns, or if there are other factors I should consider. Maybe it is best to do some of both? Thank you!",

Hold to maturity: Income is state/local tax free. Sell the bond for a profit on the secondary market: Income is effectively a short term capital gain where both state/local and federal taxes apply. So in California where my state taxes are ~10%, I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10% lower than the secondary market price. Is my understanding correct here?",

Hold to maturity Income is statelocal tax free . Sell the bond for a profit on the secondary market Income is effectively a short term capital gain where both statelocal and federal taxes apply . So in California where my state taxes are 10 % I should only sell the bond if the face value of the bond is 10 % lower than the secondary market price . Is my understanding correct here"

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick, further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank. “We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year,” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting. Last week, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell, and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesday's cabinet meeting. “I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too,” Trump said. “I don't know who qualifies for the word ‘potential.’ I can tell you he's a respected individual. Thank you, Kevin.” Trump's remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement. Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold, who has overseen the selection process, previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas. The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik, he had considered about 10 candidates for the position, but now “we've narrowed it down to one person.” However, it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions, meaning the nomination cannot be considered final until formally announced. Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh, and BlackRock's Rick Riddell. For months, Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's term expires in May, and appointing his successor will be Trump's biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed. Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts, expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively. Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday, calling him a “stubborn guy who probably doesn't like your president.” Although Powell's term as chairman ends next year, he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years. In September, Trump explicitly named Hassett, Wash, and Waller as his top three candidates. Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary, but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer. The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank. However, Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters. Additionally, the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trump's attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook. Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation. If the nominee is an outsider, they are likely to receive a 14-year term as a Fed governor, beginning February 1.",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump said Tuesday he plans to announce his choice for Federal Reserve chair in early 2026 and hinted that National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett could be his pick further fueling speculation about the next leader of the U.S. central bank . “ We may announce the new chair of the Federal Reserve early next year ” Trump said during a White House cabinet meeting . Last week sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that Hassett was considered a potential successor to Powell and Trump also endorsed this position at another event shortly after Tuesdays cabinet meeting . “ I guess the potential candidate for Fed chair is here too ” Trump said . “ I dont know who qualifies for the word ‘ potential. ’ I can tell you hes a respected individual . Thank you Kevin. ” Trumps remarks provided a clearer timeline for an announcement . Treasury Secretary Scott Bechtold who has overseen the selection process previously indicated the candidate could be revealed around Christmas . The president said Tuesday that after consulting with Besent and Commerce Secretary Howard Luteinik he had considered about 10 candidates for the position but now “ weve narrowed it down to one person. ” However it is well known that Trump frequently makes unexpected personnel and policy decisions meaning the nomination can not be considered final until formally announced . Other candidates included Federal Reserve Board members Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman former Fed Board member Kevin Warsh and BlackRocks Rick Riddell . For months Trump has pressured the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates . Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powells term expires in May and appointing his successor will be Trumps biggest opportunity yet to reshape the Fed . Trump has criticized Powell for being too slow and cautious on rate cuts expressing hope that his replacement would push for reductions more aggressively . Trump again criticized Powell on Tuesday calling him a “ stubborn guy who probably doesnt like your president. ” Although Powells term as chairman ends next year he could remain on the board as a governor for two more years . In September Trump explicitly named Hassett Wash and Waller as his top three candidates . Trump has also repeatedly expressed his desire for Cent to serve as Treasury Secretary but the Treasury Secretary has repeatedly declined the offer . The selection of the Federal Reserve Chair and Board members typically represents the most direct avenue for the President to influence the central bank . However Trump has consistently criticized the Fed publicly for its sluggish response in lowering borrowing costs and for spending lavishly on renovating its headquarters . Additionally the White House has filed a lawsuit over Trumps attempt to dismiss Fed Governor Lisa Cook . Whoever Trump selects as Fed chair will require Senate confirmation . If the nominee is an outsider they are likely to receive a 14year term as a Fed governor beginning February 1 ."

      "selftext": "The Verge, Dec 2, 2025 Google’s own ‘code red’ response to ChatGPT has started paying off. The tides are turning in the AI race, and the pressure is getting to OpenAI. Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “code red” on Monday, urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT, an indicator that the startup’s once-unassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in. In the memo, reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information, Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads, shopping and health agents, and a personal assistant, Pulse, to focus on improving ChatGPT. This includes core features like greater speed and reliability, better personalization, and the ability to answer more questions, he said. There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot, the memo said, and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development. The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability. It is also something of a full-circle moment in the AI race. Google, which declared its own “code red” after the arrival of ChatGPT, is a particular concern. Google’s AI user base is growing - helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model - and its latest AI model, Gemini 3, blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics.

Chief executive Sam Altman reportedly declared a “ code red ” on Monday urging staff to improve its flagship product ChatGPT an indicator that the startup ’ s onceunassailable lead is eroding as competitors like Google and Anthropic close in . In the memo reported by the Wall Street Journal and The Information Altman said the company will be delaying initiatives like ads shopping and health agents and a personal assistant Pulse to focus on improving ChatGPT . This includes core features like greater speed and reliability better personalization and the ability to answer more questions he said . There will be a daily call for those tasked with improving the chatbot the memo said and Altman encouraged temporary team transfers to speed up development . The newfound urgency illustrates an inflection point for OpenAI as it spends hundreds of billions of dollars to fund growth and figures out a path to future profitability . It is also something of a fullcircle moment in the AI race . Google which declared its own “ code red ” after the arrival of ChatGPT is a particular concern . Google ’ s AI user base is growing helped by the success of popular tools like the Nano Banana image model and its latest AI model Gemini 3 blew past its competitors on many industry benchmarks and popular metrics .

Vultr (backed by AMD) is investing over $1 billion in Ohio to build a 50MW AI chip cluster that will use AMD's AI processors. While much smaller than Microsoft/Google/META clusters, what's interesting is: Their cloud service is priced at roughly half that of large cloud providers. This could be a real alternative for startups and small AI teams that can't afford NVIDIA's cloud platform. The facility is scheduled to be operational in Q1 2026. This seems to herald the arrival of cheaper, more distributed AI computing. What do you all think? Is this a significant shift, or just market noise?",

I am trying to cash it out in his name (he has medical problems, and still alive), and the bank said that it needs to be digitized; no problem. I got the forms to get it digitized from Computershare, however I still have questions. According to computershare I have to send it to them in the states (the actual certificate), and I think make an account for him-which I did (the people were not helpful at all). I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form: a letter of authorization to transfer security to non-register account. So my question is should I still send the certificate to computer share along with the the paperwork or should I just send the certificate to the bank he using now?",

I am trying to cash it out in his name he has medical problems and still alive and the bank said that it needs to be digitized no_problem . I got the forms to get it digitized from Computershare however I still have questions . According to computershare I have to send it to them in the states the actual certificate and I think make an account for himwhich I did the people were not_helpful at all . I told the bank I got the paperwork and now the bank is saying to use their form a letter of authorization to transfer security to nonregister account . So my question is should I still send the certificate to computer share along with the the paperwork or should I just send the certificate to the bank he using now"

      "selftext": "I've read the books about investments like \"The Simple Path to Wealth\" and it makes sense that companies come and go in and out of the index funds based on how their business is doing and trust of the people, performance, reputation, sales. Or rather *MADE* sense, back those days when not your every neighbor was an \"investor\" with a collection of stocks on their apps. And those investors really were analyzing and investing in things doing good and sold those doing not so well. Now coming to our days: people just invest monthly into MAG7/S&P500/etc doesn't matter are they doing good or bad(just look at Tesla with their fantasy valuation). Americans do their 401k, Europeans with their pension funds and brokers who encourage to put XXX every month into stocks. This is a huge and constant inflow of money. That is *NOT* based on any analysis, but simply because everyone and their dog are doing this, trying to escape inflation losses and get rich. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for Mag 7 is now about 31x. This is an enormous inflation. It's common to say crypto is based on trust and a ponzi. Now could you shed a light, how stock markets are different in a broad sense, if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier? **EDIT** Thanks to everyone for the answers, maybe I should've worded it clearer that my misconception/assumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index (like the S&P 500), they aren't looking at the individual stock's value. The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis, making it seem like a closed loop - a \"Ponzi scheme\" where the only buyers are the index funds themselves. u/[stuporman86]( and others brought great points here, that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here: \\- funds vs direct holdings: even though passive funds recently exceeded 50% of the money held in investment funds, funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment. The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings. This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching, selecting, and trading individual stocks and it' is crucial for setting prices based on value, not just automated buying. \\- economic studies suggest that a \"slim minority\" of informed, active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery",

Now could you shed a light how stock markets are different in a broad sense if people from all around the world simply put money there every month in a dream of getting richer thus inflating every stock and making richer those who entered earlier EDIT Thanks to everyone for the answers maybe I shouldve worded it clearer that my misconceptionassumption I was trying to present is that if everyone is just buying the index like the SP 500 they arent looking at the individual stocks value . The fear is that this passive buying could artificially inflate prices without any fundamental analysis making it seem like a closed loop a Ponzi scheme where the only buyers are the index funds themselves . ustuporman86 and others brought great points here that deny that and I wanted to summarize it here funds vs direct holdings even though passive funds recently exceeded 50 % of the money held in investment funds funds themselves represent a minority of total market investment . The largest pool of capital is still held in direct individual stock holdings . This large pool of direct holdings means a significant portion of investors are still actively researching selecting and trading individual stocks and it is crucial for setting prices based on value not_just automated buying . economic studies suggest that a slim minority of informed active traders is sufficient to ensure good price discovery"

      "title": "$SNAP will be a 2026 standout",
      "selftext": "Disclosure: long 250,000 shares at $7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike post-Q3 earnings, making about $200k. However, I now look at SNAP as more of a longer-term investment, and my thesis follows: Since inception, SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can’t make money, which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do. It faces the following issues: -Founders control the voting rights and haven’t been the best capital allocators. -Egregious stock-based comp has diluted shareholders. -Best features (like Stories) copied by META and monetized much better. -Ad stack worst-in-class. -Very high operating costs, mainly due to infrastructure. -Young users, hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power. -Growing fast mainly in low-income countries like Indian and Pakistan, yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe. SNAP, as Spiegel mentioned recently, is at a crossroads. It can die a slow, unprofitable death, or it can innovate and start to make money for once. It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now, and I will mention why below: -Started offering various subscriptions, including Snapchat+, Memories Storage, Lens+, and Platinum. Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $750 million / year for now and is growing double digits, which is unique among its peers. I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan, as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center, such as Icloud storage, Google, etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there. The download and import process isn’t that easy, and there will be friction. A certain number of users will say “screw it, I’ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it”. Meanwhile, the users that do not pay for it will be limited in storage, thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense. -Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement. After all, what use is having hordes of users if you cannot make money off of them? Sometimes, you indeed have to “fire” your customers. -They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature, as well as Sponsored Snaps, with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages. The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue. -They recently reorganized into small, nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy. The Snapchat+ success was created by a small team, for example, so they decided to scale this operationally company-wide. SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech, and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “thing”, I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology. They have the most used AR products in the world, and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year. Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves, which is also a positive as I don’t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account. Personally, I do not feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success, mainly because SNAP has no record of being successful in hardware. I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well. If they bomb, then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward, which would also be a positive. What investors need to think about is this: How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU? SNAP has that, yet only has a $13 billion market cap. Ideally, the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials. Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs, a better ads platform, and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically. However, I’m not playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares, and a takeover won’t happen unless they want it to happen. More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout. Regarding stock-based comp, dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped, and while it is still relatively high, management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked. They recently announced a $500 million buyback, and I think we will see more to come. As for the recent $400 million Perplexity deal, I see it as a one-off and don’t ascribe much value to it, for now, especially since Evan said they won’t sell advertising against the chatbot results. In conclusion, I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year. I don’t have a target price on the stock per se, but it could become a $100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclosure long 250000 shares at $ 7.89 I invested in SNAP earlier this year more as a trade and sold after the spike postQ3 earnings making about $ 200k . However I now look at SNAP as more of a longerterm investment and my thesis follows Since inception SNAP has been an awful investment mainly because they can ’ t make money which is somewhat important for a business to be able to do . It faces the following issues Founders control the voting rights and haven ’ t been the best capital allocators . Egregious stockbased comp has diluted shareholders . Best features like Stories copied by META and monetized much better . Ad stack worstinclass . Very high operating costs mainly due to infrastructure . Young users hard to monetize due to lack of purchasing power . Growing fast mainly in lowincome countries like Indian and Pakistan yet flat to slight decline in North America and Europe . SNAP as Spiegel mentioned recently is at a crossroads . It can die a slow unprofitable death or it can innovate and start to make money for once . It seems that the company actually gives a damn about monetization now and I will mention why below Started offering various subscriptions including Snapchat Memories Storage Lens and Platinum . Subscription revenue is currently annualized at $ 750 million year for now and is growing double digits which is unique among its peers . I particularly like the Memories Storage Plan as it takes a cost center and turns it into a profit center such as Icloud storage Google etc…Many users may now want to lose the invaluable pictures and videos they have stored there . The download and import process isn ’ t that easy and there will be friction . A certain number of users will say “ screw it I ’ ll just pay a couple bucks a month for it ” . Meanwhile the users that do not_pay for it will be limited in storage thus SNAP will limit their data storage expense . Spiegel recently mentioned that they would put profits slightly above user growth and engagement . After all what use is having hordes of users if you can not make money off of them Sometimes you indeed have to “ fire ” your customers . They have increased space for ad inventory recently with their Spotlight feature as well as Sponsored Snaps with the latter improving margins as well even though there was surely some resistance internally over sticking ads in the messages . The fact that Sponsored Snaps won out and was not_vetoed shows the seriousness of management in using all available levers to increase revenue . They recently reorganized into small nimble teams in order to innovate and ship faster and bypass bureaucracy . The Snapchat success was created by a small team for example so they decided to scale this operationally companywide . SNAP has invested billions in its AR tech and while the jury is out on whether AR will ever become a “ thing ” I think we can safely say that SNAP is at the forefront of the technology . They have the most used AR products in the world and they are marrying their software to hardware with the release of their Specs next year . Rumor is that they are looking for a partner as it will require a lot more capital to become a consumer product sitting on shelves which is also a positive as I don ’ t want them touching those billions sitting in their bank account . Personally I do not_feel that the AR glasses will be a commercial success mainly because SNAP has no_record of being successful in hardware . I look at the Specs as a free call option in case they actually end up doing well . If they bomb then perhaps SNAP will stop committing so much capital to them going forward which would also be a positive . What investors need to think about is this How difficult is it to create a product that has over 400 million DAU and almost 1 billion MAU SNAP has that yet only has a $ 13 billion market cap . Ideally the company would be absorbed by a larger player as an acquisition would be immediately accretive to their financials . Opex would plummet since a MS or META or GOOG would have much lower hosting costs a better ads platform and employee headcount would also shrink dramatically . However I ’ m not_playing this story that way since Evan and Bobby have supervoting shares and a takeover won ’ t happen unless they want it to happen . More likely would be if they teamed up with some GCC capital and did a management buyout . Regarding stockbased comp dilution as a percentage of revenue has dropped and while it is still relatively high management is very sensitive about it and I think it has peaked . They recently announced a $ 500 million buyback and I think we will see more to come . As for the recent $ 400 million Perplexity deal I see it as a oneoff and don ’ t ascribe much value to it for now especially since Evan said they won ’ t sell advertising against the chatbot results . In conclusion I think the monetization efforts are heating up and 2026 could be a real turnaround year . I don ’ t have a target price on the stock per se but it could become a $ 100 billion company if they can continue to boost margin and topline as they should ."

      "selftext": "Honestly I’ve been thinking about this way too much lately… sometimes the whole stock market feels like it only works because everyone keeps pretending it works. Like literally the whole thing runs on “confidence,” “sentiment,” “vibes,” whatever you wanna call it. Earnings matter yeah, interest rates matter yeah, but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it’s worth buying. People hold because they trust it’ll go back up. People panic because they think someone else is panicking. It’s like one giant circular trust fall. Everyone is basically agreeing not to look down. And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense? Like not a normal recession or correction, but a day where enough people say “nah I’m done trusting this casino.” Would everything just… unwind? Would indexes tank for years? Would governments step in and force something? Or does the system somehow survive because it’s too big to fail, like people will keep believing simply because they have no choice? Idk maybe I’m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is. Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating?",

Like literally the whole thing runs on “ confidence ” “ sentiment ” “ vibes ” whatever you wan na call it . Earnings matter yeah interest rates matter yeah but at the end of the day people buy because they believe it ’ s worth buying . People hold because they trust it ’ ll go back up . People panic because they think someone else is panicking . It ’ s like one giant circular trust fall . Everyone is basically agreeing not_to look down . And then I keep wondering… what if one day people just collectively stop believing the whole thing makes sense Like not_a normal recession or correction but a day where enough people say “ nah I ’ m done trusting this casino. ” Would everything just… unwind Would indexes tank for years Would governments step in and force something Or does the system somehow survive because it ’ s too big to fail like people will keep believing simply because they have no_choice Idk maybe I ’ m overthinking it but genuinely curious how fragile the system actually is . Is it all just confidence keeping the whole thing floating"

Earnings remain light, with Marvell, MongoDB, Vestis, and Credo drawing attention after their latest results. Meanwhile, tokenized markets continue to move at a very different speed. While traditional markets pause and wait for the Fed, Bitget Stock Futures just surpassed $10 billion in trading volume. Bitget and other plateforme are already running large-scale tokenized stock futures, while the Nasdaq is still waiting on SEC approval before it can offer its own tokenized stock offerings.

      "selftext": "In the face of cyclical patterns, everyone can only choose the optimal solution at hand and the approach that maximizes their own interests. Currently, the pricing and inventory models within the supply chain suppress prices, which best aligns with downstream interests. Therefore, they have no other choice but to follow this path. However, cyclical patterns will ultimately exert their influence. As one of the world's largest lithium chemical producers, ALB's standing in the lithium and new energy sectors is unquestionable. Compared to many new energy stocks driven by concept speculation, ALB possesses a more solid foundation: global footprint, diversified production capacity, core raw materials, and increased capital accumulation. ALB may experience short-term fluctuations due to market sentiment and lithium price volatility. But has its growth potential and room for expansion truly reached its limit? I believe not necessarily. Such fluctuations might present an opportunity for those who understand ALB to increase holdings or enter the market.Furthermore, for investors willing to tolerate some market volatility, is ALB also a solid choice?",

Currently the pricing and inventory models within the supply chain suppress prices which best aligns with downstream interests . Therefore they have no_other choice but to follow this path . However cyclical patterns will ultimately exert their influence . As one of the worlds largest lithium chemical producers ALBs standing in the lithium and new energy sectors is unquestionable . Compared to many new energy stocks driven by concept speculation ALB possesses a more solid foundation global footprint diversified production capacity core raw materials and increased capital accumulation . ALB may experience shortterm fluctuations due to market sentiment and lithium price volatility . But has its growth potential and room for expansion truly reached its limit I believe not_necessarily . Such fluctuations might present an opportunity for those who understand ALB to increase holdings or enter the market.Furthermore for investors willing to tolerate some market volatility is ALB also a solid choice"

Their cloud unit just launched **Trainium3**, a new processor designed to run heavy AI model training at a lower cost and higher efficiency than Nvidia’s GPUs at least according to Amazon. The pitch seems clear: companies want cheaper AI compute, and Nvidia’s pricing + demand backlog is still insane. If Amazon can offer decent performance for less, there’s definitely a market for it. But there’s a catch. Trainium3 doesn’t have anything close to Nvidia’s software ecosystem. CUDA and the entire Nvidia stack are still massive moats, and they’re the reason companies can deploy models quickly without rewriting everything. Amazon doesn’t have that luxury yet. Iis Nvidia’s dominance still unshakeable because of the ecosystem lock-in or you think Amazon actually becomes a real competitor in AI hardware",

I have a post-tax account and a pre-tax Traditional IRA. The post-tax account is mainly comprised of ETF's while the pre-tax IRA is mainly comprised of individual stocks. I want to move the money to something like FSKAX (Fidelity Total Market Index) with maybe a little bit of FSPSX (Fidelity International Index) for international exposure, and maybe just a touch of FTBFX (Fidelity Total Bond) for balancing purposes - although probably unnecessary right now. Set, forget, and make auto-contributions monthly. Never look at it. This is long term, I am very confident I won't need the money for 20+ years. 1. For the post-tax account, is the easiest (and/or only) way to do this to have my FA liquidate all current ETF's, withdraw the cash to my bank account, and then re-buy the Index Funds under my self-managed account? I recognize I would incur any Capital gains taxes due next tax season. 2. For the Traditional IRA I obviously cannot withdraw the cash, so how would this one work? Thanks.",

      "selftext": "\"NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share.\" --- The Synopsis Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software runs on Intel and AMD CPUs. This chess move by NVDA will shift the R&D hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs, thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA. The rest of the Mag7 (AMZN, AAPL, META, MSFT, GOOGL and TSLA) are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon (Trainium, M-series, MTIA, Maia, TPU and AI5/6). The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output, however there would be a design bias (via training data and hardware optimisation) that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs. This is a defensive play to prevent the rise of non-GPU disruptive custom silicon. Also, increases the NVDA CUDA moat. Exciting times ahead!",

The Synopsis Electronic Design Automation EDA software runs on Intel and AMD CPUs . This chess move by NVDA will shift the RD hardware standard from CPUs to GPUs thus creating a new secondary moat for NVDA . The rest of the Mag7 AMZN AAPL META MSFT GOOGL and TSLA are using Synopsis EDA software to design their custom silicon Trainium Mseries MTIA Maia TPU and AI56 . The NVDA AI GPUs will fast track the design output however there would be a design bias via training data and hardware optimisation that would result in the custom silicon chips being similar to NVDA GPUs .

In 2022 | got in a bad car accident and received a $27k settlement which funded my addiction for another 2 years. Kept on blowing up my account playing puts for 8 years straight. Even during Covid couldn't make any gains. Gave up for a year. I recently got promoted at work in October, so I decided to throw in $5k into a Webull account and now I'm here 2 months later.

      "selftext": "# Today, December 2nd, 2025 Hello again, it's the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the S&P500 is going to be positive for the year. I now have $18,421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $10,000 into it via the mega-backdoor method. I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $10,000 extra being converted in, but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback. Before the rebalance, accounting for the $10,000 coming in, my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions, which is basically no leverage. After rebalancing, my leverage sat near 2.2x. Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down. For this quarter I'm actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being. The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73% per Aswath Damodaran from NYU. Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below, it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below <4%. The authors did not explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4%, but it is pretty implied. How this impacts my performance in the long term is not known as this was not evaluated by the authors at the time of the book's publication. Unfortunately, this de-leverage change is occurring after a pullback, which can hurt my short-term performance, but in the long run it should all equal out (hopefully). Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information, not driven by fear or greed, suggests otherwise. Background * Currently 28 years old Reasons: 1. Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage. 2. The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0% invested into stocks by saying that in today's times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium (which I believe sits around 5% depending on which source you use) to determine whether to de-leverage. 1. In general, when the equity risk premium is <3% this indicates bonds may be a better investment, 4-6% suggests a 60/40 or a 70/30 stock to bond allocation, and >6% suggests potentially having a 100% stock portfolio. You will generally only see >6% during market downturns or recessions. 3. I am 28 years old. At this age per the book, I should still maintain my 2x leverage, however given the equity risk premium of <4%, I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being. Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy. Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise. That's all for this quarter, see you in March. \\--- Please see below for the current information regarding the trade. Which I will be updating every quarter (every 3 months). [ Performance: Initial investment (June 2025): $15,611.64 Current investment: $18,421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far: Processing $10,161 Below, I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement. **What Is Lifecycle Investing?** Lifecycle investing, by Ayres and Nalebuff, argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth (including future earnings) is much larger than their current savings. Since most young investors have little capital available for investment, but decades of future earnings, they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans. As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal, you should gradually reduce risk. How to do this: * First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share. * Use leverage through either margin, leveraged ETFs, or deep-in-the-money LEAPs * Reduce leverage over time, shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bonds/real estate and cash as retirement nears. * Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter. Essentially, you're looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x **My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation** 06/2025: With only $15,000 in my Roth IRA, I can’t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in > 2 years at the 300 strike price. So instead, I’ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150. VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase. Unfortunately VTI doesn’t offer options that expire >2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close. Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50% of the underlying cost roughly 50% of the ETF’s trading price, mirroring 2x leverage. Ideally, when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro E-mini futures then E-minis as from an cost standpoint, they actually cost the least as outlined in the book. Also, you get the additional benefit of them not expiring (at least in the same way options do). **Plan** * Quarterly Recalculation: * Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share. * Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s. 1. De-leverage Schedule: * Ages 27–30: Maintain 2x leverage. * Ages 30–40: Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase. * Ages 40-50: Transition to a 1x (unleveraged) total equity allocation. * Ages 50–59.5: Begin incorporating bonds/real estate and cash, shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches. **Risk Management and Contingencies** * Time decay: I’ll monitor the LEAP’s theta and, if roll-over costs or time decay become excessive, consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage. * Market extremes: ~~If the cyclically adjusted P/E (CAPE) ratio spikes above historical thresholds, I may temporarily deleverage to 1x-1.5x rather than fully exit equities. Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time. I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence.~~ * Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors. * Rebalancing frequency: I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal. **Summary** I’m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure, in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28-year-old. Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments. Over the next decade, I’ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears. Theoretically speaking, over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years. **Extensive Summary** I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free: [",

      "selftext_processed": "Today December 2nd 2025 Hello again its the fourth quarter of the year and it looks like the SP500 is going to be positive for the year . I now have $ 18421.29 in my Roth IRA but am in the process of converting about $ 10000 into it via the megabackdoor method . I ended up rebalancing prematurely to account for the $ 10000 extra being converted in but that may have been for the worse because I practically did this right before the market had a pullback . Before the rebalance accounting for the $ 10000 coming in my leverage was sitting around 1x with my VTI leap positions which is basically no_leverage . After rebalancing my leverage sat near 2.2x . Which sucked as I mentioned before because the market had a pullback and the downside with this strategy is that your leverage decreases as the market goes up but increases as the market goes down . For this quarter Im actually going to remove my leverage and buy and hold SPY for the time being . The reason being the equity risk premium for November is 3.73 % per Aswath Damodaran from NYU . Per the authors on a boglehead forum shown below it should be considered to reduce your stock exposure when the equity risk premium falls below 4 % . The authors did not_explicitly say to reduce your leverage or stock exposure when equity risk premium falls below 4 % but it is pretty implied . How this impacts my performance in the long term is not_known as this was not_evaluated by the authors at the time of the books publication . Unfortunately this deleverage change is occurring after a pullback which can hurt my shortterm performance but in the long run it should all equal out hopefully . Going to continue sticking to the plan unless new information not_driven by fear or greed suggests otherwise . Background Currently 28 years old Reasons 1 . Went down from 2x leverage to 1x leverage . 2 . The authors have commented on a question regarding the CAPE ratio being higher than historical average and their calculator recommending 0 % invested into stocks by saying that in todays times it would matter more to look at the equity risk premium which I believe sits around 5 % depending on which source you use to determine whether to deleverage . 1 . In general when the equity risk premium is 3 % this indicates bonds may be a better investment 46 % suggests a 6040 or a 7030 stock to bond allocation and 6 % suggests potentially having a 100 % stock portfolio . You will generally only see 6 % during market downturns or recessions . 3 . I am 28 years old . At this age per the book I should still maintain my 2x leverage however given the equity risk premium of 4 % I have decided to reduce my leverage for the time being . Buying and holding SPY is pretty easy . Just basically waiting for equity risk premiums to rise . Thats all for this quarter see you in March . Please see below for the current information regarding the trade . Which I will be updating every quarter every 3 months . Performance Initial investment June 2025 $ 15611.64 Current investment $ 18421.29 Additional Cash added to initial investment so far Processing $ 10161 Below I outline the framework of lifecycle investing and describe how I plan to maintain and adjust this strategy to retirement . What Is Lifecycle Investing Lifecycle investing by Ayres and Nalebuff argues that young investors underinvest in stocks because their total lifetime wealth including future earnings is much larger than their current savings . Since most young investors have little capital available for investment but decades of future earnings they should take on more equity risk early on through either leverage or loans . As you get older and approach your retirement age or if you get closer to your retirement goal you should gradually reduce risk . How to do this First estimate total lifetime wealth and calculate your Samuelson Share . Use leverage through either margin leveraged ETFs or deepinthemoney LEAPs Reduce leverage over time shifting to an unleveraged equity portfolio then add bondsreal estate and cash as retirement nears . Consider figuring out what price you need to restructure your portfolio after every restructure in case you need to do something before the end of the quarter . Essentially youre looking for the price targets where your leverage exceeds 2.5x or goes below 1.5x My Roth IRA and Leverage Implementation 062025 With only $ 15000 in my Roth IRA I can ’ t afford to buy a SPY LEAP that expires in 2 years at the 300 strike price . So instead I ’ ve bought one LEAP call option on VTI at a strike price of 150 . VTI was trading at 300 at the time of purchase . Unfortunately VTI doesn ’ t offer options that expire 2 years from now but 570 is somewhat close . Just for clarification buying a LEAP at 50 % of the underlying cost roughly 50 % of the ETF ’ s trading price mirroring 2x leverage . Ideally when I accumulate enough money I actually want to move to micro Emini futures then Eminis as from an cost standpoint they actually cost the least as outlined in the book . Also you get the additional benefit of them not_expiring at least in the same way options do . Plan Quarterly Recalculation Update my present value of future income and recalculate the Samuelson Share . Compare actual equity exposure to the target and roll or adjust LEAP positions to maintain roughly 2x leverage early in my 20s . 1 . Deleverage Schedule Ages 27–30 Maintain 2x leverage . Ages 30–40 Gradually reduce leverage to 1.5x as investments increase . Ages 4050 Transition to a 1x unleveraged total equity allocation . Ages 50–59.5 Begin incorporating bondsreal estate and cash shifting toward capital preservation as retirement approaches . Risk Management and Contingencies Time decay I ’ ll monitor the LEAP ’ s theta and if rollover costs or time decay become excessive consider swapping into fresh LEAPs or reducing leverage . Market extremes If the cyclically adjusted PE CAPE ratio spikes above historical thresholds I may temporarily deleverage to 1x1.5x rather than fully exit equities . Note I am still considering this since the CAPE ratio has technically been above historical thresholds for a long time . I might just reduce to 1.5x leverage max but my age and progress towards my retirement goal will take precedence . Switching to looking at Equity Risk Premium after seeing a discussion on bogleheads with the authors . Rebalancing frequency I plan to rebalance quarterly if my leverage deviates by more than 0.5x from its initial goal . Summary I ’ m leveraging my Roth IRA with deep in the money VTI LEAPs to emulate a 2x equity exposure in line with lifecycle investing principles for a 28yearold . Annual recalculations of total lifetime wealth and the Samuelson Share will guide my leverage adjustments . Over the next decade I ’ ll taper leverage and ultimately introduce bonds as retirement nears . Theoretically speaking over at least 30 years I should see higher expected returns relative to buying and holding SPY while systematically reducing my risk during the years close to retirement by shifting it onto my younger years . Extensive Summary I created a google doc for those who are interested to read my full summary on evaluating and implementing this strategy that I will share for free"

      "selftext": "Hi all, As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions. I currently make ~ 95k and live at home with parents, I don’t pay rent, but I do pay $1000/ month towards my car payment (took a loan from family, will be fully paid off in 8 months, after which I’ll have no “expenses” per se) Now regarding my investment journey, I’ll start of by saying all the research I’ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA, so I’ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO. I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago, contributing 10% with a 5% employer match. Now the above retirement savings which I won’t be able to touch until I’m older, but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well? Is that even possible without risk? I am willing to invest $1000 monthly, is it best to just invest all of it in ETF’s? Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF’s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I’m doing with my Roth IRA. I don’t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $800 towards an ETF and $200 towards company stocks be a smart move? Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account, my understanding is that the benefits of this are: no limit on how much you can invest yearly, and withdraw your contributions anytime tax /penalty free, is my understanding of this correct? Thank you for any answers and advice!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hi all As the title says I am 24 starting my journey in investing and have a few questions . I currently make 95k and live at home with parents I don ’ t pay rent but I do pay $ 1000 month towards my car payment took a loan from family will be fully paid off in 8 months after which I ’ ll have no_ “ expenses ” per se Now regarding my investment journey I ’ ll start of by saying all the research I ’ ve done points towards maxing out Roth IRA so I ’ ve set that up today and am planning to contribute monthly and invest all of it in VOO . I also have been contributing to my 401k since I started working about 1 and a half years ago contributing 10 % with a 5 % employer match . Now the above retirement savings which I won ’ t be able to touch until I ’ m older but what can I do with the rest of my money that can get me some short term returns as well Is that even possible without risk I am willing to invest $ 1000 monthly is it best to just invest all of it in ETF ’ s Is there a benefit in investing in different ETF ’ s or can I just put it all towards something like VOO like I ’ m doing with my Roth IRA . I don ’ t mind a bit of risk so would contributing maybe $ 800 towards an ETF and $ 200 towards company stocks be a smart move Since there is a capital gains tax for a regular brokerage account my understanding is that the benefits of this are no_limit on how much you can invest yearly and withdraw your contributions anytime tax penalty free is my understanding of this correct Thank you for any answers and advice"

      "selftext": "in my opinion, a low ROE does not mean a weak business and a high ROE does not always mean a strong one. For example Im taking UCL case (uCloudlink). Their ROE 8.7%, not really impressive but their fundamentals looks very interesting. Their EPS grew 85% over the past year, net income expanded 60% in five years and the stock up to almost 50% in 12 months. According to these numbers, I can see that their growth is outpacing than what their ROE reflects. Recently, their price drop a bit but when we looking into a long term and as Benjamin Graham said: \"In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine\". This shows that ROE didnt capture the full earnings of a stock.",

Their ROE 8.7 % not_really impressive but their fundamentals looks very interesting . Their EPS grew 85 % over the past year net income expanded 60 % in five years and the stock up to almost 50 % in 12 months . According to these numbers I can see that their growth is outpacing than what their ROE reflects . Recently their price drop a bit but when we looking into a long term and as Benjamin Graham said In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine . This shows that ROE didnt capture the full earnings of a stock ."

      "title": "SEZL DD pt.2: BNPL, the most misunderstood industry",
      "selftext": "[My original DD for SEZL is here]( Previous post if you haven't seen it yet \\^, little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL: **BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now. It's not nearly as irresponsible or \"set to blow up\" as the general sentiment makes it out to be.** 1. Standard loan tenor of Sezzle's BNPL average 40-50 days, with AOVs being $100-250. 2. BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx. 2% versus Credit Cards at 10%. People use Sezzle for groceries, gas, and other essentials/semi-essentials. Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs. 3. Sezzle does NOT make money off of defaulting consumers! The long-term value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time. They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition - again, short-term pain for long term customer filtering. 4. Limits and product usage can be changed instantly, versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice. Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time. 5. CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzle's target base is already low-mid income; consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance. **6. Management from Affirm, Klarna, Sezzle, Zip (BNPL providers) all noted no negative changes in repayment ability - Affirm CEO actually noted that govt. workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise.** 7. Points 1-6 point to the low-risk of these loans compared to CCs, Auto, Mortgages etc. due to the nature of their AOV + importance to the consumer. 8. The misconception that \"people will stop paying their BNPL loans first\". ZERO data to suggest this. Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario, along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs. People would much rather pay off the $100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever. 9. Sezzle offers optional credit-reporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour, along with their tier program. **What has overshadowed the share price as of late?** 1. Liquidity risk-off from high-beta stocks in recent weeks (late Oct-now) 2. Rising delinquency rates that were guided for, in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment & shaky macro news. Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2% to 3% in recent quarter, BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.5-2.75%, from original guide of 2.5-3%. 3. Compressed net margin from 28% Q2 to 23% Q3 - mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates, again, were guided for at start of the year. Should not be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product (subscriptions versus one-time use card). Expecting 25-27.5% stable net margin for 2026. There is SOME real concern here but not scary enough to lose conviction IMO. **Why I believe upside is 100% from here (6m+ hold)** 1. Re-shift to subscription mid Q3 netted +80,000 active subscribers. Assume minimum 120,000/Q add for the next 3-4 quarters: this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR, as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins. Their previous focus in Q1-3 was a lower margin, less sticky product which proved to not be as beneficial, hence the switch. Will be a $15M+ figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q1-2026. 1.5. Active consumers expected to grow @ 4-6% QoQ & payback period of 6-9 months on marketing spend (8M/quarter) will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters & beyond. 2. Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant \"fear\" classification. The fears are not completely unwarranted, but for the most part, blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space. This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour. 3. Continued penetration of consumer acquisition + general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users, and consequently revenue. 4. Trading at 14 NTM P/E growing at 60% YoY revenue & Net Income. History of earnings double beat. 5. Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged - management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentiment/repayment ability is low. Anticipating this to be closer to 4.5-5. 6. As bad as it may sound, their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials - cutting this service out of the user's life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it. End of the day, no different from a Credit Card. 7. Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners. *Conclusion: QE begins, market sentiment changes to \"BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears\", company performance will continue to deliver, and multiple expansion will persist to re-rate the company closer to 20-25x NTM P/E.* BASE case: assuming 20-25x NTM P/E: EPS 5.5 NTM @ May 2026: SP of $110-137.50. BULL case (short/gamma squeeze, unlikely, but happened May 2025): 35-40x NTM P/E, $200+ possible. UNLIKELY by EOY2026. **Positions have rotated into 800 shares. Options IV is way too high @ 90%.**",

      "selftext_processed": "My original DD for SEZL is here Previous post if you havent seen it yet little update on the BNPL space and DD for SEZL BNPL is the most misunderstood concept in the credit space right now . Its not_nearly as irresponsible or set to blow up as the general sentiment makes it out to be . 1 . Standard loan tenor of Sezzles BNPL average 4050 days with AOVs being $ 100250 . 2 . BNPL default rates have historically sat at approx . 2 % versus Credit Cards at 10 % . People use Sezzle for groceries gas and other essentialssemiessentials . Their card feature is sticky and the access to pay for essentials heavily discourages people from defaulting at these AOVs . 3 . Sezzle does NOT_make money off of defaulting consumers The longterm value lies in the consumer who is a repeat user and pays on time . They have kept their PLR steady and recently expanded underwriting to allow for more user acquisition again shortterm pain for long term customer filtering . 4 . Limits and product usage can be changed instantly versus a credit card limit change with 45 days notice . Ability to react defensively to negative loss trends in real time . 5 . CEO noted in recent interview that Sezzles target base is already lowmid income consequently the use and repayment of BNPL is more easily attainable and useful for this customer base than paying off a large revolving CC balance . 6 . Management from Affirm Klarna Sezzle Zip BNPL providers all noted no_negative changes in repayment ability Affirm CEO actually noted that govt . workers simply spent less using Affirm during time of shutdown versus repayment inability rise . 7 . Points 16 point to the lowrisk of these loans compared to CCs Auto Mortgages etc . due to the nature of their AOV importance to the consumer . 8 . The misconception that people will stop paying their BNPL loans first . ZERO data to suggest this . Paying back lower AOV items is a more realistic scenario along with the fact that BNPL platforms offer liquidity to these consumers in a way unmatched by CCs . People would much rather pay off the $ 100 loan and keep using Sezzle for their everyday spend than default and lose access forever . 9 . Sezzle offers optional creditreporting which builds credit score and encourages positive repayment behaviour along with their tier program . What has overshadowed the share price as of late 1 . Liquidity riskoff from highbeta stocks in recent weeks late Octnow 2 . Rising delinquency rates that were guided for in combination with a weakening consumer sentiment shaky macro news . Loss rates as of GMV trended from 2 % to 3 % in recent quarter BUT guidance was updated for full year loss rates down to 2.52.75 % from original guide of 2.53 % . 3 . Compressed net margin from 28 % Q2 to 23 % Q3 mostly attributed to increase in delinquency rates again were guided for at start of the year . Should not_be a permanent effect to margins as they refocus on higher LTV product subscriptions versus onetime use card . Expecting 2527.5 % stable net margin for 2026 . There is SOME real concern here but not_scary enough to lose conviction IMO . Why I believe upside is 100 % from here 6m hold 1 . Reshift to subscription mid Q3 netted 80000 active subscribers . Assume minimum 120000Q add for the next 34 quarters this shift will accelerate profitability and high margins despite increased PLR as subscriptions drive the most LTV and highest margins . Their previous focus in Q13 was a lower margin less sticky product which proved to not_be as beneficial hence the switch . Will be a $ 15M figure addition to their quarterly revenue by Q12026 . 1.5 . Active consumers expected to grow 46 % QoQ payback period of 69 months on marketing spend 8Mquarter will have compounding effects over the next 4 quarters beyond . 2 . Market conditions and macro sentiment for the sector is in a significant fear classification . The fears are not_completely unwarranted but for the most part blown out of proportion and misconstrued to the BNPL space . This is where stocks get beaten down based on rumour . 3 . Continued penetration of consumer acquisition general BNPL adoption is favourable for increasing active users and consequently revenue . 4 . Trading at 14 NTM PE growing at 60 % YoY revenue Net Income . History of earnings double beat . 5 . Prelim guidance of 4.38 EPS which was sandbagged management noted this number as guidance in a scenario where negative macro events occur and consumer sentimentrepayment ability is low . Anticipating this to be closer to 4.55 . 6 . As bad as it may sound their Anywhere subscription is heavily used for essentials cutting this service out of the users life would be far more detrimental than to pay it off and keep benefitting from it . End of the day no_different from a Credit Card . 7 . Continued adoption of BNPL by consumer and added merchant partners . Conclusion QE begins market sentiment changes to BNPL largely untouched by credit default fears company performance will continue to deliver and multiple expansion will persist to rerate the company closer to 2025x NTM PE . BASE case assuming 2025x NTM PE EPS 5.5 NTM May 2026 SP of $ 110137.50 . BULL case shortgamma squeeze unlikely but happened May 2025 3540x NTM PE $ 200 possible . UNLIKELY by EOY2026 . Positions have rotated into 800 shares . Options IV is way too high 90 % ."

Unless it's critical, I'll not say who I'm investing through just yet. One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they cannot change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago. I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments. If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases, I'm going to have a massive tax load. If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases, I may actually be showing a loss. This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest, like next year when I'll be retired and have no salary income to report for the year.",

Unless its critical Ill not_say who Im investing through just yet . One of the larger investment companies in the US is currently telling me that they can not change the cost basis for a bunch of sales I did a couple months ago . I sold about half of my total assets in a number of investments . If I have to use a cost basis that is based on the first half of the purchases Im going to have a massive tax load . If the IRS is told that the cost basis is based upon the latter half of the purchases I may actually be showing a loss . This becomes important because I want to pay the tax on the earliest purchases in a year when my tax load is the lowest like next year when Ill be retired and have no_salary income to report for the year ."

      "selftext": "Apple’s head of artificial intelligence, John Giannandrea, will step down from his position, the company announced on Monday. The move is the most visible shakeup in Apple’s artificial intelligence group since the company announced Apple Intelligence, its AI software suite, in 2024. Apple Intelligence, which was intended to put Apple alongside AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, has not been well-reviewed by users and critics. Earlier this year, one of its most critical aspects, a significantly improved Siri assistant, was delayed until 2026. Giannandrea will be replaced by Amar Subramanya, an AI researcher who most recently worked for Microsoft. Before that, he worked at Google’s DeepMind, according to his LinkedIn profile. Subramanya will be Apple’s vice president of AI, the company said, and will report to software chief Craig Federighi. Giannandrea was a senior vice president and reported to Apple CEO Tim Cook. Apple said Giannandrea would remain as an advisor until next spring. In a statement, Cook said that Federighi already played a key role in Apple’s AI efforts. Federighi is Apple’s top software executive. “In addition to growing his leadership team and AI responsibilities with Amar’s joining, Craig has been instrumental in driving our AI efforts, including overseeing our work to bring a more personalized Siri to users next year,” Cook said in a statement. Subramanya will lead teams at Apple working on the company’s foundation models, research, and AI safety, the company said. Source: [",

      "selftext": "[Last post]( I had a $2.1M account with $1M in gains. In 6 months, the account grew another **+$470K** so I'm at **+$1.5M** of total gains [since my first post 5 and a half years ago]( I did withdraw $250K to buy a new home, so the account sits at $2.3M. [Ending - Net Deposits = +$1.5M in gains]( That's a +27% compound return a year for nearly 6 years. I continue to crush regular, r/stock boomer index fund portfolios: [I \\(blue\\) am +263&#37; while stocks \\(green\\) are barely +100&#37; over that time period]( The account has $7.3M assets and $5M borrowed in options so that's **3.2x** leverage. I'm under-leveraged, I know. The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage. I haven't decided. Summary: \\- Borrow 2-4x the value of your account on margin. \\- Dump it all in a multi-asset, diversified portfolio. For the stock sleeve, I prefer smart-beta funds due to their higher expected returns. **The goal is maximum compound returns.** [Positions: Stocks, bonds, mutual funds and $5M borrowed in Box Spread Options]( Q&A 1) *When will you de-lever/pay-off the debt/liquidate?* \\- Never. This maximizes returns. Why do anything but this? 2) *What's it like for your account to grow +$1M per year?* \\- It's cool, you should try it. Save what you can, invest it like this and give it time. I started with just $20K in 2017. *3) Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere?* \\- I have every penny riding in here. Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27% per year so why do that?",

Ending Net Deposits $ 1.5M in gains Thats a 27 % compound return a year for nearly 6 years . I continue to crush regular rstock boomer index fund portfolios I blue am 26337 while stocks green are barely 10037 over that time period The account has $ 7.3M assets and $ 5M borrowed in options so thats 3.2x leverage . Im underleveraged I know . The prudent and correct thing is to borrow another $ 2M and get back to the optimal 4x leverage . I havent decided . Summary Borrow 24x the value of your account on margin . Dump it all in a multiasset diversified portfolio . For the stock sleeve I prefer smartbeta funds due to their higher expected returns . The goal is maximum compound returns . Positions Stocks bonds mutual funds and $ 5M borrowed in Box Spread Options QA 1 When will you deleverpayoff the debtliquidate Never_This maximizes returns . Why do anything but this 2 Whats it like for your account to grow $ 1M per year Its cool you should try it . Save what you can invest it like this and give it time . I started with just $ 20K in 2017 . 3 Are you a billionaire with a bunch of assets elsewhere I have every penny riding in here . Any other place it could be in will earn me less than 27 % per year so why do that"

      "title": "Michael Burry Calls Out Tesla Stating They Are \"Ridiculously Overvalued\"",
      "selftext": "“Big Short” investor Michael Burry criticized Tesla in his latest Substack newsletter, calling the electric-vehicle maker “ridiculously overvalued” and pointing to years of shareholder dilution as a central concern. Burry argued that Tesla’s valuation remains disconnected from its fundamentals and highlighted that the company continues to expand its share count with no buyback program in place to offset the effect on existing shareholders. Burry cited Tesla’s SEC filings showing that the company’s diluted share count has grown at an annual pace of roughly 3.5–3.7% over the past several years, driven primarily by stock-based compensation and past equity raises. Tesla’s outstanding shares have risen from approximately 1.0 billion in early 2020 to more than 3.4 billion today on a split-adjusted basis following the company’s 5-for-1 stock split in 2020 and 3-for-1 split in 2022, both of which increased the total number of shares available to the market. He noted that Tesla issued multiple major equity offerings during the 2020–2021 period, including two $5 billion at-the-market (ATM) raises in September and December 2020, followed by additional tranches in 2021 totaling roughly $12 billion in new equity issuance. These capital raises contributed significantly to the expansion of the company’s float and remain a key driver of long-term dilution. Burry also referenced Tesla’s most recent quarterly filings, which reported over $1.7 billion in stock-based compensation (SBC) expense year-to-date, resulting in a continual increase in the weighted-average share count used for earnings calculations. Tesla continues to rely heavily on SBC as part of its employee and executive compensation structure, including multi-year, performance-based awards. Tesla has no active share-buyback program, and CEO Elon Musk has previously stated that repurchases would only be considered once the company achieves more predictable and sustained free-cash-flow levels. Burry argued that the absence of buybacks means shareholders absorb the full impact of ongoing dilution, particularly as the company issues new shares to employees and through equity-linked programs.",

      "selftext": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again, and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about. The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not look isolated at all. A 1% to 1.8% decline might seem manageable, but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time, it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals. The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this. Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback, I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup. Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high. Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising. That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me. What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt. Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia’s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path. If that is true, how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia’s long term revenue structure? Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue? Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory. They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320. A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious. Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia’s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle. The insider activity adds another layer entirely. Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day, totaling 9924868, with an average value of about 661657 each. The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern. The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher. It does not necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions. She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not a withdrawal of confidence, but it is a moment that makes you look twice. Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys. Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem. It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype. So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another. A stock sliding with its sector. A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not explosive. Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets. Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that cannot just be ignored. And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing. The question I keep coming back to is simple. Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more. I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next.",

      "selftext_processed": "I have been looking at Nvidia again and again and the numbers have given me the feeling that they are sending mixed signals worth slowing down to think about . The stock has been slipping alongside the broader tech weakness and the movement does not_look isolated at all . A 1 % to 1.8 % decline might seem manageable but when the entire Nasdaq is softening at the same time it raises the question of whether Nvidia is being pulled by the market or weighed down by its own fundamentals . The part i was looking deep into was what happens in moments like this . Whenever a big name like NVDA starts showing a heavier pullback I notice how traders react during my panic research when my SL was hit on my bitget setup . Some look for ways to reduce friction on their exposure others go for onchain no_trading fee trades while others just sit down watching from afar especially when volatility is already high . Sentiment shifts toward anything that reduces cost or things that can bring more as extras when uncertainty is rising . That adjustment in behavior always fascinates me . What pulls my attention the most right now is the conversation around the 20 billion dollars tied to AI related debt . Analysts have been hinting that some companies depending on Nvidia ’ s ecosystem might be carrying debts without a clear profitability path . If that is true how much indirect risk does that place on Nvidia ’ s long term revenue structure Is the market quietly pricing in this possibility or is the recent pullback just a reflection of broader tech fatigue Then there is the analyst sentiment which feels almost contradictory . They acknowledge the rising competition and spending pressure yet price targets still sit between 220 and 320 . A spread that wide in a shaky environment always makes me curious . Are these targets an expression of long term faith in Nvidia ’ s dominance or are they simply held in place while everyone waits for the macro tone to settle . The insider activity adds another layer entirely . Fifteen stock sales by Colette Kress in a single day totaling 9924868 with an average value of about 661657 each . The one that stands out is the 3083511 sale which is far above her usual pattern . The share size is more than 3 times her typical range and the value is almost 4 times higher . It does not_necessarily reflect negative sentiment but timing always matters and unusual numbers naturally raise questions . She still holds well over 123000 shares so it is not_a withdrawal of confidence but it is a moment that makes you look twice . Despite all of this Nvidia is still making forward leaning moves like its continued involvement with Synopsys . Even when the market feels shaky they are still committing to the semiconductor and AI design ecosystem . It signals long term planning but also makes me wonder if the broader AI cycle is shifting into a phase where profitability will matter more than raw hype . So my perception right now is shaped by numbers that feel misaligned with one another . A stock sliding with its sector . A 20 billion dollar debt narrative that feels heavy but not_explosive . Analysts sounding cautious but keeping high targets . Insider sales that mostly follow historical patterns but include one outlier that can not just be ignored . And a company still planting seeds for the next wave of computing . The question I keep coming back to is simple . Are these mixed signals the natural noise of a crowded market cycle or are they early hints that Nvidia is entering a different phase where every percentage point and every balance sheet detail begins to matter more . I am watching closely to see which direction the story leans toward next ."

And while OpenAI needs you to sign up for ChatGPT Plus, Google can just push Gemini into every Android device, Gmail, Docs, all the apps billions of people already use without thinking about it. It’s kind of sneaky but genius. Plus they have YouTube, Maps, Search… the amount of data they can train on is ridiculous. It’s hard to compete with that.

      "selftext": "🚨🚨 BARRICK MINING (GOLD CHAD OF THE CENTURY) DD 🚨🚨 aka: Why $GOLD is about to melt faces harder than a 1999 dot-com chart but with ACTUAL PROFITS Listen up you smooth-brained degenerates who think “diversification” means buying calls AND puts on the same ticker. I bring you THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The One True DD. The post that will make your future grandchildren ask, “Grandpa, how did you become disgustingly wealthy?” And you’ll just whisper… “Barrick, my child.” ⸻ 💰 THE SETUP: BARRICK IS PRIMED TO GO GOD MODE Here’s what’s cooking hotter than Mali during the wet season: 1️⃣ S&P500 Inclusion → +$10 share price Index funds will have to buy this like a boomer panic-buying toilet paper in 2020. Guaranteed forced buying = tendies. 2️⃣ Analyst Price Targets Averaging $46 Wall Street FINALLY woke up from their coke-coma and realized Barrick isn’t some penny stock miner digging with spoons. 3️⃣ FOURMILE MINE = THE NEVADA GIGACHAD • Literally the #1 best mine discovery of our generation • Doesn’t require double fraction processing like the other peasant mines • Single fraction extraction = lower cost = higher profit = more stonk go up This thing prints gold like a stimmy printer in 2020. 4️⃣ Mali Resolution → +$10 share price No more geopolitical headache. Add another $10 because peace = profits. 5️⃣ Production Increasing 6% Every Year Imagine a miner that actually grows instead of declining like your OTM calls. Wild. ⸻ 🪙 THE GOLD MATH (YES, I DID MATH. YOU’RE WELCOME.) At different gold prices, Barrick is basically a cheat code: • $55 share price @ $3300 gold • $65 @ $3700 • Bank of America says $4000 gold by end of 2025 • $75 @ $4000 • $85 @ $4300 • $95 @ $4600 • $110 @ $5000 Gold going up? Barrick prints money. Gold going sideways? Barrick prints money. Gold going down? Barrick STILL prints money because Fourmile is basically a money-spitting dragon. ⸻ 📈 NOW THE JUICY PART Starting valuation: $55/share at $4000 gold Every +100 in gold price = +$3.5/share Current gold price in your note? $4200 gold. That means: • $55 base • +$10 from Mali • +$7 from the gold price difference 🔥 = $72/share conservative value right now 🔥 Market currently pricing Barrick like it’s a grandma with a metal detector, not a global gold emperor with the best mine in Nevada. ⸻ 🚀 TL;DR FOR THE ADHD AUTISTS • S&P inclusion = forced buying • Fourmile mine = god-tier print factory • Mali drama resolved • Analysts already behind the curve • Gold trending up • Barrick undervalued harder than Bitcoin at $200 Target: $72 short-term. $110+ if gold hits $5k. ⸻ 🦍💎 FINAL THOUGHTS 💎🦍 This isn’t a meme stock. This is the anti-meme stock. This is the boomer stock that secretly lifts like Ronnie Coleman. This is free money with a shovel. The WSB play isn’t to YOLO weeklies — it’s to buy, hold, and let the Fed keep debasing the dollar until Barrick becomes a religion. GOLD TO THE MOON. BARRICK TO VALHALLA. I am not a financial advisor. I am, however, extremely bullish and slightly intoxicated. Positions Below ya regards, screenshot for proof 35C january 2027 40C january 2027",

      "selftext": "# RGTI Insiders still selling Latest sells were on 21-Nov by CFO and CTO. CEO Subodh Kulkarni sold ALL of his shares at $12/share [openinsider]( And while the company is burning cash and losing revenue, what are insiders doing? Still selling. The CEO still holds zero shares in his own company. Zero. Some people defend this by saying he has stock options, but that is not the same as owning the stock. For a company this young and unproven, a leader should have skin in the game. The people running this company are cashing out, not buying in. The fundamentals are getting worse and the insiders are heading for the exits. # $1.9M Q3 Revenue but a $8.5 B valuation I still think shorting this stock back to the $12-$15 range is the right play, and the latest 10-Q report proves my point. I just read their quarterly report for the period ending September 2025, and the business is actually getting worse. Their revenue for the last nine months was only $5.2 million. That is a massive drop from the $8.5 million they made in the same period last year. A growth story company with shrinking revenue is a huge red flag. So how are they staying alive? By printing a ridiculous number of new shares. They burned through over $41 million in cash in just nine months. To cover that, they sold nearly $347 million worth of new stock in an ATM offering. They are diluting everyone who owns the stock just to pay their bills because the business itself cannot generate enough cash. This is not a sign of a healthy company; it is a sign of continuing desperation. # Overall it will take atleast 10 years to get a useable quantum computer Here's RGTI CEO Subodh Kulkarni saying 10 years in Apr 2025: [ ..and Mckinsey & Co.: position 250 RGTZ - (inverse w/ 2x leverage)",

      "selftext": "Everytime the yield curve inverts, we get a lot of youtube videos where they fear monger using this fact. When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens, that's when historically, recessions have happened. The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break, and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession. This time however, the yield curve has come out of inversion (barely) and will either go up, or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up (in which case they say that the recession is assured). Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85% I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat, maybe there won't be a recession. Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession. At this point in time, based on the data we have, what do you think is most likely to happen (regarding the rate cuts, unemployment numbers, and the likelihood of a recession)?",

When the yield curve comes out of inversion and steepens thats when historically recessions have happened . The common reason cited is that the fed lowers the rate because it sees that the economy is about to break and is followed by steepening of the unemployment numbers which eventually leads to recession . This time however the yield curve has come out of inversion barely and will either go up or it might fall back if for some reason inflation goes up in which case they say that the recession is assured . Chances of Fed cutting rates by 25 bps in Dec has a probability of 85 % I think but if the unemployment rate remains flat maybe there wont be a recession . Plus we have midterms next year so administration will do its best to prevent a recession . At this point in time based on the data we have what do you think is most likely to happen regarding the rate cuts unemployment numbers and the likelihood of a recession"

There’s always that one stock you sold way too early, right?

I swear I wasn’t even planning to sell it, I just got nervous one random day and clicked sell without thinking too much. Biggest unforced error ever. Still annoys me when I remember it. Not asking for advice or anything like that… I’m just curious which stock you guys let go too soon and still kinda regret whenever you see its chart pop up somewhere.",

I consider it the top community app currently. Moving averages are converging and poised for an upward breakout. Keep adding. 2) BE: A clean energy company. Third-quarter earnings were exceptionally strong, far exceeding expectations, and it secured major contracts with Oracle and Brookfield. I believe the key to AI's true takeoff lies in whether power supply can keep pace. Otherwise, no matter how many Nvidia chips are purchased or how many data centers are built, it won't matter. I consider BE a leader in this field. Continue 3) EOSE: Provides long-duration energy storage battery solutions. Q3 earnings were exceptionally strong, with a current order backlog valued at billions of dollars. It possesses superior growth potential compared to peers. Recommend continuing to add to positions. Additionally: CRCL and NVO are currently undervalued at their current prices and warrant investment. Their long-term recovery is merely a matter of time. The above conclusions stem from my trading strategy and models, primarily applied to short-term trading and options. My overall current yield stands at approximately 163%. However, regarding the aforementioned stock strategies, I firmly believe their trends “will not change easily.”",

I (28M) have been working a corporate job since graduating college (~$85k salary), but only really started getting into investing around 3 years ago. My current breakdown looks like this: HYSA: ~$20k saved ($2,650 average monthly cost, 6 month safety accrued) - Saving around $700 per month 401(k): ~$21k invested (investing 4.5% with 100% company match at 4.5%) - Aggressive portfolio type, large cap markets and some mid cap markets only ROTH: ~$17k invested (try to put $540 in monthly, split between 90% S&P, 10% international) Personal Investments: ~$4k invested (mostly S&P with a handful of other stocks) - Investments are sporadic, thinking of cutting half of my savings moving forward and investing (e.g. $350 into HYSA, $350 into personal investments) - Also thinking of taking any interest earned on my HYSA, and putting into personal investments Let me know if there’s anything more I can do! Living in a HCOL city makes things a bit trickier, but want to try to streamline my investment process as much as possible!",

      "selftext": "No paywall: [ NVIDIA and Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ: SNPS) today announced an expanded, strategic partnership to revolutionize design and engineering across industries. R&D teams, from the semiconductor industry to aerospace, automotive, industrial and beyond, face significant engineering challenges including increasing workflow complexity, escalating development costs and time-to-market pressure. This expanded partnership will integrate the strengths of NVIDIA’s AI and accelerated computing with Synopsys’ market-leading engineering solutions to deliver capabilities enabling R&D teams to design, simulate and verify intelligent products with greater precision, speed and at lower cost. In addition, NVIDIA invested $2 billion in Synopsys common stock at a purchase price of $414.79 per share. “CUDA GPU-accelerated computing is revolutionizing design — enabling simulation at unprecedented speed and scale, from atoms to transistors, from chips to complete systems, creating fully functional digital twins inside the computer,” said Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of NVIDIA. “Our partnership with Synopsys harnesses the power of NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI to reimagine engineering and design — empowering engineers to invent the extraordinary products that will shape our future.” “The complexity and cost of developing next-generation intelligent systems demands engineering solutions with a deeper integration of electronics and physics, accelerated by AI capabilities and compute. No two companies are better positioned to deliver AI-powered, holistic system design solutions than Synopsys and NVIDIA,” said Sassine Ghazi, president and CEO of Synopsys. “Together we will re-engineer engineering and empower innovators everywhere to more efficiently realize their innovations.” **Joint Development to Enable Future of Engineering on Accelerated Computing** The multiyear partnership builds on strong, existing technology collaborations between the companies and includes the following initiatives: * **Broadly accelerate Synopsys applications:** Using NVIDIA CUDA-X™ libraries and AI physics technologies, Synopsys will further accelerate and optimize its broad portfolio of compute-intensive applications spanning chip design, physical verification, molecular simulations, electromagnetic analysis, optical simulation and more. * ​**Advance agentic AI engineering:** Building on the existing AI collaboration to enable agentic AI workflows, the companies are integrating Synopsys AgentEngineer™ technology with the NVIDIA agentic AI technology stack — including NVIDIA NIM™ microservices, NVIDIA NeMo™ Agent Toolkit software and NVIDIA Nemotron™ models — to enable autonomous design capabilities for electronic design automation (EDA) and simulation and analysis workflows. * ​**Connect the physical and digital worlds through digital twins:** The companies will collaborate to enable the next generation of virtual design, testing and validation through the use of highly accurate and sophisticated digital twins for industries such as semiconductor, robotics, aerospace, automotive, energy, industrial, healthcare and beyond. These solutions will utilize NVIDIA Omniverse™, NVIDIA Cosmos™ and other technologies. * ​**Cloud-ready solutions:** Synopsys and NVIDIA plan to make the power of accelerated engineering solutions accessible to engineering teams of all sizes by enabling cloud access for GPU-accelerated engineering solutions. * ​**Develop joint go-to-market initiatives:** To drive market adoption, the companies also have agreed to develop joint go-to-market initiatives to broadly reach engineering teams across multiple industries with both on-premise and cloud-ready solutions. This go-to-market effort will utilize Synopsys’ global network of thousands of direct sellers and channel partners, building on Synopsys’ broad customer base and existing agreement to license, sell and support Omniverse technology embedded in Synopsys simulation solutions. This partnership is not exclusive. NVIDIA and Synopsys continue to partner with the broader semiconductor and electronic design automation (EDA) ecosystem to create shared growth opportunities for the future of engineering and design.",

      "title": "IOVA DD: Best in class Cancer Drug",
      "selftext": "I am writing this on my phone. So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes. What IOVA does? Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors. (Roughly over 90%, remaining 10% being Blood) Their product, Amtagvi (lifileucel), is a one-time TIL therapy (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Doctors take T cells from the tumor, Iovance expands them into billions, and those cells get infused back into the patient. Very intuitive, essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer. Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real, durable responses. This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers. Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works. I hold 30,000 shares. 2) Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths. You may have heard of CAR-T but that doesn’t work on them. They only work for blood cancer which is only 10% of TAM, rest being Soldin tumor cancer. Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment, and 2L severely lacking treatment. If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers, the market is massive. Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD. Add cervical, NSCLC, head and neck, ovarian: the upside gets wide quickly. In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications, with several already in late stage phase 3. The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat. And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area. With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment. NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space. No other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is. They have their own manufacturing facilities that’s worth 1 billion USD itself. 3) Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid-2024. Early numbers: • Q2: around $31M • Q3: around $62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter. 70+ treatment centers active or onboarding. Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250-300M range. And management has reiterated their range for EOY. For a ~$1B market cap company, that’s extremely low valuation. 3) Bear Case arguments that don’t hold water Execution: With IOVA bears and shorts never questioned the science but about the execution. I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible. However, they bought in a new CFO (Corleen Roche) in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40% in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption: This was another pain point, during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA. Since, it is a Novel treatment. Patient referrals by Doctors was slow, and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process. In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson (The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies). The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff. Q4 will be explosive. Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write: 1. Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast. If they keep beating, the market re-rates this quickly. Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target. Q4 will be huge for this stock 2. New indications Cervical cancer filing potential. NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval First-line melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3. 3. Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway. (UK is already approved but not announced) Canada already approved. 4. Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time = more patients = more revenue. 5. Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable, any major pharma would want this platform. 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy Long-Term Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors, this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers. The total addressable market becomes enormous. At least $30B and at current share prices that’s $75 per share. Even if you are super bear about this stock at $10 minimum is already better than its current price. Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock. First-in-class advantage, strong early sales, a huge melanoma market, and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers. If they execute, this isn’t a 5 percent upside story. It’s potentially several multiples. This is why I’m long 30K shares. Risks Not sugarcoated: • Manufacturing is complex. • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong. Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail. But highly unlikely given its recent data release. It’s incredible • Volatility is brutal. Shorts have been at this stock with about 35% shorted. However, about 80-90% is owned by Institutions. Big names like Blackrock, GS , etc.. • They’ve diluted before and might again if sales don’t scale fast enough. But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don’t buy this thinking it’s a safe biotech. You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks. And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy, real revenue, growing adoption, a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers, and a valuation priced like it’s dead. I’m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science, the market, and the timing actually line up. If they deliver on the next 12–24 months of catalysts, this has legitimate multi-bagger potential. Q4 will be turning point. Get in before the stock rips. It will create generational wealth. If you want an actual shot at a big biotech move that isn’t complete vapor, this is one of the few worth watching.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am writing this on my phone . So forgive me for any typos or formatting mistakes . What IOVA does Iovance Biotherapeutics is the first company to get an FDA approval for a cell therapy that works in solid tumors . Roughly over 90 % remaining 10 % being Blood Their product Amtagvi lifileucel is a onetime TIL therapy tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes . Doctors take T cells from the tumor Iovance expands them into billions and those cells get infused back into the patient . Very intuitive essentially using our own bodies cells to fight cancer . Melanoma patients who failed everything else can now get a therapy that produces real durable responses . This is the first real proof that cell therapy can work outside blood cancers . Recently 5 year real world data was released and it only strengthened its proof that the drug works . I hold 30000 shares . 2 Why This Is Actually Big Solid tumors are the majority of cancer deaths . You may have heard of CART but that doesn ’ t work on them . They only work for blood cancer which is only 10 % of TAM rest being Soldin tumor cancer . Chemo and immunotherapy are the current 1L treatment and 2L severely lacking treatment . If TIL therapy becomes a category across multiple cancers the market is massive . Melanoma alone is 1 billion USD . Add cervical NSCLC head and neck ovarian the upside gets wide quickly . In fact the pipeline already includes ongoing trials for all of the above indications with several already in late stage phase 3 . The biggest one being NSCLC which is notorious in the oncology space for being one of the hardest cancer to treat . And Amtagvi is kicking ass in this area . With the recent early results indicating that they are the best in class drug with over 2 times better efficacy across all metrics with current best in class treatment . NSCLC itself is at least 5 billion USD market IOVA has the head start in this space . No_other TIL player is even close to where IOVA is . They have their own manufacturing facilities that ’ s worth 1 billion USD itself . 3 Sales Are Actually Real Amtagvi launch started in mid2024 . Early numbers • Q2 around $ 31M • Q3 around $ 62M Over 100 patients treated in a single quarter . 70 treatment centers active or onboarding . Revenue guidance for 2025 is around the 250300M range . And management has reiterated their range for EOY . For a $ 1B market cap company that ’ s extremely low valuation . 3 Bear Case arguments that don ’ t hold water Execution With IOVA bears and shorts never_questioned the science but about the execution . I will admit that execution in Q1 has been terrible . However they bought in a new CFO Corleen Roche in Q3 and she had already improved margin by 40 % in Q3 alone along with several other improvements planned for Q4 Adoption This was another pain point during the early days and up until Q2 for IOVA . Since it is a Novel treatment . Patient referrals by Doctors was slow and they had to figure out the logistics part of the process . In Q3 IOVA has teamed up with McKesson The biggest healthcare distribution and services company in the world specializing in Novel therapies . The benefit from this partnership will be reflected in Q4 earnings and they continue to setup more ATCs and train up staff . Q4 will be explosive . Upcoming Catalysts These matter far more than the long essays analysts write 1 . Quarterly revenue beats Sales are ramping fast . If they keep beating the market rerates this quickly . Recently after Q3 earnings several analyst have rerated already to high target . Q4 will be huge for this stock 2 . New indications Cervical cancer filing potential . NSCLC Lung cancer data updates for FDA approval Firstline melanoma combo with Keytruda in Phase 3 . 3 . Global approvals EMA and UK reviews underway . UK is already approved but not_announced Canada already approved . 4 . Manufacturing improvements Shorter turnaround time more patients more revenue . 5 . Buyout potential If the tech proves generalizable any major pharma would want this platform . 2026 will establish IOVANCE as a platform for TIL therapy LongTerm Bull Case If TIL therapy works across multiple tumors this becomes the cell therapy platform for solid cancers . The total addressable market becomes enormous . At least $ 30B and at current share prices that ’ s $ 75 per share . Even if you are super bear about this stock at $ 10 minimum is already better than its current price . Q4 will be the breaking point for this stock . Firstinclass advantage strong early sales a huge melanoma market and a pipeline that expands into larger cancers . If they execute this isn ’ t a 5 percent upside story . It ’ s potentially several multiples . This is why I ’ m long 30K shares . Risks Not_sugarcoated • Manufacturing is complex . • Treatment is intensive for patients but they are already developing less intensive treatment without the need for Interlukin 2 • Reimbursement must stay strong . Currently have cash till 2027 H1 • Trials outside melanoma can fail . But highly unlikely given its recent data release . It ’ s incredible • Volatility is brutal . Shorts have been at this stock with about 35 % shorted . However about 8090 % is owned by Institutions . Big names like Blackrock GS etc .. • They ’ ve diluted before and might again if sales don ’ t scale fast enough . But this is expected and normal in Biotech You don ’ t buy this thinking it ’ s a safe biotech . You buy it because the upside outweighs the risks . And the upside heavily outweighs the risks Bottom Line IOVA has the first approved TIL therapy real revenue growing adoption a pipeline aiming at much bigger cancers and a valuation priced like it ’ s dead . I ’ m long 30K shares because this is one of the few biotechs where the science the market and the timing actually line up .

Some indie developers (we) have been affected by Applovin account suspensions in the last month. These are meddium-size accounts (far from large publishers but definitely not small accounts) which were created years ago and have proven record of not engage in malpractice, in good standing and keeping within ToS. Funds ranging from 7000$ to 10.000$ have been witheld from us without explanation or response to any contact attempts. The following is my post: [ Independent from that, what appears to be system wide payments delay (potentially future payment freezes) have also been reported this month. [ Some developers have reported considering legal action which would be added to the SEC ( and State AG ( investigations already in progress due to its data practices and ad quality. Generally developers prefer not to speak out about these bans but, even if not publicly spoken, it is a widespread opinion in the mobile dev community that Applovin engages in all kinds of \"shady\" practices. Reason we keep working with them is they are close to a monopolistic position (alongise Google AdMob) with their platform, high eCPM and and market share. **Disclaimer: I have no capacity whatsover to do stock analisys or valuations and this kind of news might not be relevant to investors in this subreddit, I apologize to mods in advance if that's the case.**",

      "selftext_processed": "I wanted to share some things going on in Applovin from a personal experience as a mobile developer with 10 years experience in the market that investors here might find relevant . Some indie developers we have been affected by Applovin account suspensions in the last month . These are meddiumsize accounts far from large publishers but definitely not_small accounts which were created years ago and have proven record of not_engage in malpractice in good standing and keeping within ToS . Funds ranging from 7000 $ to 10.000 $ have been witheld from us without explanation or response to any contact attempts . The following is my post Independent from that what appears to be system wide payments delay potentially future payment freezes have also been reported this month . Some developers have reported considering legal action which would be added to the SEC and State AG investigations already in progress due to its data practices and ad quality . Generally developers prefer not_to speak out about these bans but even if not_publicly spoken it is a widespread opinion in the mobile dev community that Applovin engages in all kinds of shady practices . Reason we keep working with them is they are close to a monopolistic position alongise Google AdMob with their platform high eCPM and and market share . Disclaimer I have no_capacity whatsover to do stock analisys or valuations and this kind of news might not_be relevant to investors in this subreddit I apologize to mods in advance if thats the case ."

      "selftext": "Over the past year I’ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercial-stage biotech companies. Unlike most sectors, which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue, early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter. This creates situations where companies with FDA approval, real product sales, and multi-year cash runways still get priced as if nothing meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two. One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer’s drug called Zunveyl into long-term care earlier this year. They reported a little over $2.6 million in product revenue last quarter, and early adoption from facilities has been steady, but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering, solid QoQ growth. It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech, where the shift from a “pipeline story” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quarter-to-quarter noise. In most other industries, companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter, so I’m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech. Is this caution justified, or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase? [](",

      "selftext_processed": "Over the past year I ’ ve noticed something unusual with a subset of small commercialstage biotech companies . Unlike most sectors which generally trade on 12 to 24 month forward revenue early commercial biotechs often get valued almost entirely on their most recent quarter . This creates situations where companies with FDA approval real product sales and multiyear cash runways still get priced as if nothing_meaningful is expected to change in the next year or two . One example I came across was a company that launched a symptomatic Alzheimer ’ s drug called Zunveyl into longterm care earlier this year . They reported a little over $ 2.6 million in product revenue last quarter and early adoption from facilities has been steady but the valuation still appears anchored to trailing numbers rather than the trajectory implied by improving payer access and repeat ordering solid QoQ growth . It made me wonder whether this is a broader structural pattern in early commercial biotech where the shift from a “ pipeline story ” to real revenue causes the market to fixate on quartertoquarter noise . In most other industries companies tend to trade on future revenue rather than the most recent quarter so I ’ m curious why this disconnect seems so common in biotech . Is this caution justified or is it an inefficiency in how the market prices companies in the early commercialization phase"

I'm not like an investor, I don't look for things to invest in. I just try to build things. And then there happens to be stock of the company that I built. But I don't think about, “Should I invest in this company?” I don't have a portfolio or anything,” he said. However, on the broader industry, he bet on artificial intelligence and robotics, and particularly singled out Google and Nvidia. “AI and robotics are gonna be very important. Google is gonna be pretty valuable in the future, they've laid the groundwork for an immense amount of value creation from an AI standpoint. (And) Nvidia is obvious at this point,” he said. Why these sectors? Elon Musk believes that companies involved in AI, robotics, and maybe space flight are “overwhelmingly all the value”, adding, “Just the output of goods and services from AI and robotics is so high that it will dwarf everything else” Article: You can find the video on YouTube but I can’t post the link here because of this subreddits rules apparently. 1:26:04 is when Musk talks about Nvidia and Google.",

      "selftext": "Hey Everyone, I am rebuilding my investment portfolio after taking a big hit during the 2021-2022 crash(almost lost 200k). Back then I was very new to the stocks and not enough knowledge, was listening way too much to WSB I guess. I have had financials difficulties and had to file a consumer proposal. Lost mu business and house that I could not close in 2023. So last few years have been really tough, now I have restarted a new business and everything seems to be going okay so far. My business is doing okay at the moment, and I can comfortably invest around $10K per month. I’ve set up recurring weekly buys in Wealthsimple (since that’s my main platform). I’m mostly focusing on Canadian-listed ETFs to avoid the forex fees that come with buying/selling U.S. ETFs. Here is the list of my current holdings: |Category|Holdings Included|Current Value|2× Value (After +100%)|% of Portfolio| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |🇨🇦 **Canadian Equity**|XIC (TFSA + Non-Reg)|$6,717.35|**$13,434.70**|**18.5 %**| |🇺🇸 **U.S. Equity**|VFV + TSLA + SOFI|$10,314.18|**$20,628.36**|**28.3 %**| |🌍 **International Equity**|XEF|$8,257.78|**$16,515.56**|**22.6 %**| |🌐 **Global / Mixed Equity**|VEQT|$7,543.03|**$15,086.06**|**20.7 %**| |₿ **Crypto Assets**|BTC + ETH + SOL|$2,146.80|**$4,293.60**|**5.9 %**| |💵 **Total Portfolio Value**||**$36,980**|**≈ $73,960 CAD**|**100 %**| I do weekly auto buys: \\- VFV (S&P 500 exposure) \\- VEQT (Golbal equity) \\- XIC (Canadian market) \\- XEF (Global market) \\- A few individual positions : NVDA, TSLA, SOFI \\- Crypto: BTC, ETH, SOL, XRP (Small portion) Total: about $3,400/week (\\~$14K/month) split between TFSA, non-registered, and crypto. I would like advice on: \\- Am I diversifying correctly, are there better options? \\- Is my allocation too equity-heavy? \\- Any suggestions on dividend stocks? \\- Should I do one or two ETFs only instead of these many? I am just rebuilding my life and want to be careful, while making a good amount of investment towards our family's future. I don't want to do real-estate at all, not in next few years at least. Just want to start investing as much I can. Any advice/critisim is welcomes. Please give your thought. Thank you!",

Back then I was very new to the stocks and not_enough knowledge was listening way too much to WSB I guess . I have had financials difficulties and had to file a consumer proposal . Lost mu business and house that I could not_close in 2023 . So last few years have been really tough now I have restarted a new business and everything seems to be going okay so far . My business is doing okay at the moment and I can comfortably invest around $ 10K per month . I ’ ve set up recurring weekly buys in Wealthsimple since that ’ s my main platform .

      "selftext": "Hey everyone! So I, 20M, invest 2,500 dollars a month. I do an on/off split where one month I do the full 2,500 into my stocks/ETfs, and the next month I’ll do 2,100 into stocks/ETFs, but 400 into crypto (only BTC and ETH, 200 dollars each) As we’ve seen crypto has been falling a lot lately (BTC is well below 90k at the moment) and it leads me questioning, should I even be investing the 400 every other month into crypto that I usually do? Or just put my money straight into my stocks/ETS, and don’t do crypto? I mainly see crypto as a gamble. Not as an investment, I just jumped on the crypto train because of all the hype, I’m not really sure what my money is even going into. Any, and all advice is welcome! I plan to be in the market for a very very long time. Thank you for taking time to read this and reply :)",

      "selftext": "Some of the best ideas I've gotten to invest in stocks over the last 20 years have come from the pages of Barron's Magazine, so I'm going to start trying to summarize some of the stock picks made by Barron's in the current week's magazine. Barron's is released on Fridays after the market closes, so Monday is the first day to trade on their picks, and historically a Barron's recommendation can have a market moving effect because their influence on Wall Street is so strong. But do your own research and due diligence. From the December 1 Magazine: RBLX. Barron's thinks Roblox can move up 50% over the next 12 months, given its growing influence among children and young gamers, its low cost tools for designing new games and viral method of distribution. Article quotes an analyst who calls Roblox the Youtube of the online gaming industry. Stock is 30% off its highs given concerns about safety and content moderation regulation, but for the adventurous investor this might present a buying opportunity. D. Dominion Energy has been on the rise YTD but is only reaching a stock price that it reached back in 2023. Dominion has a reasonable P/E of 17 and a dividend yield of 4.3%. The catalyst: D is favorably resolving a regulatory issue over a big wind project under development which has depressed its stock price for 2 years. It is now is poised to benefit from the rise in data center energy needs that other electric utility stocks already have. SHOP. A Barron's article about AI enabling the retail industry, Barron's highlights Shopify as one of the early winners. Shopify's most recent earnings report showed early signs that AI is helping SHOP help their customer's online operation to increase revenues. GOOGL. Google was a big pick by Barron's six months ago to \"play catch-up\" with the rest of the MAG7 stocks as it was by far the most undervalued. Barron's call was very timely and lucrative, and two items in this week's Barron's reiterate the recommendation, one highlighting the break-out of Google Gemini 3 as the leading AI LLM, and the second article citing the emergence of Google's TPU chips as a competitive threat to Nvidia GPUs as evidenced by Meta's rumored deal to use Google Cloud and TPUs to power its AI.",

      "selftext_processed": "Some of the best ideas Ive gotten to invest in stocks over the last 20 years have come from the pages of Barrons Magazine so Im going to start trying to summarize some of the stock picks made by Barrons in the current weeks magazine . Barrons is released on Fridays after the market closes so Monday is the first day to trade on their picks and historically a Barrons recommendation can have a market moving effect because their influence on Wall Street is so strong . But do your own research and due diligence . From the December 1 Magazine RBLX . Barrons thinks Roblox can move up 50 % over the next 12 months given its growing influence among children and young gamers its low cost tools for designing new games and viral method of distribution . Article quotes an analyst who calls Roblox the Youtube of the online gaming industry . Stock is 30 % off its highs given concerns about safety and content moderation regulation but for the adventurous investor this might present a buying opportunity . D. Dominion Energy has been on the rise YTD but is only reaching a stock price that it reached back in 2023 . Dominion has a reasonable PE of 17 and a dividend yield of 4.3 % . The catalyst D is favorably resolving a regulatory issue over a big wind project under development which has depressed its stock price for 2 years . It is now is poised to benefit from the rise in data center energy needs that other electric utility stocks already have . SHOP . A Barrons article about AI enabling the retail industry Barrons highlights Shopify as one of the early winners . Shopifys most recent earnings report showed early signs that AI is helping SHOP help their customers online operation to increase revenues . GOOGL . Google was a big pick by Barrons six months ago to play catchup with the rest of the MAG7 stocks as it was by far the most undervalued . Barrons call was very timely and lucrative and two items in this weeks Barrons reiterate the recommendation one highlighting the breakout of Google Gemini 3 as the leading AI LLM and the second article citing the emergence of Googles TPU chips as a competitive threat to Nvidia GPUs as evidenced by Metas rumored deal to use Google Cloud and TPUs to power its AI ."

      "selftext": "I have spent past couple years researching what causes new investors and traders to consistently lose money… patterns that are rarely discussed in traditional finance books. While writing a book on the subject, I noticed some surprising trends. Three common traps every trader falls into: 1. Chasing hype: buying stock because “it feels right” or everyone is talking about it. 2. Ignoring red flags: small warnings signs in chart or social sentiment are overlooked. 3. Emotional overthinking: overconfidence or fear can destroy even well researched trades. I’m genuinely curious, which of these trap have you fallen for or seen friends/family fall for? Have you ever read a finance book that actually warned you about these mistakes or do most books just gloss over emotional side of trading?",

Yet, Schwab margin account, after selling securities, cash is not settled to withdraw, yet you can invest with that cash. It seems I can use that to trade same day unlimited without triggering margin as long as you trade with that money. Is it right? Or will it trigger the SEC violation? Some said margin accounts can back you up so as long as I trade with that cash before it is actually settled, you can trade unlimited without triggering margin interest. Of course, I have more than minimum assets for day trading.",

Yet Schwab margin account after selling securities cash is not_settled to withdraw yet you can invest with that cash . It seems I can use that to trade same day unlimited without triggering margin as long as you trade with that money . Is it right Or will it trigger the SEC violation Some said margin accounts can back you up so as long as I trade with that cash before it is actually settled you can trade unlimited without triggering margin interest . Of course I have more than minimum assets for day trading ."

If you DCA to an ETF over many years but then decide that you need to withdraw a large amount for an unexpected purchase, will it tax at the income rate (because of recent transactions) or capital gains because it's been over an extended period?

      "selftext": "So Trump randomly talking about shutting down airspace around Venezuela got me thinking about what actually happens to the markets if the US really goes after them again. I’m not making predictions or anything, just trying to understand the market side of it. Venezuela doesn’t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil, so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys. Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit, so if Trump goes full “we’re doing something big” again, that probably means oil jumps, energy stocks breathe for a bit, and airlines get punched in the face like usual. I’m wondering more about the broader market though. If it’s just a one-off strike, markets probably dip early then go back to normal (like they always do). But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess, then I can see VIX spiking, EM getting slapped, gold doing its “I’m useful again” thing, and everyone pretending they predicted it. Trump also flip-flops so much that it’s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves, but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn’t just fade in a day? Not looking for political takes, just the market angle.",

      "selftext_processed": "So Trump randomly talking about shutting down airspace around Venezuela got me thinking about what actually happens to the markets if the US really goes after them again . I ’ m not_making predictions or anything just trying to understand the market side of it . Venezuela doesn ’ t export like it used to but they still sit on a massive amount of oil so even a hint of military escalation usually freaks out the oil futures guys . Would be weird because the US only recently relaxed sanctions a bit so if Trump goes full “ we ’ re doing something big ” again that probably means oil jumps energy stocks breathe for a bit and airlines get punched in the face like usual . I ’ m wondering more about the broader market though . If it ’ s just a oneoff strike markets probably dip early then go back to normal like they always do . But if it drags out or turns into some long political mess then I can see VIX spiking EM getting slapped gold doing its “ I ’ m useful again ” thing and everyone pretending they predicted it . Trump also flipflops so much that it ’ s hard to take any of this seriously until something actually moves but still… how are people thinking about the actual market reaction if this doesn ’ t just fade in a day Not_looking for political takes just the market angle ."

      "selftext": "Note: \"Weak consumer spending\" refers to store expectations before the season started. Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No paywall: [ >Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season. Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza. >As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up, the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year, with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade. >Challenger, Gray & Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012. >The National Retail Federation, a trade group, also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season, plans to bring on extra staff could be at “the lowest level in more than 15 years.” Retailers were expected to bring on 265,000 to 365,000 seasonal workers, compared to 442,000 in 2024. >Interest in seasonal work, though, remains plenty high — up 27% at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board, according to Cory Stahle, a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab. >Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7% from a year ago, and still below pre-pandemic levels. (Indeed’s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall, such as in accounting and ski resorts, rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail, Stahle said.) >“I think it’s very telling that we’re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago,” Stahle said. “There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall.” >Retail especially has “just really pulled back,” he said. >The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119,000 positions that month, though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts. The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare, food services and drinking places, and social assistance, and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior. >Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans. Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year. >A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach, saying, “For the past few years, we’ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates. It’s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive.” >Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year, some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a K-shaped economy. A recent survey of 1,048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America’s Future found that 68% of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year, while 59% anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year. Just 5% of respondents were actively hiring or expanding, while 16% were scaling back, the survey found. >Read more: What is a 'K-shaped economy,' and what's causing the divide? >The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending. >Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring. >“Employers aren’t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through, or to the degree in which people are going to spend, and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing,” Stahle said.",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Weak consumer spending refers to store expectations before the season started . Consumer spending ended up being high which is why Black Friday set a new record No_paywall Plenty of Americans are expected to pour into stores and fill online carts this holiday shopping season . Fewer may be able to pick up seasonal work to support that bonanza . As layoff announcements make waves and the unemployment rate creeps up the usual holiday hiring spree appears muted this year with data from multiple sources suggesting that hiring plans may be at their lowest levels in over a decade . Challenger Gray Christmas said in its most recent labor report that seasonal hiring plans through October were at their lowest since the global outplacement firm began tracking them in 2012 . The National Retail Federation a trade group also said in a press call earlier this month that while strong consumer spending was expected to persist through the holiday season plans to bring on extra staff could be at “ the lowest level in more than 15 years. ” Retailers were expected to bring on 265000 to 365000 seasonal workers compared to 442000 in 2024 . Interest in seasonal work though remains plenty high — up 27 % at the end of September compared to a year earlier — as Americans struggle to find employment across the board according to Cory Stahle a senior economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab . Job seekers are competing for listings that are up just 2.7 % from a year ago and still below prepandemic levels . Indeed ’ s hiring data tracks seasonal positions overall such as in accounting and ski resorts rather than restricting seasonal hires strictly to retail Stahle said . “ I think it ’ s very telling that we ’ re still well below where we were in those seasonal jobs a couple of years ago ” Stahle said . “ There are clearly just a lot fewer opportunities overall. ” Retail especially has “ just really pulled back ” he said . The most recent federal jobs data from September showed that the economy unexpectedly added 119000 positions that month though that was before big companies like Amazon announced major cuts . The gains were concentrated in sectors like healthcare food services and drinking places and social assistance and the retail sector was roughly flat compared to a month prior . Yahoo Finance reached out to multiple big retailers about their hiring plans . Target has been quiet about exactly how many extra seasonal workers it intends to bring on this year . A spokesperson for Walmart said in a statement that the company would be taking its usual approach saying “ For the past few years we ’ ve taken the extra hours available during the holidays and made them available to our current associates . It ’ s worked very well for us and the feedback from customers and associates has been overwhelmingly positive. ” Though holiday spending is expected to hold steady this year some retailers have undoubtedly struggled as consumers hunt for deals in a Kshaped economy . A recent survey of 1048 small businesses conducted by the coalition group Small Business for America ’ s Future found that 68 % of owners reported their customers had less to spend this year while 59 % anticipated worse holiday sales compared to last year . Just 5 % of respondents were actively hiring or expanding while 16 % were scaling back the survey found . Read more What is a Kshaped economy and whats causing the divide The majority expected tariffs to have a negative impact on holiday spending . Stahle said all that uncertainty is translating to muted seasonal hiring . “ Employers aren ’ t quite sure as to the way that tariffs are ultimately going to come through or to the degree in which people are going to spend and so I think some of it is also just the broader uncertainty that companies are seeing ” Stahle said ."

      "selftext": "Technically the definition of volatility is the amount of movement either up or down, meaning a true volatility index would drop if the underlying bucket moves less than X up or down, and rises if the bucket moves more than X. We have VIX, but this seems to be considered a fear index, moving inversely with the market. There's more nuance to it, but am I getting that essentially correct? If so, does a true volatility index exist, moving up on big underlying movement and down on calm days? This would make it a fear/exuberance index.",

      "selftext": "I’m planning to reinvest part of my portfolio into a moderate risk “high growth savings” allocation. I’ve run several iterations over the past few weeks and I think this version is close to finalized. The goal is to capture long term upside from large cap AI leaders while balancing that exposure with broad market, growth, and large-cap ETFs. Essentially: high conviction + diversified stability. I’m open to suggestions. Current Allocation Proposal: 25% FSKAX – Total U.S. market exposure (small/mid caps, defensives, full sector diversification) 15% FSPGX – Large cap growth tilt without overly concentrating the portfolio 10% VUG – Additional high growth exposure with a low cost mega-cap focus 15% MSFT – Core AI & cloud leader 12% GOOG – Strong AI, ads, and cloud positioning; still attractively valued 12% META – Massive FCF with accelerating AI and social monetization 8% NVDA – AI infrastructure leader (kept at a disciplined weight for volatility control) 3% CRWD – cybersecurity growth kicker The intention is to build something that behaves like a high-yield savings engine over 5–10 years strong compounding, manageable volatility, and diversified enough to preserve capital for future opportunities (real estate, business acquisition, etc.). Open to adjustments or critiques.",

I ’ m open to suggestions . Current Allocation Proposal 25 % FSKAX – Total U.S. market exposure smallmid caps defensives full sector diversification 15 % FSPGX – Large cap growth tilt without overly concentrating the portfolio 10 % VUG – Additional high growth exposure with a low cost megacap focus 15 % MSFT – Core AI cloud leader 12 % GOOG – Strong AI ads and cloud positioning still attractively valued 12 % META – Massive FCF with accelerating AI and social monetization 8 % NVDA – AI infrastructure leader kept at a disciplined weight for volatility control 3 % CRWD – cybersecurity growth kicker The intention is to build something that behaves like a highyield savings engine over 5–10 years strong compounding manageable volatility and diversified enough to preserve capital for future opportunities real estate business acquisition etc ..

After losing some money by following trends and not knowing what i was doing, i was financially down a bit with some of my first investments as a person now in my 20s. But the past 2 weeks Ive been greening just about everyday. I know how to time when i stock shoots up, i know when to sell now. I know what to look for. I just really need payoff. I'm tired of seeing other people get their payday. I want to know my intuition will turn into something. I want this week to be one i remember. I know it’s about balance and not letting my emotions get in the way. Edit: Do not harass me and insult me for my posts about investing. It is my interest and it’s a public forum. If I am on topic there is no reason for these targets on my character. I have done nothing wrong but post about overcoming my losses with solid profit and trusting my own abilities.",

      "selftext": "Edit: What I mean to say is that I cost myself 10 years of work by following his advice - my fault - obviously he did not hold a gun to my head. Back then he was not a clown with a show... he was a fund manager just like the fund managers you see as guests on shows today (there was less internet and info back in 2000). Many of his strategies crashed too fast to get out in one piece and he was still recommending to buy more when they started to fall. Since then I have earned more money and invested in ETFs slowly working my way to retired. My goal is to let younger folks chasing 10x at high CAPE know that the individual recommendations did poorly when the bubble burst but the ETFs slowly and steady got to retirement goal. \\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In 2000 Jim Cramer went viral with his 'only 10 stocks to buy/own for the future'. He said he was buying them every day, especially if they went down, valuations were old fashioned... they were guaranteed 10-20x. # Jim Cramer's 'only 10 stocks to own for the future' 1. **724 Solutions** 2. **Ariba** 3. **Digital Island** 4. **Exodus Communications** 5. **InfoSpace** 6. **Inktomi** 7. **Mercury Interactive** 8. **Sonera** 9. **VeriSign** 10. **Veritas Software** Cramer's choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole. By contrast, the same initial $100,000 in a passive S&P 500 index investment would be worth **\\~$712,600** today. This is how taking Jim Cramer's recommendations made me work 10 extra years before I could retire (not hypothetical... true story). I'm just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for 'guaranteed 10x' and I still see Cramer fanboys... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up... the true challenge is who can predict success over time. Someone will say 'VeriSign' is/was great... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90% bad choices and resulted in a 50% loss over 25 years vs 700% gain if you ignored him and listened to Boggle. Young people may not think this is a big deal... but trust me... when you are old... having to work 10 more years is painful.",

      "selftext_processed": "Edit What I mean to say is that I cost myself 10 years of work by following his advice my fault obviously he did not_hold a gun to my head . Back then he was not_a clown with a show ... he was a fund manager just like the fund managers you see as guests on shows today there was less internet and info back in 2000 . Many of his strategies crashed too fast to get out in one piece and he was still recommending to buy more when they started to fall . Since then I have earned more money and invested in ETFs slowly working my way to retired . My goal is to let younger folks chasing 10x at high CAPE know that the individual recommendations did poorly when the bubble burst but the ETFs slowly and steady got to retirement goal . In 2000 Jim Cramer went viral with his only 10 stocks to buyown for the future . He said he was buying them every day especially if they went down valuations were old fashioned ... they were guaranteed 1020x . Jim Cramers only 10 stocks to own for the future 1 . 724 Solutions 2 . Ariba 3 . Digital Island 4 . Exodus Communications 5 . InfoSpace 6 . Inktomi 7 . Mercury Interactive 8 . Sonera 9 . VeriSign 10 . Veritas Software Cramers choices were soon mostly destroyed too fast to get out whole . By contrast the same initial $ 100000 in a passive SP 500 index investment would be worth $ 712600 today . This is how taking Jim Cramers recommendations made me work 10 extra years before I could retire not hypothetical ... true story . Im just sharing my story because I see posts in this channel looking for guaranteed 10x and I still see Cramer fanboys ... IMHO anyone can pick winners when the whole market is going up ... the true challenge is who can predict success over time . Someone will say VeriSign iswas great ... but that was insufficient to make up for the 90 % bad choices and resulted in a 50 % loss over 25 years vs 700 % gain if you ignored him and listened to Boggle . Young people may not_think this is a big deal ... but trust me ... when you are old ... having to work 10 more years is painful ."

      "title": "Advice on investing strategy, multiple ETFs to add diversification for riskier stock portfolio?",
      "selftext": "Hey folks, Relatively new investor here, just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund, looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security. I have a pretty high risk tolerance for \\~50% of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and \\~50% in long term 20+ year ETFs as retirement fund. Profile: 33M, single no kids, western Europe, low mortgage, low expenses, have a 3 month safety net, monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 - 500 per month with the following portfolio goal (note: my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation, so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs. My current portfolio (\\~30k) looks something like this: ETFs: \\- 30% Amundi Prime All-World (WEBN) \\- 10% Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc (LYP6) \\- 5% WisdomTree Europe Defence (EUDF) Stocks: \\- 30% - across 10 medium term high conviction Tech/AI: GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, META, AMD, AVGO, NBIS, SOFI, ASML \\- 20% - across 20 or so short-medium term low conviction Tech & Other stocks (I won´t list them but everything from AMZ, VRT, IREN, TSMC, MU, BABA, RKLB, ASTS and some utilities, raw materials etc, generally speculative plays. \\- 5% - I consider noise, learning experiences, minor investments of 5 - 50 eur which I´ll gradually close. Before you all jump down my throat, I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated. Given my risk profile, I am happy to keep 30 - 40% of portfolio within the growth/tech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble. I am also happy to keep 10% in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so. For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments. Eventually, as I get older and want more security, I will aim for 60-70% ETFs, maybe some other assets like gold/real estate/bonds etc, so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant. I´m considering adding something like FTSE All-World High Dividend Yield Acc (VHYG) or an Emerging Markets/ex-US fund. I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns, sector rotations, crashes. I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable, defensive, consumer/utility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions. I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s high-tech or high-US given the above allocation. Can you give me your thoughts on this? Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more? Should I stick to WEBN, LYP6 or any better alternatives? I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies, and want to allocate accordingly e.g. I do not want to invest in PLTR, APPL, TSLA for reasons. Lastly, I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO, QQQ and others. Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hey folks Relatively new investor here just started earlier this year with an inheritance fund looking for advice on this strategy and balancing risk with security . I have a pretty high risk tolerance for 50 % of my port in stocks for short to medium term gains and 50 % in long term 20 year ETFs as retirement fund . Profile 33M single no_kids western Europe low mortgage low expenses have a 3 month safety net monthly savings and aiming to invest 300 500 per month with the following portfolio goal note my current portfolio is a mess with many individual stocks I bought a small amount of when starting out as experimentation so I plan to sell off all the noise and increase my safety net in long term ETFs . My current portfolio 30k looks something like this ETFs 30 % Amundi Prime AllWorld WEBN 10 % Amundi STOXX Europe 600 Acc LYP6 5 % WisdomTree Europe Defence EUDF Stocks 30 % across 10 medium term high conviction TechAI GOOGL MSFT NVDA META AMD AVGO NBIS SOFI ASML 20 % across 20 or so shortmedium term low conviction Tech Other stocks I won´t list them but everything from AMZ VRT IREN TSMC MU BABA RKLB ASTS and some utilities raw materials etc generally speculative plays . 5 % I consider noise learning experiences minor investments of 5 50 eur which I´ll gradually close . Before you all jump down my throat I know I am overstretched and overcomplicated . Given my risk profile I am happy to keep 30 40 % of portfolio within the growthtech sector as that´s my main area of interest and I don´t believe my Top 10 above are going anywhere in the next 5 years regardless of AI bubble . I am also happy to keep 10 % in relatively speculative plays but will try to reduce that list to 10 companies or so . For this group I plan to trim regularly to fund the ETFs on top of regular monthly investments . Eventually as I get older and want more security I will aim for 6070 % ETFs maybe some other assets like goldreal estatebonds etc so my main question now is on the ETFs above and your thoughts on adding another or if this would be redundant . I´m considering adding something like FTSE AllWorld High Dividend Yield Acc VHYG or an Emerging MarketsexUS fund . I´m thinking these may offer broader exposure in the case of downturns sector rotations crashes . I´m attracted to high dividend ETF as they may be more stable defensive consumerutility companies but I don´t care for the payout of dividends just the exposure to broader sectors and regions . I´m naturally avoiding anything that´s hightech or highUS given the above allocation . Can you give me your thoughts on this Does an All world Dividend Accumulating ETF make sense or am I just overcomplicating it more Should I stick to WEBN LYP6 or any better alternatives I expect many of you will say to invest in a Tech sector ETF but I quite enjoy the picking and following and researching of the companies and want to allocate accordingly e.g . I do not_want to invest in PLTR APPL TSLA for reasons . Lastly I use T212 so many ETF tickers I see suggested in other threads here just aren´t available on that like VTO QQQ and others . Thanks"

On April 9th, with SWDA at -18%, I wasn't at all scared; in fact, I invested a significant amount of money, fully aware of market forces and with no particular aversion to risk. My question is this: am I the only relatively young and knowledgeable person investing in a Golden Butterfly portfolio? Everyone my age that I see on Reddit always seems to have a much higher percentage of stocks. Are people really that long-term oriented and that indifferent to short-term drops? Or do they simply overestimate their risk tolerance?",

On April 9th with SWDA at 18 % I wasnt at all scared in fact I invested a significant amount of money fully aware of market forces and with no_particular aversion to risk . My question is this am I the only relatively young and knowledgeable person investing in a Golden Butterfly portfolio Everyone my age that I see on Reddit always seems to have a much higher percentage of stocks . Are people really that longterm oriented and that indifferent to shortterm drops Or do they simply overestimate their risk tolerance"

      "selftext": "Wall Street rose for a fifth straight day to put the wraps on a volatile month. The S&P 500 rose 0.5% in abbreviated trading Friday and closed out November with a slim gain of 0.1%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 289 points, or 0.6%. The Nasdaq gained 0.7% but ended November with a drop of 1.5% because of losses for some big tech stocks. Stocks swooned in mid-month as investors worried that stocks boosted by the frenzy around artificial intelligence such as Nvidia had gotten too expensive. Nvidia lost 1.8% Friday and closed the month with a double-digit loss... CEXs like Bitget are providing their users with tokenized stocks to drade this volitile period and ramping up TV... others like Oracle fell 23% in November while Palantir Technologies sank 16%. Is this the end of the AI bubble or is this just the inherent volatility of the niche? Amid the volatilit y in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains. What are your next moves for December?",

I’ve been investing for almost 9 years, pretty happy with my results so far and have learned a ton along the way. In this account I leave a portion for swing trading (I’m a full time investor and treat this part as my active income), while the rest holding long term stocks. I don’t really diversify in my opinion I usually only hold on to no more than 5-6 stocks and it has worked out so far (these holdings have changed over time as I haven’t held any stock since I started investing). I like to research a ton and have high conviction before investing into something which has rewarded me with some pretty good gains. I’m not sure if I could do this with a diversified portfolio with a ton of companies, so I’m sticking with what has worked for me.

      "selftext": "It seems like Oracle’s performance in the stock market is largely based on its credit risk and whether or not it can pay off its debt. After its 2026 Q1 earnings it reported positive figures, and its stock price went up. But over time investors started selling the stock, causing its price to go down, out of fear of the risk its RPOs and debt presented. I wonder if a similar pattern might happen in Q2. This seems similar to bonds or tbill ETFs where they start going up until a maturity date (due to credit risk) at which point it crashes and the cycle restarts. Similarly, buying the dip has the highest risk and also the highest potential return,",

After its 2026 Q1 earnings it reported positive figures and its stock price went up . But over time investors started selling the stock causing its price to go down out of fear of the risk its RPOs and debt presented . I wonder if a similar pattern might happen in Q2 . This seems similar to bonds or tbill ETFs where they start going up until a maturity date due to credit risk at which point it crashes and the cycle restarts . Similarly buying the dip has the highest risk and also the highest potential return"

      "selftext": "Intel shares jumped as much as 10% on Friday, marking the stock's fifth consecutive session of gains, after analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reported that Apple is on track to have Intel manufacture its lowest-end M-series chips using the 18A process as early as mid-2027. The potential deal would involve production of approximately 15-20 million units annually for MacBook Air and iPad Pro devices, representing a cautious diversification of Apple's supply chain away from sole reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The rally came despite ongoing legal tensions with TSMC, including reports of a raid on an Intel executive's home in Taiwan related to allegations of stolen technology. Investors appeared to look past the litigation drama, focusing instead on the prospects of securing Apple as a foundry customer, which analysts described as having improved significantly. Intel led chip stocks higher on Friday, helping drive the broader S&P 500 to gains and turning the index positive for November. The stock outperformed competitors on heavy trading volume, with options activity notably elevated. The potential Apple partnership, while modest in scale compared to TSMC's high-end chip production for Apple, would mark a significant validation of Intel's foundry ambitions and its advanced 18A manufacturing process.",

      "selftext": "I always read tha WLI is a terrible investment, maybe it is for most people, but I'm wondering if it really is for those with high income and a decent amount of money invested already. Assume you make enough money to max out your 401k, HSA, and already have large amounts in stocks, real estate, and other alternative asset classes like crypto or gold. EDIT: you are not comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already. With an IRR of 3.5% over 30 years that you can access through tax-free loans (loan interest is covered by cash value interests), wouldn't WLI yield decent returns for retirement? Consider that at a tax rate of 40%, a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8% in IRR for the same after-tax money. EDIT: HYSA's yield about 3.5% pre-tax. EDIT: please don't simply reply \"yes\" or \"no\" without justification, this thread is not meant to be a vote FINAL EDIT & CONCLUSION: From y'all's comments, my take-away is that a WLI is complex and requires to sustain a high income/savings over 10+ years to start to see the advantages. As far as I'm concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bonds-like return-risk profile. In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its tax-deferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value. It also gives optionality for estate planning. I wouldn't recommend it to someone who doesn't have a solid, sustainable cash flow already (for instance already maxing out all tax-advantaged accounts). Thanks all !",

      "selftext_processed": "I always read tha WLI is a terrible investment maybe it is for most people but Im wondering if it really is for those with high income and a decent amount of money invested already . Assume you make enough money to max out your 401k HSA and already have large amounts in stocks real estate and other alternative asset classes like crypto or gold . EDIT you are not_comfortable adding more to stocks or RE as they represent a vast majority of the portfolio already . With an IRR of 3.5 % over 30 years that you can access through taxfree loans loan interest is covered by cash value interests wouldnt WLI yield decent returns for retirement Consider that at a tax rate of 40 % a taxable brokerage account would need 5.8 % in IRR for the same aftertax money . EDIT HYSAs yield about 3.5 % pretax . EDIT please dont simply reply yes or no without justification this thread is not_meant to be a vote FINAL EDIT CONCLUSION From yalls comments my takeaway is that a WLI is complex and requires to sustain a high incomesavings over 10 years to start to see the advantages . As far as Im concerned I would consider it as an emergency fund with bondslike returnrisk profile . In my situation it beats HYSA especially due to its taxdeferred advantage and ability to take loans against the cash value . It also gives optionality for estate planning . I wouldnt recommend it to someone who doesnt have a solid sustainable cash flow already for instance already maxing out all taxadvantaged accounts . Thanks all"

Whether it’s a company in a fast-growing sector, something heavily undervalued, or a business that’s on the edge of a major breakthrough what makes you believe it can go the distance?

Not by lying, but by moving normal revenue into the AI bucket and pushing a lot of the costs somewhere else. The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives. That never lasts forever and it usually makes the early margins look stronger than they really are. It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth, but the real costs showed up a few quarters later. I’m trying to figure out how much of the current AI excitement is real demand and how much is just accounting.",

Not_by lying but by moving normal revenue into the AI bucket and pushing a lot of the costs somewhere else . The part that stood out to me is how much of the early AI demand is coming from internal credits and vendor incentives . That never_lasts forever and it usually makes the early margins look stronger than they really are . It reminded me a lot of the early cloud stories where companies talked up growth but the real costs showed up a few quarters later . I ’ m trying to figure out how much of the current AI excitement is real demand and how much is just accounting ."

They have done the cost comparison and reporting and some crazy things came out of it! - Google software revamp to make it easier for companies to onboard chips. - This becomes a huge threat to Nvida as Cuda system is no longer the only monopoly for Ai chips. - Pricing for TpU is extremely cheap! At the 9k standard rack size, Google TpU are 2x cheaper then nvida Gpu. - what does this mean for GPU users? Google tpu will crush with margins. They are so cheap that Google cloud is becoming the go to cloud provider for companies as the pricing is just unbeatable. - nvida will most likely see margin compression to 60% in the next year or 2 as they need to start to under price to compete with TpU if Google floods the market. - OpenAi is in huge trouble. They have billions in commitments and billions in deployed GPU. But the price difference means they will see bad/negative margins for a while. Almost 1/2 trillion in losses for the next 5 years. Compute is expensive & seems like Google has cracked the code with TpU. - NeoClouds have been approached by Google and some have started to deploy the TpU at scale for cloud hosting. Initial trials to see how market response is. Other large customer amd contracts that have been rumored for $GOOGL is $META & Xai. Both who are huge nvida customers! This news will be digested over the weekend but my positions are set on this. I am in a pair trade with long $GOOGL shares + $AVGO calls and short on $NVDA/$AMD. It does seem like googles full stack approach is working well and we are seeing gemini take on other world models, Google cloud ☁️ dominance over Aws/AZURE and then ToU taking market share from Nvida.

      "selftext": "The foundation of the global financial system, Japan, is beginning to shift. For more than three decades, global asset prices including US Treasuries, technology stocks, and real estate have quietly depended on Japan’s ultra-low interest rate policy. This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade, where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higher-yielding global assets. The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades. In November 2025, that logic began to collapse. Yields on long-term Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades, with 20-year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40-year bonds nearing 3.7 percent. This is not a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression. The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability. As Japanese yields rise, funding costs climb worldwide, currency volatility spreads, and the unwinding of long-standing carry trades begins. Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in, tightening liquidity across global markets. The implications extend far beyond Japan. The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries, which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system. A stronger yen can pressure the dollar, forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets. What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system. Crypto markets, being the most liquidity-sensitive segment of global finance, are already showing signs of strain. As liquidity dries up, volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous. Traders are forced to adjust strategies, often moving from high-risk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans. In many ways, crypto acts as a real-time indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift. As global liquidity tightens, crypto’s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible. On one hand, its price action mirrors broader risk-off cycles as capital flees leverage. On the other, decentralized markets continue to function around the clock, offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress. Stablecoin redemptions, exchange outflows, and on-chain volume spikes serve as real-time indicators of changing sentiment. Meanwhile, traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility, shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions. In this new environment, the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not just as speculation but as infrastructure, a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance. But this environment also exposes another weakness, the fragility of market infrastructure. During periods of sharp volatility, execution delays, failed orders, and platform outages become common. In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often, reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment. Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed, security, and verifiable reserves, building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not. The world long assumed Japan would stay still. But now it is moving, and the ripple effect has only just begun. edit: Really appreciate all the insights in the comments, especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground. I didn’t expect this topic to spark so much discussion, but it’s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes. After reading through everyone’s replies, I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week’s swings. Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded. Out of curiosity, I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here, and to my surprise, execution was much smoother. Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves. It might not be the biggest name, but when markets go crazy, that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else.",

      "selftext_processed": "The foundation of the global financial system Japan is beginning to shift . For more than three decades global asset prices including US Treasuries technology stocks and real estate have quietly depended on Japan ’ s ultralow interest rate policy . This policy created a massive flow of capital known as the carry trade where investors borrowed yen at almost zero cost and used it to buy higheryielding global assets . The result was trillions of dollars in liquidity that quietly nourished the global financial system for decades . In November 2025 that logic began to collapse . Yields on longterm Japanese government bonds have surged to levels unseen in decades with 20year bonds approaching 2.8 percent and 40year bonds nearing 3.7 percent . This is not_a slow adjustment but more like a spring snapping after years of compression . The sharp move marks the end of an era when cheap yen quietly underpinned global asset growth and stability . As Japanese yields rise funding costs climb worldwide currency volatility spreads and the unwinding of longstanding carry trades begins . Capital that once flowed outward from Japan is now being pulled back in tightening liquidity across global markets . The implications extend far beyond Japan . The reversal of the yen carry trade affects global demand for US Treasuries which in turn influences yields and liquidity across the dollar system . A stronger yen can pressure the dollar forcing asset managers to rebalance global portfolios and potentially accelerate outflows from emerging markets . What we are seeing is a feedback loop where tightening in one corner of the financial world spreads through every connected system . Crypto markets being the most liquiditysensitive segment of global finance are already showing signs of strain . As liquidity dries up volatility increases and leverage becomes more dangerous . Traders are forced to adjust strategies often moving from highrisk plays to stable pairs or automated trading systems that can respond faster than humans . In many ways crypto acts as a realtime indicator of global liquidity stress as it reacts before most traditional markets even acknowledge the shift . As global liquidity tightens crypto ’ s dual nature as both a risk asset and a testbed for financial innovation becomes more visible . On one hand its price action mirrors broader riskoff cycles as capital flees leverage . On the other decentralized markets continue to function around the clock offering a live view of how liquidity redistributes itself under stress . Stablecoin redemptions exchange outflows and onchain volume spikes serve as realtime indicators of changing sentiment . Meanwhile traders are increasingly relying on automation and quantitative tools to navigate volatility shifting toward algorithmic strategies that can adapt faster than discretionary decisions . In this new environment the most resilient participants will be those who treat crypto not_just as speculation but as infrastructure a system evolving in parallel with the macro shifts reshaping global finance . But this environment also exposes another weakness the fragility of market infrastructure . During periods of sharp volatility execution delays failed orders and platform outages become common . In a world where macro shocks arrive faster and more often reliability and transparency in trading systems may prove more important than speculation or sentiment . Some exchanges are starting to invest heavily in speed security and verifiable reserves building systems designed to remain stable even when global liquidity is not_The world long assumed Japan would stay still . But now it is moving and the ripple effect has only just begun . edit Really appreciate all the insights in the comments especially those pointing out how these macro shifts connect to execution and liquidity on the ground . I didn ’ t expect this topic to spark so much discussion but it ’ s clear that many traders have faced the same frustration during volatility spikes . After reading through everyone ’ s replies I tested a few exchanges myself to see how they handled last week ’ s swings . Most of them still lagged badly whenever trading volume exploded . Out of curiosity I tried BYDFi since a few people mentioned it here and to my surprise execution was much smoother . Orders went through instantly even during sharp moves . It might not_be the biggest name but when markets go crazy that kind of consistency really matters more than anything else ."

These companies are borrowing massive amounts from banks like JPMorgan to build data centers, while taking on none of the actual risk. The banks are assuming the full exposure and are hoping to recover their investment over 17 years, even though the GPUs inside these facilities only have a usable life of about 3–5 years. That imbalance feels like a disaster in the making. Both the companies and the banks seem to be betting that the Federal Reserve will step in with taxpayer-funded support if this all goes wrong. I’ll DCA back in when I see the markets start to behave more rationally. I’m certain Trump and team will screw up something again soon, so plenty of opportunities ahead.",

These companies are borrowing massive amounts from banks like JPMorgan to build data centers while taking on none of the actual risk . The banks are assuming the full exposure and are hoping to recover their investment over 17 years even though the GPUs inside these facilities only have a usable life of about 3–5 years . That imbalance feels like a disaster in the making . Both the companies and the banks seem to be betting that the Federal Reserve will step in with taxpayerfunded support if this all goes wrong . I ’ ll DCA back in when I see the markets start to behave more rationally . I ’ m certain Trump and team will screw up something again soon so plenty of opportunities ahead ."

He claims that high-quality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity. He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source. The entry point seems accessible, starting from a couple thousand dollars, but to acquire something truly noteworthy, the investment would likely be in the range of $50,000 to $200,000. Has anyone had experience with this asset class? What are your thoughts on its potential and risks? Also, if you're knowledgeable, could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market?",

He claims that highquality stones can appreciate significantly each year and maintain good liquidity . He can offer wholesale prices directly from the source . The entry point seems accessible starting from a couple thousand dollars but to acquire something truly noteworthy the investment would likely be in the range of $ 50000 to $ 200000 . Has anyone had experience with this asset class What are your thoughts on its potential and risks Also if youre knowledgeable could you give a few examples of promising stones and their approximate price ranges in the current market"

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned .

OpenAI is not a public company but it is like the mascot of the AI companies and the startup companies.

From what I know, google will be very happy since their current business continues as usual, while they seriously release AI stuff. Same with Amazon and facebook, no affect to their business. I am guessing Microsoft may suffer a bit of a loss to their valuation since they got around 25+% share in OpenAI, IIRC.

Not_clear if or how stock lending affects K1 and I ’ m not_willing to find out the hard way . Finally not_recommended to hold MLP in a retirement account . It can lead to unrelated business taxable income ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m trying to choose the best brokerage platform for mainly long-term investing in **ETFs** and **individual stocks**, and I’d really appreciate some input from people with real-world experience. The five platforms I’m currently considering are: • **Interactive Brokers (IBKR)** • **DEGIRO** • **flatex** • **Trading212** • **GBE Brokers** I’m mainly a buy-and-hold investor. My priorities are: **1. Access to a wide range of ETFs / stocks** I want to make sure I can invest in: • major European-domiciled ETFs • US-listed ETFs (with W-8BEN) • individual stocks globally (EU, US, maybe Asia) If you use any of these platforms, how broad is their ETF/stock selection? **2. Cost efficiency** I care about: • commission fees • FX conversion fees • custody fees • any hidden/inactivity fees • spreads Which of these platforms ends up being *actually* the cheapest for long-term ETF investing? **3. Trustworthiness & security** Any red flags or concerns with any of these five? **4. Account currency & multi-currency support** My situation is: • I’m originally from the EU (so EUR is my “home currency”) • I currently earn income in **USD** • and also in **Thai Baht (THB)** So a broker that supports **multi-currency accounts** or **low FX costs** would be ideal, but not sure if that is possible. Right now my two main currencies are USD and THB. If you use any of these platforms with multiple currencies, how does it work in practice? **5. Overall experience** • UI / mobile app • deposit/withdrawal ease • customer support • reliability **TL;DR** If you had to choose one broker - mainly for building a long-term ETF + stock portfolio, and you could pick from Trading212, IBKR, DEGIRO, flatex, or GBE Brokers, **which one would you pick and why?** Thanks in advance for any insights!",

The five platforms I ’ m currently considering are • Interactive Brokers IBKR • DEGIRO • flatex • Trading212 • GBE Brokers I ’ m mainly a buyandhold investor . My priorities are 1 . Access to a wide range of ETFs stocks I want to make sure I can invest in • major Europeandomiciled ETFs • USlisted ETFs with W8BEN • individual stocks globally EU US maybe Asia If you use any of these platforms how broad is their ETFstock selection 2 . Cost efficiency I care about • commission fees • FX conversion fees • custody fees • any hiddeninactivity fees • spreads Which of these platforms ends up being actually the cheapest for longterm ETF investing 3 . Trustworthiness security Any red flags or concerns with any of these five 4 . Account currency multicurrency support My situation is • I ’ m originally from the EU so EUR is my “ home currency ” • I currently earn income in USD • and also in Thai Baht THB So a broker that supports multicurrency accounts or low FX costs would be ideal but not_sure if that is possible . Right now my two main currencies are USD and THB . If you use any of these platforms with multiple currencies how does it work in practice 5 . Overall experience • UI mobile app • depositwithdrawal ease • customer support • reliability TLDR If you had to choose one broker mainly for building a longterm ETF stock portfolio and you could pick from Trading212 IBKR DEGIRO flatex or GBE Brokers which one would you pick and why Thanks in advance for any insights"

      "selftext": "If you want long-term consistency in Forex, resilience matters more than finding the “perfect setup.” Here are a few practical tips that actually help: **1. Don’t depend on one strategy.** Markets change. Have at least a trend setup and a range setup so you’re not stuck when conditions shift. **2. Keep position sizing small.** Risk 0.5%–1% per trade. Most accounts blow up because of sizing, not bad entries. **3. Backtest but trust real results more.** Run your tests → forward-test → then trade small until you have 30–50 real trades that confirm your edge. **4. Make your rules simple and mechanical.** Clear entries, exits, stop-loss, and “no trade” conditions. Emotional trading kills consistency. **5. Accept losing streaks.** Even good systems have 5–7 losses in a row. Resilience is sticking to the plan anyway. **6. Review weekly, not every trade.** You learn more from patterns, not individual outcomes.",

      "title": "Nvidia just posted 57 billion in revenue are you buying the business or the price",
      "selftext": "Nvidia’s latest quarter was huge. Revenue was 57 billion dollars, up 62%year on year. Net income was 31.8 billion dollars, up 59%. Earnings per share reached 1.30 dollars, up 60%. Guidance for next quarter is revenue around 65 billion dollars with a small range and gross margin near 75%. The question now is pretty simple….. If you buy Nvidia at this level, are you paying for future cash flow or mainly taking over a price that several rounds of money already pushed up. A lot of people are basically thinking as long as the AI story holds, Nvidia is the main way to play it, putting the price at which it is traded in second place. That pulls more attention to a few mega caps and less to finding value in the rest of the market. If you zoom out, a big part of Nvidia’s growth was captured earlier by private and early public money. On the private side, there are new setups that break unlisted equity into smaller units that can be registered and tracked. Jarsy is one of the tools that try to map private shares into one to one on chain units and record who holds what, while rules and risk control are still being tested. This earnings report will likely push AI valuations higher again. For your own portfolio, trading swings in a few giant names and thinking about how early equity is sliced and allocated are two different games. One is about riding price moves, the other is about standing closer to the real assets before the story shows up in headline numbers. Curious how people in here see this trade off with Nvidia right now?",

      "selftext_processed": "Nvidia ’ s latest quarter was huge . Revenue was 57 billion dollars up 62 % year on year . Net income was 31.8 billion dollars up 59 % . Earnings per share reached 1.30 dollars up 60 % . Guidance for next quarter is revenue around 65 billion dollars with a small range and gross margin near 75 % . The question now is pretty simple… .. If you buy Nvidia at this level are you paying for future cash flow or mainly taking over a price that several rounds of money already pushed up . A lot of people are basically thinking as long as the AI story holds Nvidia is the main way to play it putting the price at which it is traded in second place . That pulls more attention to a few mega caps and less to finding value in the rest of the market . If you zoom out a big part of Nvidia ’ s growth was captured earlier by private and early public money . On the private side there are new setups that break unlisted equity into smaller units that can be registered and tracked . Jarsy is one of the tools that try to map private shares into one to one on chain units and record who holds what while rules and risk control are still being tested . This earnings report will likely push AI valuations higher again . For your own portfolio trading swings in a few giant names and thinking about how early equity is sliced and allocated are two different games . One is about riding price moves the other is about standing closer to the real assets before the story shows up in headline numbers . Curious how people in here see this trade off with Nvidia right now"

      "selftext": "Probably going to get ridiculed with this one, but here it goes... My wife and I have had a financial advisor for the past 3 years. She has given us some good advice and been helpful, considering we knew absolutely nothing about investing when we started our account with her. She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money, but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETF's that \"her team\" has chosen based on our risk assessment. I periodically receive buy & sell orders, which is nice to see that the account *is* in-fact being actively managed to a degree, but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the S&P 500, so they're really not beating the market. We pay her 1% of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an \"advisors fee\" and currently have roughly $450k in the account. When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole, but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by - CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started. I recently (fairly bluntly) asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1% advisors fee we pay if they're not beating the market. She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was \"the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds, retirement goals, tax deference strategies, etc.\". Okay, all makes sense and is respected, but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my son's 529 and she told me \"we don't do that\". What she meant was they don't have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity, and therefore couldn't make their 1% on it. That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives, fees, etc. But I ended up having to do all the research myself, which I realized wasn't nearly as scary as I thought it would have been. Still though, would have been nice if the $4,500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself... I'm starting to feel - especially from reading others' sentiments on this subreddit - that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected, and/or for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves - i.e. have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25% and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear. My wife and I are both very young and, barring nothing unexpected, should not need this money for quite a long time. As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not touch it for another 25+ years. Over that much time, that 1% fee we're paying adds up to a good chunk of money, esp. when factoring in compounding interest. I'm not trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible, esp. if there is good reason to be paying it. But it's certainly not nothing, and I wouldn't mind it if I felt like we were actually *getting* something for paying it. Is this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1% back into our pocket and just do something like VT & chill? Or do I just stay the course, let her and her team continue \"managing\" everything, and when if/when we need the help I have someone readily available to me?",

      "selftext_processed": "Probably going to get ridiculed with this one but here it goes ... My wife and I have had a financial advisor for the past 3 years . She has given us some good advice and been helpful considering we knew absolutely nothing_about investing when we started our account with her . She provided some great options to us for what to do with our money but the only main thing we currently do is have a brokerage account invested in various ETFs that her team has chosen based on our risk assessment . I periodically receive buy sell orders which is nice to see that the account is infact being actively managed to a degree but the returns over the past 3 years have mimicked that of the SP 500 so theyre really not_beating the market . We pay her 1 % of our portfolio on a yearly basis as an advisors fee and currently have roughly $ 450k in the account . When we first started with her we were really clueless to investing as a whole but over the years I have taken the time to learn enough to get by CONSIDERABLY more than I knew when we started . I recently fairly bluntly asked her what ROI we are receiving for the 1 % advisors fee we pay if theyre not_beating the market . She gave me the generic answer I assumed she would which was the advisors fee is for financial guidance as it pertains to college funds retirement goals tax deference strategies etc .. Okay all makes sense and is respected but the kicker is a few weeks prior I had asked for help setting up my sons 529 and she told me we dont do that . What she meant was they dont have the ability to actively manage it through Fidelity and therefore couldnt make their 1 % on it . That rubbed me the wrong way because I would have at least expected her to offer assistance in choosing the best 529 plan and portfolio for my son based on things like state tax incentives fees etc . But I ended up having to do all the research myself which I realized wasnt nearly as scary as I thought it would have been . Still though would have been nice if the $ 4500 a year I am paying them would have saved me the time in doing the homework myself ... Im starting to feel especially from reading others sentiments on this subreddit that an advisor is primarily for someone nearing retirement age who needs to have a really good strategy with their money so they are protected andor for someone who is way too emotional to manage their account themselves i.e . have someone there to talk them off a ledge when the market drops 25 % and they would otherwise make a bad move at the wrong time out of fear . My wife and I are both very young and barring nothing_unexpected should not_need this money for quite a long time . As it currently stands I would love for this to ultimately be our retirement fund and not_touch it for another 25 years . Over that much time that 1 % fee were paying adds up to a good chunk of money esp . when factoring in compounding interest . Im not_trying to be stingy and just pocket as much money as possible esp . if there is good reason to be paying it . But its certainly not_nothing and I wouldnt mind it if I felt like we were actually getting something for paying it . Is this a situation where it would make way more sense to stick that 1 % back into our pocket and just do something like VT chill Or do I just stay the course let her and her team continue managing everything and when ifwhen we need the help I have someone readily available to me"

      "title": "OpenAI’s 200m paying user goal by 2030 is delusional. Here is the bear case nobody talks about.",
      "selftext": "Saw the news that OpenAI expects to hit 220 million paying users by 2030. That is roughly 14x their current subscriber count. I have been crunching the numbers and looking at the competitive landscape since the Gemini 3.0 / Claude Opus 4.5 releases, and honestly? The math is broken. There is a massive bias in this sub and on Reddit in general. We are the power users. We are the ones digging into specific use cases or coding workflows. But we are a tiny bubble. The vast majority of OpenAI’s 800M+ weekly active users are free-tier casuals who use it to write a birthday email or summarize a PDF. They have zero loyalty because \"good enough\" is all they need. Here is my analysis why the fundamentals won't support the valuation: 1. The \"Amazon\" comparison is lazy People keep saying \"Amazon wasn't profitable for 20 years\" to justify OpenAI burning billions. It is a bad comparison. Amazon spent money building warehouses, logistics networks, and eventually their own data centers. They were building assets they owned. The spend was on Capex. OpenAI is spending billions on Opex. They are renting compute from Microsoft and Oracle. Look at the numbers: they have a $300 Billion commitment to Oracle and over $22 Billion committed to CoreWeave. They do not own the infrastructure. They are renting the penthouse. If Amazon stopped spending, they still had a massive delivery network. If OpenAI stops spending, the server lights go out immediately. 2. Startup 101: Validate, Dominate, then Expand Normally, to become a platform, you dominate one vertical first. Amazon dominated books. Google dominated search. Once you have the cash flow and the users, you expand. OpenAI is trying to skip the \"dominate\" phase. They are throwing spaghetti at the wall. Search, Voice, Canvas, Sora, Shopping. They are trying to disrupt markets without validating the demand first. Meanwhile, they are losing the one vertical they actually had. Recent data suggests Anthropic has already flipped the enterprise API market, taking a 30%+ share while OpenAI slides down to 25% because developers prefer Claude for coding. 3. The Google Trap Most users are on the free plan. What happens if OpenAI forces them to pay? They leave. What happens if they flood the chat with ads to monetize the free users? They leave. Google knows this. They are likely just waiting for OpenAI to break the user experience to capture the churn. The \"Gemini for Students\" move was genius because it gets users hooked on the ecosystem (Docs/Drive) for free. (600 Mio Gemini users! App, not including search! Probably highly overlapping with OpenAI's userbase). When OpenAI puts up a wall, Google will be there with open arms to capture the 98% of users who won't pay $20/month. 4. The AGI Hype vs. Reality We need to be real about the tech. Transformers are just huge attention networks creating probabilistic links between words. They are non-deterministic. They do not \"think\" or understand physics. You cannot build a safe AGI on a system that is fundamentally a randomizer. This is why the experts are leaving. Ilya Sutskever left to start SSI. John Schulman left. Yann LeCunn left Meta. In late 2025 alone, over 20 top researchers left OpenAI and Google to work on \"World Models\" because they know Transformers have hit a ceiling. Also, do not fall for the CEO marketing trap. When Sam Altman says \"I am afraid this tech will destroy us,\" that is just hype generation. Danger implies capability. It is the best way to mask the fact that the models are plateauing. 5. The Financials are a Horror Show Let’s look at the actual 2025 numbers that have leaked. For the first half of 2025, they generated about $4.3 Billion in revenue. Sounds good? Not when you see the burn. Reports suggest they lost nearly $13.5 Billion in the same period. Even worse, Microsoft’s earnings leaks implied OpenAI lost another $12 Billion just in Q3 2025. They are burning cash faster than they can print it. The \"circular financing\" loop (Nvidia invests -> OpenAI buys chips -> Nvidia books revenue) is the only thing propping up the narrative. When you are losing $3 for every $1 you make, you are not a platform. You are a subsidy machine for Microsoft's cloud division. And if the circular revenue doesn't scare you, look at the employee compensation timebomb. OpenAI doesn't give normal stock; they give PPUs (Profit Participation Units). Because of their capped-profit structure, these aren't ownership stakes, but moreover promises of future profit distributions. As the valuation skyrockets to ~$500B, the accounting value of these \"promises\" explodes. On a balance sheet, this scales like a massive liability. If they ever want to IPO or convert to a standard Public Benefit Corporation (which they are desperately trying to do right now/are in proceeds to do), they have to convert these PPUs. That conversion would trigger a compensation expense so large it would likely wipe out their \"paper\" profits for the next decade. They are effectively borrowing against their own hype to pay their staff. 6. Zero Moat People argue that \"Chat History\" is a moat. It isn't. I exported my ChatGPT history to JSON and imported it into a local client in 5 minutes. Switching from ChatGPT to Gemini 3.0 took me 30 seconds. Conclusion I have to end with a question. The people running OpenAI are YC alums and some of the smartest minds in tech. They know how startups work. They know you need to validate problems and dominate verticals. Yet everything they are doing screams the exact opposite. Are they just bad at productizing, where overhelmed by the hype of LLMs themself and strategically not prepared or is there some 4D chess strategy here that I am completely missing? Because from where I am standing, they look less like Google and more like Uber in 2015.",

      "selftext_processed": "Saw the news that OpenAI expects to hit 220 million paying users by 2030 . That is roughly 14x their current subscriber count . I have been crunching the numbers and looking at the competitive landscape since the Gemini 3.0 Claude Opus 4.5 releases and honestly The math is broken . There is a massive bias in this sub and on Reddit in general . We are the power users . We are the ones digging into specific use cases or coding workflows . But we are a tiny bubble . The vast majority of OpenAI ’ s 800M weekly active users are freetier casuals who use it to write a birthday email or summarize a PDF . They have zero loyalty because good enough is all they need . Here is my analysis why the fundamentals wont support the valuation 1 . The Amazon comparison is lazy People keep saying Amazon wasnt profitable for 20 years to justify OpenAI burning billions . It is a bad comparison . Amazon spent money building warehouses logistics networks and eventually their own data centers . They were building assets they owned . The spend was on Capex . OpenAI is spending billions on Opex . They are renting compute from Microsoft and Oracle . Look at the numbers they have a $ 300 Billion commitment to Oracle and over $ 22 Billion committed to CoreWeave . They do not_own the infrastructure . They are renting the penthouse . If Amazon stopped spending they still had a massive delivery network . If OpenAI stops spending the server lights go out immediately . 2 . Startup 101 Validate Dominate then Expand Normally to become a platform you dominate one vertical first . Amazon dominated books . Google dominated search . Once you have the cash flow and the users you expand . OpenAI is trying to skip the dominate phase . They are throwing spaghetti at the wall . Search Voice Canvas Sora Shopping . They are trying to disrupt markets without validating the demand first . Meanwhile they are losing the one vertical they actually had . Recent data suggests Anthropic has already flipped the enterprise API market taking a 30 % share while OpenAI slides down to 25 % because developers prefer Claude for coding . 3 . The Google Trap Most users are on the free plan . What happens if OpenAI forces them to pay They leave . What happens if they flood the chat with ads to monetize the free users They leave . Google knows this . They are likely just waiting for OpenAI to break the user experience to capture the churn . The Gemini for Students move was genius because it gets users hooked on the ecosystem DocsDrive for free . 600 Mio Gemini users App not_including search Probably highly overlapping with OpenAIs userbase . When OpenAI puts up a wall Google will be there with open arms to capture the 98 % of users who wont pay $ 20month . 4 . The AGI Hype vs . Reality We need to be real about the tech . Transformers are just huge attention networks creating probabilistic links between words . They are nondeterministic . They do not_think or understand physics . You can not build a safe AGI on a system that is fundamentally a randomizer . This is why the experts are leaving . Ilya Sutskever left to start SSI . John Schulman left . Yann LeCunn left Meta . In late 2025 alone over 20 top researchers left OpenAI and Google to work on World Models because they know Transformers have hit a ceiling . Also do not_fall for the CEO marketing trap . When Sam Altman says I am afraid this tech will destroy us that is just hype generation . Danger implies capability . It is the best way to mask the fact that the models are plateauing . 5 . The Financials are a Horror Show Let ’ s look at the actual 2025 numbers that have leaked . For the first half of 2025 they generated about $ 4.3 Billion in revenue . Sounds good Not_when you see the burn . Reports suggest they lost nearly $ 13.5 Billion in the same period . Even worse Microsoft ’ s earnings leaks implied OpenAI lost another $ 12 Billion just in Q3 2025 . They are burning cash faster than they can print it . The circular financing loop Nvidia invests OpenAI buys chips Nvidia books revenue is the only thing propping up the narrative . When you are losing $ 3 for every $ 1 you make you are not_a platform . You are a subsidy machine for Microsofts cloud division . And if the circular revenue doesnt scare you look at the employee compensation timebomb . OpenAI doesnt give normal stock they give PPUs Profit Participation Units . Because of their cappedprofit structure these arent ownership stakes but moreover promises of future profit distributions . As the valuation skyrockets to $ 500B the accounting value of these promises explodes . On a balance sheet this scales like a massive liability . If they ever want to IPO or convert to a standard Public Benefit Corporation which they are desperately trying to do right noware in proceeds to do they have to convert these PPUs . That conversion would trigger a compensation expense so large it would likely wipe out their paper profits for the next decade . They are effectively borrowing against their own hype to pay their staff . 6 . Zero Moat People argue that Chat History is a moat . It isnt . I exported my ChatGPT history to JSON and imported it into a local client in 5 minutes . Switching from ChatGPT to Gemini 3.0 took me 30 seconds . Conclusion I have to end with a question . The people running OpenAI are YC alums and some of the smartest minds in tech . They know how startups work . They know you need to validate problems and dominate verticals . Yet everything they are doing screams the exact opposite . Are they just bad at productizing where overhelmed by the hype of LLMs themself and strategically not_prepared or is there some 4D chess strategy here that I am completely missing Because from where I am standing they look less like Google and more like Uber in 2015 ."

      "selftext": "I currently have a youth brokerage account on Fidelity, and I have about 56% of my money invested in FXAIX (the S&P 500 fund of Fidelity). I’m unsure what I should do with the rest of it, the other 44%. I don’t have a job (am underage), so I am not getting the same tax benefits someone with a Roth IRA would get. That is fine - once I get a job / am older, I will transfer the money from FXAIX into a Roth IRA. I don’t know how or where I should invest at my age... I think I want to save what I have right now primarily for retirement instead of for a house or other large payment, since I know time in the market is the most important aspect of investing. Should I increase the % of my balance in FXAIX, since it is a long term investment? Or should I take more risks since I am still very young? And whatever % I don’t invest into FXAIX - what should I do with that money? For example - if I invest 80% of my money into FXAIX and have 20% of it left, should the 20% be split up into gold, silver, crypto, NASDAQ, etc.? I mainly just want to know what I should invest in, since there are so many junk videos on YouTube telling me to invest everything into the “next big crypto currency” and I don’t know what I should listen to. I want to have some variety but at the same time have a good portion of my account be based on the S&P 500. I don‘t like the idea of day-trading because of the risk, but I do want to take some risks on possibly specific, small tech funds or single companies… etc, even if this is just 1-2% of my money (ex: my friend told me to invest in BBAI, which seems extremely risky. I’d be fine investing in this, just not with most of my money). Any specific stocks or funds? Businesses? Real estate (not that I have enough for that at the moment). Last thing - should I invest outside of the U.S. too? Likely because of the way google searches are made to fit your location, I haven’t really been hearing much about investing outside of the U.S. Is this important to do? If anyone is kind enough to share exactly what their portfolio looks like too - that would be awesome! Thank you everyone.",

      "selftext": "In the 1980s & 90s, bond investors would dump U.S. treasuries to protest what they perceived as overly-generous government spending or artificially low interest rates from the Federal Reserve. But today, they’re nowhere to be found. The 10-year treasury yield, which historically tended to track *nominal* U.S. GDP growth (currently at a ~5% annualized rate YTD, from ~2% real growth + ~3% inflation), is currently only ~3.9%. Inflation has been stuck at ~3% or higher for 5 years. Instead, today’s bond investors have an asymmetric reaction function in which any piece of negative economic news they could cling to causes yields to plunge (including soft data like consumer sentiment surveys, or private-sector reports like ADP & ISM), while it takes a lot of sustained good news to push yields slightly higher. The $4 trillion One Big Bill price tag, $38 trillion national debt, and now politically-compromised Federal Reserve haven’t caused Treasury investors to blink. Yields have continued to fall. I think central bank Q.E. changed everything. Bond investors enjoyed outsized returns in 2008 & 2020 as central banks drove bond prices far above fair market value. It’s understandable they’re always trying to time the next windfall. Today, even with a 4% cushion in the federal funds rate to combat future recessions, Federal Reserve officials have not sworn off future usage of Q.E. Wall Street loves Q.E. Are treasury prices in a permanently high plateau? It should be noted that even with 2022’s “taper tantrum” & inflation shock, yields are only back to where they were in 2007 and lower than the entire half-century preceding the financial crisis.",

      "title": "Broadcom DD: Highly overvalued",
      "selftext": "As of today, Broadcom's marketcap is roughly 1.8T (it's closer to 1.9T but still) Nvidia's marketcap in comparison is roughly 4.3T This brings Broadcom at about 40% valuation of Nvidia Now Broadcom made about 15.9 B dollars in profit, for a 4.2 B in Net Revenue. About 9.2 B ( \\~ 60%) comes from Semiconductor related business And the rest, 6.8 B (\\~ 40%) comes from Software Now Broadcom bought VMware and increased prices by a lot, so much that they gained a lot of ill-will, and those who can try to get out of their ecosystem. They are taking a page out of Oracle's book, and this will hold companies hostage for a while, but the price increases are so insane, going up to 10x, that some companies either must find an alternative, or risk going bankrupt. \\[1\\] \\[2\\] I believe, Broadcom will stagnate in growth in their software department, but will increase prices to bleed dry existing customers as much as they can, the issue is in the VM space, there are some big players, such as Microsoft and already existing open source projects such as ProxMox that is gaining tractions \\[3\\] But This isn't what I want to talk about, and this isn't the reason for their latest rally, it's their semiconductor division, and the latest google TPU Meta deal. Broadcom has a gross margin of roughly 67% I am going to reasonably assume that they have a way higher margin on their software division compared to their chips division. I am going to assume a reasonable, yet very optimistic gross margin of 60% on their chip divisions, slightly higher than what Qualcom or Marvel gets, which designed and helped fab Amazon's AI chips. This leaves roughly 75% gross margin for their software division. I believe their software margins are way higher, and their chip divisions are lower but it doesn't matter. Their operating margins are way lower, at 26%. So on purely current revenue and profitability, I am going to compare to Nvidia's Q2 to make it fairer, since they have more than 2 months delay between their earnings. in Q2 Nvidia had a gross revenue of 45 B, or almost 3x (2.9x) Broadcom's Q3 revenue In Terms of Net Income Nvidia did 26.4B, which is even more drastic of a difference compared to Broadcom's 6.2x ! So this puts proportionally Broadcom at 40 % valuation of Nvidia, does 34 % Gross Revenue, But 16 % Net Revenue For the sake of the argument, If Nvidia went full panic mode, and decreased their insane margins to undercut Broadcom, at 20% margins, Nvidia would still do 9B in revenue, which is more than 2x what Broadcom does now. Now in terms of the future, they helped design googles TPUs but google owns the IP. And in the openAI deal, openAI is to design and own the IP (And Microsoft will also have rights due to their arrangements, so Broadcom will be paid to help the design and in the manufacturing, but they aren't going further than this. EDIT 1 Growth: I wanted to add a section on growth, Q3 saw a 6 % growth overall from Q2 and a 22% YoY In terms of the Chip division, it saw a roughly 9% increase from Q2 Their own projections for Q4 expect a 9 % growth from Q3 This is below both nvidia's and AMD Q/Q growth This is why Broadcom only shows YoY growth and not Q/Q like AMD or Nvidia, to make their growth look better. Based on this, Broadcom would have to 6x their semiconductor revenue in 2026 to justify their current valuation, which does not reflect at all their current growth. Current projections include existing google TPU demand, so even if you double it to include say openAI demand, it is still not realistic to hit such levels. EDIT 2 Debt: Broadcom also has lots of debt, they took a bit of short term debt, a small increase from 2024 at 1.4 B But they also have a 62 B long term debt Even if they are decreasing debt from 2024, they still have a an insane debt to revenue as well as equity ratio. Both AMD and Nvidia have proportionally way less debt. 1: [ 2: [ 3: [",

      "selftext_processed": "As of today Broadcoms marketcap is roughly 1.8T its closer to 1.9T but still Nvidias marketcap in comparison is roughly 4.3T This brings Broadcom at about 40 % valuation of Nvidia Now Broadcom made about 15.9 B dollars in profit for a 4.2 B in Net Revenue . About 9.2 B 60 % comes from Semiconductor related business And the rest 6.8 B 40 % comes from Software Now Broadcom bought VMware and increased prices by a lot so much that they gained a lot of illwill and those who can try to get out of their ecosystem . They are taking a page out of Oracles book and this will hold companies hostage for a while but the price increases are so insane going up to 10x that some companies either must find an alternative or risk going bankrupt . 1 2 I believe Broadcom will stagnate in growth in their software department but will increase prices to bleed dry existing customers as much as they can the issue is in the VM space there are some big players such as Microsoft and already existing open source projects such as ProxMox that is gaining tractions 3 But This isnt what I want to talk about and this isnt the reason for their latest rally its their semiconductor division and the latest google TPU Meta deal . Broadcom has a gross margin of roughly 67 % I am going to reasonably assume that they have a way higher margin on their software division compared to their chips division . I am going to assume a reasonable yet very optimistic gross margin of 60 % on their chip divisions slightly higher than what Qualcom or Marvel gets which designed and helped fab Amazons AI chips . This leaves roughly 75 % gross margin for their software division . I believe their software margins are way higher and their chip divisions are lower but it doesnt matter . Their operating margins are way lower at 26 % . So on purely current revenue and profitability I am going to compare to Nvidias Q2 to make it fairer since they have more than 2 months delay between their earnings . in Q2 Nvidia had a gross revenue of 45 B or almost 3x 2.9x Broadcoms Q3 revenue In Terms of Net Income Nvidia did 26.4B which is even more drastic of a difference compared to Broadcoms 6.2x So this puts proportionally Broadcom at 40 % valuation of Nvidia does 34 % Gross Revenue But 16 % Net Revenue For the sake of the argument If Nvidia went full panic mode and decreased their insane margins to undercut Broadcom at 20 % margins Nvidia would still do 9B in revenue which is more than 2x what Broadcom does now . Now in terms of the future they helped design googles TPUs but google owns the IP . And in the openAI deal openAI is to design and own the IP And Microsoft will also have rights due to their arrangements so Broadcom will be paid to help the design and in the manufacturing but they arent going further than this . EDIT 1 Growth I wanted to add a section on growth Q3 saw a 6 % growth overall from Q2 and a 22 % YoY In terms of the Chip division it saw a roughly 9 % increase from Q2 Their own projections for Q4 expect a 9 % growth from Q3 This is below both nvidias and AMD QQ growth This is why Broadcom only shows YoY growth and not_QQ like AMD or Nvidia to make their growth look better . Based on this Broadcom would have to 6x their semiconductor revenue in 2026 to justify their current valuation which does not_reflect at all their current growth . Current projections include existing google TPU demand so even if you double it to include say openAI demand it is still not_realistic to hit such levels . EDIT 2 Debt Broadcom also has lots of debt they took a bit of short term debt a small increase from 2024 at 1.4 B But they also have a 62 B long term debt Even if they are decreasing debt from 2024 they still have a an insane debt to revenue as well as equity ratio . Both AMD and Nvidia have proportionally way less debt . 1 2 3"

Apparently the recent “soft landing” vibes from multiple Fed officials especially Williams were enough for JPM s economists to rethink their whole call. They’re now expecting **two 25 bps cuts: Dec + Jan**. As someone who s been in this market long enough to see the Fed whiplash more times than I can count… this one caught my eye. If the Fed really opens the door in December, that’s a very different setup for year-end positioning than what most of us were planning even a few days ago. My questions for you all: * Does a December cut actually make sense here, or is JPM just chasing the narrative? * How are you positioning into year-end if this becomes the consensus? * Anyone else feel like the Fed’s “data dependent” line is basically mood-dependent at this point? Curious how everyone s reading this, because this shift could change the whole risk-on/risk-off balance heading into Q4.",

How does the purchase of a Bitcoin contribute or promote anything that we need more of in our society? When we (collectively) lose sight of what we are investing in and think of investing as merely a ‘bet’ that someone will pay more for a stock or a crypto-token in the future, we lose sight of what makes an economy strong. The benefit of a strong economy is that we produce goods and services that we want to consume. Placing ‘bets’ without any thought to whether your money supports the production of desirable goods and services will assuredly lead to a society devoid of desirable goods and services. Having a larger personal share of the total economic wealth of a society is only a good thing if you produced and contributed value. We need to hold each other accountable. Only pay for value and quality; don’t spend money on crap. From an investment perspective, INVEST in the things that you want to promote - better technology, healthcare, energy efficiency, food production, entertainment.",

Is this a viable strategy? And if so, should I wait until the stock market falls in this special instance before converting to stocks?

      "title": "A topic on profiting with TQQQ",
      "selftext": "I am sure many people immediately freaked out reading the title - 3x leveraged ETF is NOT investing, it's gambling, the decay will eat all your profit, the risk is too high. In certain situations, these are all true, and they read these from somewhere, a book, an online article, reddit, etc. But, with knowledge and discipline, TQQQ can be an excellent investment vehicle with unproportionally high upside vs relatively small down side risk. Using one of my own investment (or trading, whatever you feel like to call it) example, in 2022, TQQQ crashed hard from 80 to 30 (pre-split number, today's number would be 40 to 15). I work in tech, so I checked the numbers from leading tech companies, and their revenue and profit were stronger than ever. It was clearly an oversold situation. I divided my money in 5 portions and began loading TQQQ every month, initially the market continued dropping but eventually hit the bottom and began rebounding. After finished loading, the average cost was around $27 (or $13.5 after split). I held on to them and began unloading starting from $75, eventually sold everything, with a \\~3x gain in less than a year, with little risk or loss of sleep. Now, why it was a low risk with great upside? For a few reasons: 1. **First**, the underlying security is QQQ, an all tech index, it's not an individual stock that may go belly up. QQQ will never go bankrupt. 2. **Second**, the market was significantly oversold, the risk of going down is much lower than going up. I made the judgement by looking at the business health of the big tech. Plus, I work in tech so I am confident I didn't miss anything important. 3. **Third**, how about the decay risk? It's real but it's greatly exaggerated. It's also ignorable if the market goes mainly one direction. I made an Excel model to compute different scenarios and the risk of losing money was much much lower than making money. 4. **Fourth**, QQQ being an index is the biggest defense of any individual stock risk. I was tempted to load up $Meta at $90, which would go up 7X. But eventually I decided to stay with the index and let leverage amplify the returns. Many people blindly follow what they read, diversify, no leverage, and I see too many people wasting their money on mediocre stocks falling behind index, or missing once in a life opportunity to become financial free during market crash. I've been trading for 15 years and has been losing for the first 7-8, during which I did most people did - I diversify, I found 'undervalued' stocks, which never came back, I hedge my long which bleeded gain, etc. Not until a few years ago did I find my comfort place. One is the deep knowledge with big tech, which allows me to all in and hold on. The other is using market crash as an opportunity. TQQQ is one great way to amplify the overselling during market crash, which is almost certain followed by a rocket like comeback. I actually have a great way to combine TQQQ and SQQQ to gain with 0 risk but the gain would be much smaller so I am willing to take a bit risk in exchange with much higher gains. There's another trading during quick and deep market crash (e.g. the one during liberation day) that easily get you gains with very little risk. It's related to VIX and you can find it if you look and think. Ever since I found how to profit from market crashes, I no longer fear bloody red days, they made me excited. Investing is not about reading books, 'following advices' blindly. **Investing is about thinking, real thinking, deep thinking, finding strategy that fits your financial situation, domain knowledge, and personality.** For me, I am not afraid of risks, so I am willing to take calculated risks. But that may not be you, but you need to find a way that fits your personality. At the end of the day, your strategy must have better returns than SPY. Otherwise, why bother? Just buy VOO and forget.

      "selftext_processed": "I am sure many people immediately freaked out reading the title 3x leveraged ETF is NOT_investing its gambling the decay will eat all your profit the risk is too high . In certain situations these are all true and they read these from somewhere a book an online article reddit etc . But with knowledge and discipline TQQQ can be an excellent investment vehicle with unproportionally high upside vs relatively small down side risk . Using one of my own investment or trading whatever you feel like to call it example in 2022 TQQQ crashed hard from 80 to 30 presplit number todays number would be 40 to 15 . I work in tech so I checked the numbers from leading tech companies and their revenue and profit were stronger than ever . It was clearly an oversold situation . I divided my money in 5 portions and began loading TQQQ every month initially the market continued dropping but eventually hit the bottom and began rebounding . After finished loading the average cost was around $ 27 or $ 13.5 after split . I held on to them and began unloading starting from $ 75 eventually sold everything with a 3x gain in less than a year with little risk or loss of sleep . Now why it was a low risk with great upside For a few reasons 1 . First the underlying security is QQQ an all tech index its not_an individual stock that may go belly up . QQQ will never_go bankrupt . 2 . Second the market was significantly oversold the risk of going down is much lower than going up . I made the judgement by looking at the business health of the big tech . Plus I work in tech so I am confident I didnt miss anything important . 3 . Third how about the decay risk Its real but its greatly exaggerated . Its also ignorable if the market goes mainly one direction . I made an Excel model to compute different scenarios and the risk of losing money was much much lower than making money . 4 . Fourth QQQ being an index is the biggest defense of any individual stock risk . I was tempted to load up $ Meta at $ 90 which would go up 7X . But eventually I decided to stay with the index and let leverage amplify the returns . Many people blindly follow what they read diversify no_leverage and I see too many people wasting their money on mediocre stocks falling behind index or missing once in a life opportunity to become financial free during market crash . Ive been trading for 15 years and has been losing for the first 78 during which I did most people did I diversify I found undervalued stocks which never_came back I hedge my long which bleeded gain etc . Not_until a few years ago did I find my comfort place . One is the deep knowledge with big tech which allows me to all in and hold on . The other is using market crash as an opportunity . TQQQ is one great way to amplify the overselling during market crash which is almost certain followed by a rocket like comeback . I actually have a great way to combine TQQQ and SQQQ to gain with 0 risk but the gain would be much smaller so I am willing to take a bit risk in exchange with much higher gains . Theres another trading during quick and deep market crash e.g . the one during liberation day that easily get you gains with very little risk . Its related to VIX and you can find it if you look and think . Ever since I found how to profit from market crashes I no_longer fear bloody red days they made me excited . Investing is not_about reading books following advices blindly . Investing is about thinking real thinking deep thinking finding strategy that fits your financial situation domain knowledge and personality . For me I am not_afraid of risks so I am willing to take calculated risks . But that may not_be you but you need to find a way that fits your personality . At the end of the day your strategy must have better returns than SPY . Otherwise why bother Just buy VOO and forget . I posted initially in value investing but dont know why mod removed it"

      "selftext": "I got some advice here and elsewhere that I should do a reverse rollover of my IRA into my 401k so that I would be able to do a backdoor Roth. I ended up losing about 2% of my investments and counting in the process and it is not even over yet. You have to liquidate your assets in your IRA in order to do a reverse rollover. For me this was investments like index funds and some stocks I had hand picked after finally starting investing this year at the age of 40. I was worried about market volatility since I was going to be out of the market while the funds move from the IRA to 401k. I tried to do it now before December’s rate cut meeting approached so as to avoid having to sell low and buy high in case there was going to be a big rate cut rally. Sadly right after I sold a rumor of a December rate cut started spreading and the market has been rallying about 1% a day. Had I just stayed put, I would finally have seen some gains or added to gain in my investments after having done a late start to investments in my life. It is discouraging. PSA: while you may not be as unlucky as me be careful moving money in and out of accounts if it forces you to be out of the market even for a few days. This also happens when you switch employers sometimes. Someone said you can do futures trading to prevent being out of the markets but not all brokerage platforms allow that.",

I ended up losing about 2 % of my investments and counting in the process and it is not_even over yet . You have to liquidate your assets in your IRA in order to do a reverse rollover . For me this was investments like index funds and some stocks I had hand picked after finally starting investing this year at the age of 40 . I was worried about market volatility since I was going to be out of the market while the funds move from the IRA to 401k . I tried to do it now before December ’ s rate cut meeting approached so as to avoid having to sell low and buy high in case there was going to be a big rate cut rally . Sadly right after I sold a rumor of a December rate cut started spreading and the market has been rallying about 1 % a day . Had I just stayed put I would finally have seen some gains or added to gain in my investments after having done a late start to investments in my life . It is discouraging . PSA while you may not_be as unlucky as me be careful moving money in and out of accounts if it forces you to be out of the market even for a few days . This also happens when you switch employers sometimes . Someone said you can do futures trading to prevent being out of the markets but not_all brokerage platforms allow that ."

Assuming you have these investments covered is it worthwhile to throw your own savingsextra money into a Fidelity account Charles Schwab etc . and put even more into mutual funds stocks etc . or just focus on other investmentsholdings like RE cryptocurrency precious metals etc ."

The company's new AI application Qwen surpassed 10 million users in its first week of public beta and will gradually integrate e-commerce, navigation, and local services. Despite the positive revenue trends, operating margin compressed to 2% as Alibaba committed RMB 380 billion over three years to AI development.

      "title": "📓 The Fed Will End Quantitative Tightening on Monday",
      "selftext": "The Fed’s October rate cut was fully priced in, but the other important development from the last FOMC Meeting: **Quantitative Tightening will officially end on December 1**. After more than two years of shrinking its balance sheet, the Fed will stop draining liquidity and begin reinvesting maturing securities rather than letting them roll off. This matters because QT has been steadily removing cash from the financial system. Over time, bank reserves have slipped from “abundant” to merely “ample,” and stress signals have started appearing in overnight funding markets. The Fed essentially acknowledged that pushing QT any further risks destabilizing the plumbing of the financial system. Ending the runoff halts that tightening pressure immediately. The mechanics are straightforward. The Fed won’t restart Quantitative Easing *(printing money)*, but it will **stop shrinking its portfolio**. Instead of allowing bonds to disappear from the system, it will roll them into short-term Treasury bills. That stabilizes liquidity at current levels and removes the risk of additional drain. To use an analogy, **the Fed will not push the accelerator, but it's taking its foot off the brake**. Markets anticipated this pivot for months (**QT was slowed in March**), but formal confirmation is still a meaningful shift. It reduces the probability of an accidental liquidity crunch and acts as a quiet green light for risk assets even without outright easing. **Takeaway**: Ending QT doesn’t add liquidity, but it stops the bleeding. And in today’s environment, preserving liquidity is **bullish**.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Fed ’ s October rate cut was fully priced in but the other important development from the last FOMC Meeting Quantitative Tightening will officially end on December 1 . After more than two years of shrinking its balance sheet the Fed will stop draining liquidity and begin reinvesting maturing securities rather than letting them roll off . This matters because QT has been steadily removing cash from the financial system . Over time bank reserves have slipped from “ abundant ” to merely “ ample ” and stress signals have started appearing in overnight funding markets . The Fed essentially acknowledged that pushing QT any further risks destabilizing the plumbing of the financial system . Ending the runoff halts that tightening pressure immediately . The mechanics are straightforward . The Fed won ’ t restart Quantitative Easing printing money but it will stop shrinking its portfolio . Instead of allowing bonds to disappear from the system it will roll them into shortterm Treasury bills . That stabilizes liquidity at current levels and removes the risk of additional drain . To use an analogy the Fed will not_push the accelerator but its taking its foot off the brake . Markets anticipated this pivot for months QT was slowed in March but formal confirmation is still a meaningful shift . It reduces the probability of an accidental liquidity crunch and acts as a quiet green light for risk assets even without outright easing . Takeaway Ending QT doesn ’ t add liquidity but it stops the bleeding . And in today ’ s environment preserving liquidity is bullish ."
