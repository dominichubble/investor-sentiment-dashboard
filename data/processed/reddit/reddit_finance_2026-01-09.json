      "title": "Exclusive: Nvidia requires full upfront payment for H200 chips in China, sources say (Reuters)",
      "selftext": "Nvidia is requiring full upfront, non-refundable payment from Chinese customers for its H200 AI chips. Chinese regulators have temporarily asked some firms to pause H200 orders while deciding how many domestic chips must be purchased alongside each Nvidia chip. Chinese demand exceeds supply (orders >2M units vs. \\\\\\~700k available), despite domestic alternatives like Huawei’s Ascend which lag behind the H200 in performance. The policy shifts financial and regulatory risk from Nvidia to Chinese buyers, reflecting Nvidia’s caution after prior losses from sudden export bans. Nvidia is ramping production but capacity expansion is constrained by generational chip transitions and competition for foundry capacity. Nvidia’s payment terms effectively offload geopolitical and regulatory risk onto Chinese customers, protecting cash flow and avoiding inventory write downs. Beijing’s actions toward H200 imports signals a deliberate attempt to subsidize and force adoption of local products while still selectively accessing top tier Nvidia technology. Allowing H200s for commercial use while excluding military, SOEs, and critical infrastructure reflects a is Beijing’s way of balancing AI competitiveness with national security. Strong dependency on Nvidia persists despite heavy investment in domestic chips, Chinese tech giants’ willingness to prepay underscores continued reliance on Nvidia for cutting edge AI training. Rapid reversals in U.S. export controls and Chinese countermeasures suggest that capital discipline and flexible supply allocation are now core competitive advantages for Nvidia. Full prepayment, high unit prices, and excess demand indicate Nvidia retains exceptional pricing power, even in politically constrained markets which is something few hardware firms can sustain. Nvidia is monetizing Chinese demand while insulating itself from policy whiplash, and China is using regulatory approval to extract industrial policy concessions leaving buyers to absorb the uncertainty in exchange for access to best in class AI compute.",

When I plug our numbers into online calculators, it seems like we’re vaguely on track for my husband to retire eventually. However, I still worry it’s not enough for the following reasons: 1. ⁠I’m finding it very hard to estimate our annual expenses during retirement. We had kids younger and we didn’t have much money before we had kids. 2. ⁠The period of time when the kids will be in college is such a mystery to me. We will have kids, sometimes 2 at a time, in college for at least 8 years. Aside from the 529 accounts, I’m assuming we will have to cover significant expenses beyond tuition as well, so I wonder how that will affect our ability to save during those years. Do we have to save more aggressively now to account for this? 3. ⁠What if I might want 1 more kid???? Haha. 4. ⁠My in laws’ financial status is unknown. I have no idea what their retirement will look like and what kind of support they will need. How do I get a better idea of what we need and when we can take our foot off the gas? Or do people just keep saving as much as they can and hope it’s enough? It’s worth noting that investing $100k per year is not easy for us and we live pretty modestly compared to our friends. After saving for retirement and tithing 10% of our income to our local church, our monthly expenses have to be pretty tight. It would be nice to know when we can stop being so aggressive so we can enjoy life a little more.",

      "selftext": "Anybody looked at the preferred stock for Innovative Industrial Properties REIT (IIPR, preferred stock IIPR.PRA)? IIPR is a REIT that went public in 2016 and, in simple terms, targeted buying properties to the lease to marijuana companies. Marijuana companies - although a good chunk of states have legalized - are still federally illegal so IIPR was able to charge a premium, on the order of 3x normal rates for industrial type space. IIPR has always been profitable and never missed a dividend. Based on their most recent 10Q filing, they have $2.3 billion in assets - mainly the land and facilities they own - to about $340 million in debt. Recently, their income has gone down as - with marijuana prices decreasing as it becomes more of a commodity - they have had marijuana tenant defaults of about 16% of their revenue over the past year. But, even with that hit, their net income last quarter was still 1.75x their operating costs. Accordingly, from an equity perspective they have a buffer of about $1.8 billion; and, in general, even if all premiums for their rent went away - i.e., their revenues got cut in 1/3 - they would still be profitable. IIPR's common stock is trading down and has a 15% yield right now, which is priced like it will get cut. But, their preferred stock seems like a screaming deal. It has a 9.5% dividend yield - which is cumulative meaning they must pay dividends - and is trading at about 5% below par value. Additionally, the preferred stock value issued is only $44 million. With an approximately $1.8 billion equity cushion, it seems like the $44 million in preferred stock is extremely protected. And, to top it off you're getting a 9.5% yield and it seems like the only true risk is call risk as it can now get called at any time. But, even if it did get called, because it's currently trading 5% below call value, even then you would still get a return. **Summary**: IIPR preferred stock seems to have very little risk of going under. You get 9% yield and the only real risk is that it can get called at any time but, even then, you would still get a 5% immediate return on being called.",

      "title": "QXO: A boring roofing roll up company with potential for explosive growth",
      "selftext": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs, a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation. The company is executing a roll-up strategy in building products distribution, an extremely large, fragmented, and under-digitized industry. The investment case is less about short-term housing cycles and more about disciplined M&A, operational improvement, and long-term compounding. QXO operates in building materials distribution, with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products. It supplies contractors with products such as shingles, insulation, siding, waterproofing, and related materials. Key characteristics of the industry: * \\~$800B total addressable market * Highly fragmented, dominated by regional operators * Low digital penetration * Logistics-intensive and relationship-driven * Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital, systems, and operational discipline. The core of the thesis is management. Brad Jacobs has built multiple large-scale industrial platforms: * **United Waste:** sold for \\~$2.5B * **United Rentals (URI):** became the largest equipment rental company globally * **XPO Logistics:** \\~30x return, later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses, Jacobs followed a consistent playbook: 1. Enter fragmented industries 2. Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3. Standardize operations 4. Invest heavily in technology 5. Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500+ acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex, asset-heavy businesses. At QXO, he has invested roughly $900M of his own capital, alongside large institutional partners, creating strong alignment with shareholders. An important, often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected, long-duration capital. Jared Kushner, through his firm Affinity Partners, invested $150M in QXO and holds a board seat. While QXO is not a government contractor, these relationships matter in an industry influenced by: * Housing policy * Infrastructure investment * Disaster recovery funding * Insurance regulation * Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technology-enabled industrial operator. Technology is being deployed across: * Pricing and margin optimization * Demand forecasting and inventory planning * Route optimization and fleet utilization * Quoting and order management * Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses, QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries. Control allows standardization. Several structural tailwinds support the business: * \\~80% of roofing demand is non-discretionary * Aging U.S. housing stock * Increased frequency of storm and disaster-related repairs * Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement * Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housing-cycle narratives suggest. [Also, Apollo just invested $1+ billion - ]( you think you're smarter than Apollo? TLDR; Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because I'm an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely, so bought back in.",

      "selftext_processed": "QXO is a newly built public platform led by Brad Jacobs a proven industrial consolidator with a long history of value creation . The company is executing a rollup strategy in building products distribution an extremely large fragmented and underdigitized industry . The investment case is less about shortterm housing cycles and more about disciplined MA operational improvement and longterm compounding . QXO operates in building materials distribution with an initial focus on roofing and exterior products . It supplies contractors with products such as shingles insulation siding waterproofing and related materials . Key characteristics of the industry $ 800B total addressable market Highly fragmented dominated by regional operators Low digital penetration Logisticsintensive and relationshipdriven Many processes remain manual or outdated These dynamics favor a scaled consolidator with capital systems and operational discipline . The core of the thesis is management . Brad Jacobs has built multiple largescale industrial platforms United Waste sold for $ 2.5B United Rentals URI became the largest equipment rental company globally XPO Logistics 30x return later spun into GXO and RXO Across these businesses Jacobs followed a consistent playbook 1 . Enter fragmented industries 2 . Consolidate aggressively but with valuation discipline 3 . Standardize operations 4 . Invest heavily in technology 5 . Expand margins over time Jacobs has completed 500 acquisitions over his career and has repeatedly demonstrated an ability to integrate complex assetheavy businesses . At QXO he has invested roughly $ 900M of his own capital alongside large institutional partners creating strong alignment with shareholders . An important often overlooked aspect of QXO is its access to politically connected longduration capital . Jared Kushner through his firm Affinity Partners invested $ 150M in QXO and holds a board seat . While QXO is not_a government contractor these relationships matter in an industry influenced by Housing policy Infrastructure investment Disaster recovery funding Insurance regulation Mortgage and building code standards QXO is a technologyenabled industrial operator . Technology is being deployed across Pricing and margin optimization Demand forecasting and inventory planning Route optimization and fleet utilization Quoting and order management Warehouse automation and analytics By owning the operating businesses QXO avoids the adoption friction that plagues software vendors trying to sell into traditionally analog industries . Control allows standardization . Several structural tailwinds support the business 80 % of roofing demand is nondiscretionary Aging U.S. housing stock Increased frequency of storm and disasterrelated repairs Insurance and mortgage requirements that often mandate roof replacement Limited new housing supply supporting renovation and repair spending These factors make demand more resilient than typical housingcycle narratives suggest . Also Apollo just invested $ 1 billion you think youre smarter than Apollo TLDR Tailwinds in the housing market and political connections will propel QXO forward This is the current position I have open because Im an ape and sold my previous contract prematurely so bought back in ."

      "selftext": "Circle issues USDC on demand: users deposit USD, and Circle mints equivalent USDC, investing those reserves primarily in short-term US Treasuries and cash equivalents. Circle retains the interest income (after sharing portions with distribution partners like exchanges). The company benefits from a seigniorage-like mechanism in the digital realm-earning interest on reserves while scaling with demand for blockchain-based dollars. Few companies achieve 70%+ annual \"asset base\" growth with near-100% gross margins on the incremental revenue (interest minus minimal costs). Tech giants like Apple or Amazon grow revenue 10-20% in good years; Circle's core driver grew 73% in 2025. Low Risk: Reserves are safe (treasuries) Network Effects: Obvious.. Uniqueness: No other public company has this direct, leveraged exposure to money creation. Payment processors (visa) capture transaction fees; banks capture fractional deposits. Circle effectively monetizes the issuance and holding of private digital cash at scale With fiat money supply going to explode with ~~defence~~ war budget going up 50%, Trump's new Fed Chair coming soon with QE etc.- Circle shareholders might get rich.. 20B stock -for now.

It was unclear who Trump is referring to as his representatives. The White House and the Federal Housing Finance Agency did not immediately respond to CNBC’s requests for clarity.

      "selftext": "Hi all, My family has an antiquated tradition of gifting savings bonds to young relatives that I'd like to continue. I know that they're not a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there, but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool, one that stuck with me through the years. I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder, and I'm hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not a gift card. As the US Treasury Department no longer issues paper savings bonds, I'm exploring options from non-US countries. (I really do like the physical paper bond certificate, although it looks to be harder to find these days. Canada made a similar transition.) My base requirements in order (only the first one is absolutely required): \\-Legally purchasable by US citizen with no foreign residencies or dual citizenship \\-Minimum purchase amount $100 - $200 USD (open to going higher if needed, but I'd prefer smaller denominations) \\-Paper bonds issued if possible, electronic is fine but I'm sentimental. \\-Generally stable government in decent financial health, although my risk / reward tolerance is pretty high. Open to developing countries. Does anyone have any experience in this area? I recognize that this tradition is antiquated, but I think it's sweet and nostalgic. Thanks for taking a look.",

I know that theyre not_a good hedge against inflation and that there are better investments out there but I found savings bonds to be a good teaching tool one that stuck with me through the years . I also realize that finding a paper bond is becoming harder and Im hoping to purchase an actual bond certificate and not_a gift card . As the US Treasury Department no_longer issues paper savings bonds Im exploring options from nonUS countries . I really do like the physical paper bond certificate although it looks to be harder to find these days . Canada made a similar transition .

      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I’m 27 and want to start investing. I already have an emergency fund and I’m looking to invest for the long term, focusing more on safety and consistency than on short-term gains. I’m planning to start with around €15k and have been looking into ETFs like VTI, VOO, and SPLV. I’m not sure whether it makes sense to split the investment between different ETFs, or how to think about allocation in general. Should I focus mainly on broad market exposure, or does it make sense to set aside a small percentage for something a bit riskier with higher long-term growth potential? I’d really appreciate hearing different perspectives. Investing isn’t something my parents are familiar with (or particularly supportive of), so I’m trying to learn and make a sensible decision on my own. Thanks in advance for any advice or experiences you’re willing to share.",

After a very jagged advance to $160 by 2017, the stock was destroyed during the pandemic, falling all the way to 41 by early 2020. The shares recovered, reaching $218 by early 2022. EXPE was then smashed again, declining to $82 by late 2022. From its 2022 peak until February 2025, the stock traced out a large cup formation and then a handle. The shares broke out of this bullish pattern in August, peaking on September 15. What’s interesting: On November 7, EXPE gapped higher on huge volume, peaked a few days later, pulled back to its 10-week exponential, and then bounced again. PE is at 27 currently Currently net positive Latest insider buying (Expedia executive(s)rule 16b-3 , Scott f schenkel 12/15 30507 shares currently at a nav 4.67% gain .

I am 5-10 years from retirement and still interested in growth (not interested in moving to bonds etc). I need to move about 200K into other investments within my 401K, not all at once obviously. When I buy a stock or an ETF, I know the price at that moment. With a mutual fund I have no idea until the close and then it is too late to get that days price. I am not trying to time but it would annoy me to lose money based on trading today instead of tomorrow or the next day and it will add up. How can I guesstimate the price of a mutual fund at 2:30PM during the trading day (investment directives have to be in before 3PM).",

When I buy a stock or an ETF I know the price at that moment . With a mutual fund I have no_idea until the close and then it is too late to get that days price . I am not_trying to time but it would annoy me to lose money based on trading today instead of tomorrow or the next day and it will add up . How can I guesstimate the price of a mutual fund at 230PM during the trading day investment directives have to be in before 3PM ."

After the just first week of 2026 Target has rallied over 5% after dropping 31% in 2025, following the backlash surrounding its rollback of DEI initiatives. I’ve been a believer in Target for a while and have been consistently buying shares since October. But my faith in Target is mostly speculative, and I’m making to post to get some thoughts on more formal aspects of Target’s business. My continued faith in the company stems mainly from the fact that girls have always loved Target. Yes this did contribute to a decline in sales as their adherence to Trump’s anti-DEI policies drove away more progressive consumers, which in large part were young women who’ve been one of Target’s primary demographics. But from what I’ve observed, the backlash was more performative than anything, as even in early fall, a lot of girls I knew still saw Target as their preferred retailer (whether it’s for the store aesthetic or products I’m not sure). What did worry me though was Ulta beauty announcing that they were ending their long term partnership with Target, but from what I’ve observed even that doesn’t seem to be a big issue as girls still love stopping by Target and browsing their selection of beauty products.",

I’ve been putting in 400 SGD per month (slightly over 300 USD) and intends of setting a recurring buy every 2 weeks. Right now, this is my plan for the allocation: \\- VOO: 50%, 75 USD every 2 weeks \\- QQQM: 20%, 30 USD every 2 weeks \\- VXUS: 30%, 45 USD every 2 weeks Total: 150 USD every 2 weeks Few questions: 1) Does the allocation make sense? 2) If I intend to venture into healthcare, should I also leave a % of my portfolio for VHT? If so, how much? (I’ve been buying VHT when there’s a dip, but not sure if I should DCA on this as well) Would appreciate any advice from seniors. 🙏",

      "selftext": "Source - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the 2027 U.S. military budget should be $1.5 trillion, significantly higher than the $901 billion approved by Congress for 2026, boosting defense stocks, but sparking skepticism among budget experts. Any such increase in the military budget would require congressional authorization, which could pose a challenge, although Trump's Republicans, who hold slim majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives, have shown little appetite for objecting to Trump's spending plans. Trump said in a Truth Social post that he made the decision on 2027 military spending \"after long and difficult negotiations with Senators, Congressmen, Secretaries, and other Political Representatives... especially in these very troubled and dangerous times.\" In just the last few days, U.S. forces seized Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro from his country, toppling him from power. The White House has also said that Trump is discussing options for acquiring Greenland, including potential use of the U.S. military. Trump has also deployed U.S. troops to police a number of cities across the country. The news followed a separate Truth Social post from Trump blasting defense companies for producing weapons too slowly. In it he pledged to block defense contractors from paying dividends or buying back shares until they accelerated production. Trump said the extra spending would be covered by revenues generated by tariffs he has imposed on nearly every country and many industrial sectors, and the U.S. would still be able to reduce its debt and send dividend checks to \"moderate income\" Americans. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan think tank, estimated the proposal would cost $5 trillion through 2035, while adding $5.8 trillion to the U.S. debt with interest. It said only half the cost could be covered by tariffs in place now, noting that the Supreme Court could rule that a large set of tariffs were illegal. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates that combined tariffs raised $288 billion in 2025, well below Trump's own estimates, which have fluctuated around $600 billion in recent days.",

      "selftext": "I've recently studied a system used by seasoned traders that effectively transforms T+1 trading into near T+0 trading. Its logic is simple yet powerful: entering during the final 30 minutes of the trading day (the closing period) grants a “first-mover advantage” at the next day's opening. When quantitative funds boost liquidity in the early session, you avoid chasing rallies by instead providing exit liquidity (taking profits). This “six-step stock selection framework” targets mid-cap momentum stocks with specific characteristics: Golden Range: Up 3%-5% by 2:30 PM (indicating strong momentum without overextension). Strong Uptrend: Over 10% gain in the past 30 days. Size & Liquidity: Capped market cap for flexibility, volume ratio > 1. Volume Ratio Filter: Between 5% and 10% to confirm genuine buyer interest, not institutional dumping. Speed is determined by technique; mindset determines long-term success. I've been backtesting this approach and documenting specific signals. I've compiled a simplified pattern analysis and recent case studies. If you'd like to discuss these setups or understand the logic behind the filters, leave a comment and I'll respond.",

Its logic is simple yet powerful entering during the final 30 minutes of the trading day the closing period grants a “ firstmover advantage ” at the next days opening . When quantitative funds boost liquidity in the early session you avoid chasing rallies by instead providing exit liquidity taking profits . This “ sixstep stock selection framework ” targets midcap momentum stocks with specific characteristics Golden Range Up 3 % 5 % by 230 PM indicating strong momentum without overextension . Strong Uptrend Over 10 % gain in the past 30 days . Size Liquidity Capped market cap for flexibility volume ratio 1 . Volume Ratio Filter Between 5 % and 10 % to confirm genuine buyer interest not_institutional dumping . Speed is determined by technique mindset determines longterm success . Ive been backtesting this approach and documenting specific signals . Ive compiled a simplified pattern analysis and recent case studies . If youd like to discuss these setups or understand the logic behind the filters leave a comment and Ill respond ."

      "selftext": "People’s fear of tech ETFs today feels overblown. Many avoid them because of talk about an “AI bubble” or because tech makes up a big part of the S&P 500. They often compare it to the dot-com crash, but that’s not the same in my opinion and there is why: Back then, companies were small, investors had little information, and rules were weak. Today, tech giants are global, highly regulated, and have multiple revenue streams. Microsoft earns from Azure and Windows, Amazon from cloud and logistics and these are not U.S-only businesses, they operate worldwide. So why the fear? These companies are transparent and strong. If something big happens, tariffs or pandemics, it affects all sectors, not just tech. And now, every business uses technology. Microsoft today is nothing like [Pets.com]( in 2000. So why all of this fear on Tech ETFs? What else can be the leading theme next decades if every invention requires tech? War needs tech, Health needs tech.",

Some of the AI features will be turned on by default in inboxes, so users will have to opt out if they don’t want them. The company said Gmail will now be able to better summarize emails and suggest responses. Last year, Google’s Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages, draft emails from prompts, improve grammar and generate custom responses. One of the new features is “Suggested Replies,” which Google says uses the context of a user’s emails to create one-click responses. It’s an update to a prior tool called “Smart Replies.” The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise. Driven by its rapid advancements in AI, Google parent Alphabet topped Apple by market cap on Wednesday for the first time since 2019, continuing a rally that made the stock the best performer among tech megacaps last year. Meanwhile, OpenAI soared to a private market valuation of $500 billion late last year, and Anthropic said Wednesday that it’s valued at $350 billion in a new funding round.",

Last year Google ’ s Gemini integration in Gmail allowed users to do things like search messages draft emails from prompts improve grammar and generate custom responses . One of the new features is “ Suggested Replies ” which Google says uses the context of a user ’ s emails to create oneclick responses . It ’ s an update to a prior tool called “ Smart Replies. ” The company is also upgrading a proofreading option for checking grammar and making messages more concise .

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I'd like to get your opinions on my current PEA (French equity savings plan) allocation and my long-term investment strategy. For context: I'm 22 years old, still a student, and I invest with a very long-term perspective (15-20 years minimum). I invest exclusively through ETFs and I use dollar-cost averaging (DCA) on a monthly basis. Here is my current allocation in my French equity savings plan (PEA): * AMUNDI PEA MSCI World ETF (DCAM): **38%** * AMUNDI PEA MSCI Emerging Asia ESG ETF (PAASI): **14%** * BNP Paribas S&P 500 ETF (ESD): **30%** * BNP Paribas STOXX Europe 600 ETF (ETZ): **18%** So I only hold ETFs, no individual stocks at the moment. I would like your feedback on several points: * What do you think of this overall allocation? * Do you think any ETFs are over- or underweighted? * Would it be worthwhile to increase exposure to a particular region? * Do you see any missing assets or asset classes in this allocation? I'm considering adding a more sector-specific ETF, for example, one focused on armaments/defense, but I'm not sure if it's a good long-term strategy or if it would provide real diversification. Another point: Do you think it's better to remain 100% invested in ETFs, or to add some direct stock investments in the future? Finally, an important point: This post is intended for an international subreddit, and my French equity savings plan (PEA) limits me to European assets or eligible synthetic ETFs, such as the S&P 500 or the MSCI World that I currently hold. Thank you in advance for your feedback and constructive criticism.",

Novo already has the lead with its oral Wegovy and that has been a big part of why their stock has stayed so strong lately. Lilly clearly does not want to be left behind and is pushing hard into pill based options too. If Nimbus and Lilly manage to bring something effective to market, it could start shifting attention and money between these companies. Curious to see how this plays out for Novo long term since they have had such a big head start.",

Novo already has the lead with its oral Wegovy and that has been a big part of why their stock has stayed so strong lately . Lilly clearly does not_want to be left behind and is pushing hard into pill based options too . If Nimbus and Lilly manage to bring something effective to market it could start shifting attention and money between these companies . Curious to see how this plays out for Novo long term since they have had such a big head start ."

      "selftext": "Background: I’m 29 years old and currently have about $125k invested across TSP, Roth IRA, and a brokerage. About 20k in debt that I’m paying off (credit card with locked low rate due to SCRA)Very stable job making about 100k p/y My current approach is long-term investing with a heavy focus on growth, and I’m comfortable riding out market ups and downs. I’ve been looking at VOO vs VOOG and trying to think through the tradeoffs. I like the idea of focusing more on growth, but I also understand the benefit of just sticking with a broad S&P 500 fund and keeping expense ratios low. I guess what I’m really asking is: What are the pros/cons of investing in VOO vs VOOG when you have the time to ride the ups and downs? With VOOG being more tech-heavy, does the current AI money being concentrated in a handful of companies make it more unstable looking forward? Are there any big differences tax-wise between holding one vs the other in tax-advantaged accounts (Roth/TSP) vs a taxable brokerage? Does it make more sense to just pick one, or run some mix of the two? Curious what others think, especially anyone who’s held VOOG through different market cycles.",

Gemini has offered 1 year of free\\* subscription to Pro for Indian users. And it's one of the largest markets. So the rise in traffic could simply be because of that. So, it may not be because of Geminis superior tech or access to Search, Chrome, Android & Workspace. It's simply due to free subscriptions. In that case, there's a good chance that these numbers could drop once the free offering ends, given how price sensitive Indians are.",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, this is my next play: I am buying $30 calls expiring 1/30 for $SOFI. This play is a reversal/earnings play. SOFI has reached a bottom at the $26 range, and has since bounced to 26.98, where it closed. Here is my thesis: First off, SoFi is a digital financial services company that offers banking, loans, investing, and personal finance tools all in one app to help users manage, borrow, and grow their money. I am bullish for a few reasons: SOFI has demonstrated some very rapid growth over the past couple of quarters. For example, they added roughly 850k members, bringing the total membership to 11-12 million. SOFI is also diversifying its revenue stream by no longer being just a lender; it now earns meaningful revenue from financial services and technology platforms. SOFI is also adding alternative private-market funds and AI tools to their platform. Now on the financial side of things: SOFI’s revenue and GAAP profitability have been rapidly growing this year. Q1 revenue- $772M Q2 revenue- $855M Q3 revenue- $950M Q1 GAAP- $71M Q2 GAAP- $97M Q3 GAAP- $139.4M As you can see, both the revenue and GAAP are growing each year, which is bullish. Management has raised guidance, including forecasts for higher revenue, earnings, and adjusted EBITDA. Note: SOFI is down because they had a share offering, big names like Goldman Sachs, BOA, and Citigroup bought. Therefore, smart money is getting in right now. In conclusion, I am very bullish on this play as SOFI has demonstrated remarkable earnings lately and checks multiple boxes. SOFI has found a bottom and recently bounced off 26, showing that it has found support. SOFI has earnings coming up at the end of the month, so I believe that buying in now at essentially the bottom is perfect timing to ride these until the days leading up to the release of the earnings.",

      "selftext": "JPMorgan Chase has reached an agreement to take over the Apple Card program from Goldman Sachs, becoming the new issuer of Apple’s co-branded credit card which is one of the largest in the U.S. with roughly $20 billion in outstanding balances. Goldman is selling the card balances at a discount of more than $1 billion, reflecting challenges with credit performance such as delinquency and subprime exposure. JPM plans to launch a new Apple branded savings account. Customers with the Goldman backed Apple savings accounts can choose to stay or switch. Talks began in 2024, and the transition is expected to still take some time. This deal strengthens JPM’s already dominant credit card business while indicating Goldman’s retreat from mass consumer lending. AAPL originally launched the Apple Card with Goldman Sachs in 2019. Goldman’s broader consumer banking efforts incurred heavy losses, prompting it to scale back and seek a buyer for the Apple Card partnership.",

There’s a lot of fake news out there, and investors need to stay extra cautious, as there are plenty of traps in the market right now.

      "title": "Trump proposes massive increase in 2027 defense spending to $1.5 trillion to build 'Dream Military'",
      "selftext": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting military spending at $1.5 trillion in 2027, citing \"troubled and dangerous times.\" Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States. U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea. The 2026 military budget is set at $901 billion. Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested he's open to carrying out military operations in Colombia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba \"is in trouble.\" \"This will allow us to build the 'Dream Military' that we have long been entitled to and, more importantly, that will keep us SAFE and SECURE, regardless of foe,\" Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal. He added that he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office. Meanwhile, Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon, one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors, if the company did not end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity. Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry, yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eye-popping salaries to top executives. \"Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with Department of War,\" Trump said on social media. \"Also, if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government, under no circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks, where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars, until they are able to get their act together.\" [",

      "selftext_processed": "President Donald Trump on Wednesday proposed setting military spending at $ 1.5 trillion in 2027 citing troubled and dangerous times . Trump called for the massive surge in spending days after he ordered a U.S. military operation to capture Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro and spirit him out of the country to face drug trafficking charges in the United States . U.S. forces continue to mass in the Caribbean Sea . The 2026 military budget is set at $ 901 billion . Trump in recent days has also called for taking over the Danish territory of Greenland for national security reasons and has suggested hes open to carrying out military operations in Colombia . Secretary of State Marco Rubio has ominously warned that longtime adversary Cuba is in trouble . This will allow us to build the Dream Military that we have long been entitled to and more importantly that will keep us SAFE and SECURE regardless of foe Trump said in a posting on Truth Social announcing his proposal . He added that he feels comfortable surging spending on the military because of increased revenue created by his administration through tariffs imposed on friends and foes around the globe since his return to office . Meanwhile Trump on Wednesday also threatened to cut off Pentagon purchases from Raytheon one of the biggest U.S. defense contractors if the company did not_end the practice of stock buybacks and invest more profits into building out its weapons manufacturing capacity . Trump in recent months has repeatedly complained that defense companies have been woefully behind on deliveries of critical weaponry yet continue to mete out dividends and stock buybacks to investors and offering eyepopping salaries to top executives . Either Raytheon steps up and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment or they will no_longer be doing business with Department of War Trump said on social media . Also if Raytheon wants further business with the United States Government under no_circumstances will they be allowed to do any additional Stock Buybacks where they have spent Tens of Billions of Dollars until they are able to get their act together ."

      "title": "The Nigerian economy is fraudulent and I'm shorting the fucking Naira",
      "selftext": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not exist in the form claimed. The country's GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through: • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever \"discover\" growth, never decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals. When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy. The first Pillar: Energy Delusion You cannot run a $250-billion economy on Nigeria's electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services. The numbers don't compute, they're physically impossible. Here's some context: |A|**B**| |:-|:-| |Nigeria electricity per capita|**\\~140-180 kWh/year**| |Sub-Saharan Africa average|\\~400 kWh/year| |Brazil (for comparison)|\\~3,295 kWh/year| |Peak grid generation (March 2025)|**5,801 MW (celebrated as record)**| |Private generator capacity|\\~14,000 MW (half of all consumption)| Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated. Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers, they're effectively running factories on diesel generators. This is not an economy growing at 3% as claimed, it's an economy bleeding money to stay functional. Pillar 2: They're back to defending the Naira |**2025 FX Intervention**|**Amount**| |:-|:-| |CBN dollars sold to defend naira|**$7.53 billion**| |YoY reserve increase|$4.62 billion| |Net position|**-$2.91 billion (burning reserves)**| |Current reserves|\\~$45 billion| They're spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves. The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased, not earned. Inevitably these interventions will stop, either due to reserve depletion, election spending or an oil price shock (hello Venezuelan capacity!) Pillar 3: The biggest smoking gun: Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6% to \\~11% of GDP in the 2025 rebasing, a massive portion of this is 'imputed rent' - the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves. For context: Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for. Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP. This is done in a lot of countries. So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it? 1, They have no functional property registry to establish actual values. 2, 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3, Properties counted at \"market rent\" usually don't even have running water or electricity 4, The valuation method is impossible to audit, and is infalsifiable They're not measuring wealth that exists, they're measuring desperation, adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP. Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage. Pillar 4: The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing \"discovers\" sectors that conveniently offset dying ones. The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction: up. |**Rebasing Year**|**GDP \"Explosion\"**|**\"Discovered\" Sector**| |:-|:-|:-| |2014|**+89%**|Telecoms & Nollywood| |2025|**+35%**|Fintech & Real Estate| The have never once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better. Countries around the world, including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing. Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure. 2025 Sector Shift |**Sector**|**Old Share**|**New Share**| |:-|:-|:-| |Industry/Manufacturing|27.7%|21.1% ↓| |Services (ICT/Trade)|50.2%|55.5% ↑| |Real Estate|6.2%|10.8% ↑| Manufacturing collapses, gets relabeled to 'services', oil falls, gets offset by 'discovering' fintech. The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be. With this thesis and Nigeria's own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data, I think the Naira, worthless as it is, is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct. I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane, the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025. On power: \"The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head. Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that.\" On growth targets: \"If you are to get from $250 billion to $1 trillion in 5 years, it means the economy has to grow at 15%. But you are growing at 3%.\" On real estate: \"Real estate will not generate dollars for you. Oil and gas will generate dollars.\" On the trajectory: \"The economy is limping its way into recovery, not leaping.\" On living standards: \"The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago.\" This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media, telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs, the growth targets are fantasy, and living standards have declined over 15 years. He's an insider, not a shortseller. Edit: Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubu's term that he stole the last election from popular reformist, Peter Obi. He's confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before, an agrarian export-focused Nigeria with no currency protections. If he wins, the protections are gone, the Naira tumbles. If he wins, but Tinubu steals it from him again, markets send the naira tumbling anyway.",

      "selftext_processed": "The Nigerian naira is trading against an economy that does not_exist in the form claimed . The countrys GDP statistics are structurally manipulated through • Imputed rent calculations that turn housing crises into GDP growth • Sector reclassifications that hide industrial collapse • Rebasing exercises that only ever discover growth never_decline • Energy consumption figures mathematically incompatible with claimed output The Central Bank of Nigeria CBN is burning through foreign reserves to defend an exchange rate predicated on these fictional fundamentals . When intervention capacity inevitably depletes or when political priorities shift toward 2027 election spending the Naira will reprice violently to reflect the actual economy . The first Pillar Energy Delusion You can not run a $ 250billion economy on Nigerias electricity output while claiming a transition to digitized services . The numbers dont compute theyre physically impossible . Heres some context AB Nigeria electricity per capita140180 kWhyear SubSaharan Africa average400 kWhyear Brazil for comparison3295 kWhyear Peak grid generation March 20255801 MW celebrated as record Private generator capacity14000 MW half of all consumption Even the claimed figures are likely exaggerated . Energy costs account for nearly half of production expenses for nigerian manufacturers theyre effectively running factories on diesel generators . This is not_an economy growing at 3 % as claimed its an economy bleeding money to stay functional . Pillar 2 Theyre back to defending the Naira 2025 FX InterventionAmount CBN dollars sold to defend naira $ 7.53 billion YoY reserve increase $ 4.62 billion Net position $ 2.91 billion burning reserves Current reserves $ 45 billion Theyre spending more on defending their currency than they are on building reserves . The naira appreciation after the corrective crash was purchased not_earned . Inevitably these interventions will stop either due to reserve depletion election spending or an oil price shock hello Venezuelan capacity Pillar 3 The biggest smoking gun Imputed Rent Scam Real Estate jumped from 6 % to 11 % of GDP in the 2025 rebasing a massive portion of this is imputed rent the made up value of homeowners theoretically renting their homes to themselves . For context Economists ask themselves how much a homeowner would rent their home to themselves for . Then they add this imaginary transaction to GDP . This is done in a lot of countries . So why is it fraudulent when Nigeria does it 1 They have no_functional property registry to establish actual values . 2 28 million unit housing deficit creates artificial scarcity in pricing 3 Properties counted at market rent usually dont even have running water or electricity 4 The valuation method is impossible to audit and is infalsifiable Theyre not_measuring wealth that exists theyre measuring desperation adding a hint of fantasy on top and baking that into GDP . Rent is artificially high simply because of the 28 million housing unit shortage . Pillar 4 The Sector Shell Game Every Nigerian GDP rebasing discovers sectors that conveniently offset dying ones . The pattern is consistent and always moves in one direction up . Rebasing YearGDP ExplosionDiscovered Sector 201489 % Telecoms Nollywood 202535 % Fintech Real Estate The have never_once rebased their GDP and found their economy was smaller or even marginally better . Countries around the world including other developing nations like South Africa and developed like the US routinely find overestimates during rebasing . Nigeria stands out because they always find buried treasure . 2025 Sector Shift SectorOld ShareNew Share IndustryManufacturing27.7 % 21.1 % ↓ Services ICTTrade50.2 % 55.5 % ↑ Real Estate6.2 % 10.8 % ↑ Manufacturing collapses gets relabeled to services oil falls gets offset by discovering fintech . The sectors shift to wherever growth needs to be . With this thesis and Nigerias own insiders pointing to inconsistencies in the data I think the Naira worthless as it is is still wildly overvalued and has tons of room to correct . I leave you with some quotes from Bismarck Rewane the CEO o f Financial Derivatives Co. dated August 2025 . On power The power generated per head in Nigeria is 180 kilowatt per head . Maybe you can light one or two bulbs with that . On growth targets If you are to get from $ 250 billion to $ 1 trillion in 5 years it means the economy has to grow at 15 % . But you are growing at 3 % . On real estate Real estate will not_generate dollars for you . Oil and gas will generate dollars . On the trajectory The economy is limping its way into recovery not_leaping . On living standards The standard of living of Nigerians today is much worse than it was maybe 15 years ago . This is a senior Nigerian economist who advises institutions and is regularly quoted in financial media telling you on live television that the power output can barely light bulbs the growth targets are fantasy and living standards have declined over 15 years . Hes an insider not_a shortseller . Edit Adding the exit strategy Nigerians have insisted throughout Bola Tinubus term that he stole the last election from popular reformist Peter Obi . Hes confirmed he will be contesting in 2027 and will run on the same platform as before an agrarian exportfocused Nigeria with no_currency protections . If he wins the protections are gone the Naira tumbles . If he wins but Tinubu steals it from him again markets send the naira tumbling anyway ."

The positional inversion in market cap underscores the different directions that Alphabet and Apple are heading in when it comes to their respective strategies for artificial intelligence. Alphabet ended 2025 as one of the top performers on Wall Street after putting together the pieces for its AI comeback. In November, the company unveiled Ironwood, the seventh generation of its tensor processing units, a custom AI chip that has emerged as a potential alternative to Nvidia’s offerings. Then in December, Google introduced Gemini 3 to rave reviews. Shares of Alphabet jumped 65% in 2025, the company’s sharpest rally since 2009, when the stock doubled coming out of the financial crisis. CEO Sundar Pichai has repeatedly said the company is responding to soaring demand. On Alphabet’s October earnings call, he said that Google’s cloud business signed more deals over $1 billion in 2025 through the third quarter of the year than in the two prior years combined. Meanwhile, Apple has remained largely absent from the tech industry’s AI race that kicked off when OpenAI launched ChatGPT in late 2022. Apple was supposed to launch the next generation of its Siri AI assistant last year, but the company wound up delaying that release. Apple has promised to launch the “more personal Siri” in 2026.",

What I did all last year was keep that 35k as cash, Sell a put or spread, immediately buy SGOV with the premium received, sell SGOV when I need to BTC, profit goes to my core long term hold tickers. I did really well, 45% return in 2025. This year I took that 35k and bought SGOV, increased margin and now my SGOV is my collateral. I only open trades to a max of 35k collateral so I have the funds to cover max loss on everything in SGOV. This seems like I'm borrowing but my cash balance is positive so I don't think I'll be charged interest and I'll actually make a little over $100 a month from SGOV which I was missing out on before. Am I missing something something here? I understand the inherent risks of my strategy but I'm only asking about the use of margin. Setting my borrowing limit to like 100k is scary but I don't think there is any way to actually borrow that much in my current system.",

      "selftext": "Everyone is freaking out because the new Vera Rubin racks are 100% liquid cooled without the need for a mechanical chiller. But, MOD sells dry chillers! In fact, they are probably similar positioned as Vertiv because they sell a range of products that will benefit from the new Vera Rubin server racks. By the way, when a hyperscaler deploys the new Vera Rubin rack, they won't replace all of the chips inside of the building. Probably they will replace the racks section by section as they get inventory. A data center in 2028 will likely have a ton of different chips inside, **most** needing traditional chillers. By the way, people always forget that data centers need redundant cooling products in their buildings due to REGULATION. This is due to ambient heat created from the server racks. Making the products that Vertiv and Modine sell ESSENTIAL to all data centers through the unforeseeable future. If data centers are being deployed, they are getting there products from Vertiv, Mod, TT, etc. Since Monday, the stock is down roughly 14% due to nothing besides this Vera Rubin rack nonsense. Buy back in, we're going to $200 once people realize this. I believe their order backlog will continue to increase because of the reasons above.",

But MOD sells dry chillers In fact they are probably similar positioned as Vertiv because they sell a range of products that will benefit from the new Vera Rubin server racks . By the way when a hyperscaler deploys the new Vera Rubin rack they wont replace all of the chips inside of the building . Probably they will replace the racks section by section as they get inventory . A data center in 2028 will likely have a ton of different chips inside most needing traditional chillers . By the way people always forget that data centers need redundant cooling products in their buildings due to REGULATION . This is due to ambient heat created from the server racks . Making the products that Vertiv and Modine sell ESSENTIAL to all data centers through the unforeseeable future . If data centers are being deployed they are getting there products from Vertiv Mod TT etc . Since Monday the stock is down roughly 14 % due to nothing_besides this Vera Rubin rack nonsense . Buy back in were going to $ 200 once people realize this . I believe their order backlog will continue to increase because of the reasons above ."

The site becomes Joby’s second facility in Ohio and its third overall, significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint alongside its 435,500 sq ft Marina, California plant. Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027, with longer-term capacity projected at up to \\~500 aircraft annually. For investors, this move highlights Joby’s transition from R&D toward capital-intensive manufacturing, with execution, certification timing, and demand visibility now becoming the key variables to watch.

The site becomes Joby ’ s second facility in Ohio and its third overall significantly expanding its U.S. manufacturing footprint alongside its 435500 sq ft Marina California plant . Management says the Ohio operations are intended to support production scaling to roughly four eVTOL aircraft per month by 2027 with longerterm capacity projected at up to 500 aircraft annually . For investors this move highlights Joby ’ s transition from RD toward capitalintensive manufacturing with execution certification timing and demand visibility now becoming the key variables to watch ."

      "selftext": "Single family home REITS dropped by 5-10% across the board today after Trump made a comment about how institutional investors such as private equity shouldn't be allowed to buy existing Single family homes. INVH, in particular, is down 9%. Here's why this drop is an opportunity: 1. This hypothetical law, which Trump will need to convince congress to pass, would not even apply to Invitation homes, because they do not buy existing homes, they build new ones to rent out. But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9%. 2. If anything, this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage; competitors such as private equity firms can no longer buy existing homes to rent out. This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent, pushing rents up on their existing homes. On top of this, INVH can continue to build new homes to rent, at better margins now that rents are higher. 3. INVH is trading at an estimated 30-40% discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts. So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multi-year period, shareholders come out ahead. 4. If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes, they won't be able to buy them directly anymore. As a result, there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties. This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH.",

INVH in particular is down 9 % . Heres why this drop is an opportunity 1 . This hypothetical law which Trump will need to convince congress to pass would not_even apply to Invitation homes because they do not_buy existing homes they build new ones to rent out . But they got caught in the sell off and are down 9 % . 2 . If anything this law puts Invitation homes at an advantage competitors such as private equity firms can no_longer buy existing homes to rent out . This limits the supply of single family homes available for rent pushing rents up on their existing homes . On top of this INVH can continue to build new homes to rent at better margins now that rents are higher . 3 . INVH is trading at an estimated 3040 % discount to the underlying value of its homes minus debts . So even in the extreme case where INVH is required to divest its holdings over a multiyear period shareholders come out ahead . 4 . If Institutional investors want exposure to single family homes they wont be able to buy them directly anymore . As a result there would be increased demand for existing REITs that already own properties . This would act as a technical factor favoring INVH ."

      "selftext": "A company specializing in automotive supply chains made a strategic decision several years ago to heavily support American electric vehicles (primarily Ford and GM). However, both automakers subsequently cut their pure electric projects. In early 2025, this supply chain company initiated major layoffs. Fortunately, its non EV projects remain quite robust. Their primary semiconductor supplier is MU. In the latter half of the year, MU indicated price reductions for 2026, leading the company to be highly optimistic about profitability that year. However, in December, MU announced significant price hikes for all products except one minor adjustment! (MU's stock price has surged 47% since December). This company was swamped before Christmas in December, scrambling to revise budgets. The COO, who had previously assured the board of cost reductions for 2026, now had to explain costs surging 1.5 times. They also had to justify raising prices immediately after setting them with downstream clients like GM and Ford. The COO was stressed to the max. The only silver lining? Their employees immediately bought MU stock. New vehicles will definitely see price hikes in 2026, and the used car market is once again being driven by CVNA.",

However both automakers subsequently cut their pure electric projects . In early 2025 this supply chain company initiated major layoffs . Fortunately its non EV projects remain quite robust . Their primary semiconductor supplier is MU . In the latter half of the year MU indicated price reductions for 2026 leading the company to be highly optimistic about profitability that year . However in December MU announced significant price hikes for all products except one minor adjustment MUs stock price has surged 47 % since December . This company was swamped before Christmas in December scrambling to revise budgets . The COO who had previously assured the board of cost reductions for 2026 now had to explain costs surging 1.5 times . They also had to justify raising prices immediately after setting them with downstream clients like GM and Ford . The COO was stressed to the max . The only silver lining Their employees immediately bought MU stock . New vehicles will definitely see price hikes in 2026 and the used car market is once again being driven by CVNA ."

      "selftext": "When I first started investing, I spent a lot of time overanalyzing small decisions. Every allocation tweak felt important, every market move needed an explanation. Over time, especially after living through a few volatile periods, I noticed that the biggest improvement didn’t come from better analysis, but from doing less. Simplifying the process, checking prices less often, and accepting that uncertainty is part of the game made investing feel calmer and more sustainable. I’m curious what helped others reach that point. Was it experience, a bad mistake, automation, or simply time in the market?",

      "title": "Capitulation Bottoms: How to Spot Explosive Reversals Before They Happen",
      "selftext": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal. These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand, creating a high-probability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early. A typical capitulation involves a rapid, steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out. This is usually confirmed by a volume spike, showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once. Price structure plays a critical role. Key levels like major support zones, trendline holds, or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in. Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal. Risk management is essential tight stop-loss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside. For early entries, it’s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce, bullish candlestick formation, or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in. Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto. For example, when a stock drops 15% in two days, hits a historical support level, and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that’s a strong case for a reversal trade. Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves.",

      "selftext_processed": "Capitulation bottoms often signal the end of a sharp decline and the beginning of a powerful reversal . These setups are driven by extreme selling pressure followed by sudden demand creating a highprobability opportunity for traders who can read the signs early . A typical capitulation involves a rapid steep drop in price often fueled by panic selling where weak hands are flushed out . This is usually confirmed by a volume spike showing that a large number of positions are being liquidated all at once . Price structure plays a critical role . Key levels like major support zones trendline holds or previous lows act as strong areas where buyers step in . Spotting a reaction at these levels can be the first sign of reversal . Risk management is essential tight stoploss placement just below recent lows helps protect against further downside . For early entries it ’ s wise to wait for a confirmation signal such as a strong bounce bullish candlestick formation or a reclaim of a key level before scaling in . Capitulation bottoms have a track record of marking major turning points in both stocks and crypto . For example when a stock drops 15 % in two days hits a historical support level and rebounds on heavy volume the next session that ’ s a strong case for a reversal trade . Reading these patterns right can position traders ahead of explosive moves ."

      "title": "GLP-1R Agonist due diligence (Novo Nordisk stock analysis)",
      "selftext": "Tried to post this on value investing but got removed, possiblity due to multiple previous posts about Novo Nordisk. Wanted to post my analysis for critique: For context I have previously just held index funds (S&P 500 & FTSE 100) but with growing fears (believable IMO) of an AI/ Tech bubble and the fact that the S&P 500 is currently 34.43% weighted to Tech I wanted to look at diversifying away from that with some defensive stock picks. My professional background is healthcare so seems a reasonable place to start. Firstly I would say the safe bet is that GLP-1 agonists and similar drugs are going to be a mainstay of pharamacetutical sales over the next 10 years and probably further into the future. They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss & obesity which is a plague of the western word. Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints (morbidity and mortality) like diabetes and heart disease etc. On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile (notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening). I'm not sure if many would disagree with this first point. Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP-1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline. Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche, Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera. The horizon includes the oral version of Novo's existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly; Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novo's large molecule oral semaglutide. Lilly also has a triple agonist (retatrutide) which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing. Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II. So as alot of people have alluded to Novo's share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug (Tirzepatide / Mounjaro). I don't have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP-1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below. I have avoided using any forward looking metrics (like PEG or projected EPS) because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know? I've just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals. |**Stock**|**Roche**|**Amgen**|**Pfizer**|**Eli Lilly**|**Novo Nordisk**| |:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-| |**Price in USD**|$422.11|$340.55|$25.66|$1,107.89|$57.11| |**Current Price before conversion**|336.40|340.55|$25.66|1,107.89|365.25| |**Market Cap ($)**|342.2B|184.4B|146.5B|1055.0B|253.6B| |**P/E**|28.68|26.37|14.91|54.04|15.6| |**EPS**|11.75|12.94|1.72|20.45|23.33| |**EV/EBITDA**|13.02|13.53|7.83|34.29|10.10| |**Debt / Equity**|1.05|5.67|0.67|1.79|0.60| |**ROIC**|18.54%|10.56%|7.04%|29.95%|42.81%| Not only does Novo have a much better P/E ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share, better value to earnings ratio, better debt to equity ratio. Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years. Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns. So this just means the business is well run and has good financials. But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs? That is definetely a possibility, especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron, but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer. So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly, and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term. Essentially it doesn't need to be see as a 'winner takes all situation' with such a large market. The problem with Lilly is the current price. Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04. It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise. And yes there are other risks for Novo, the standard pharma risks of drugs not working as intended, or intolerable side effects, but this isn't a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised. On the plus side Novo does have other (smaller) facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP-1 Market. I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies (including Lilly and maybe Roche) but weight it towards Novo. I'm not posting this all so you can agree with me, I'm hoping for (hopefully) insightful critiques. What am I not considering?",

They have shown themselves already to be a silver bullet for weight loss obesity which is a plague of the western word . Furthermore there is good evidence to suggest they are powerful at reducing obesity related diseases with hard endpoints morbidity and mortality like diabetes and heart disease etc . On top of this they do this with what seems to be an acceptably rare side effect profile notably there are cases of severe pancreatitis which is life threatening . Im not_sure if many would disagree with this first point . Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly as you probably know are the only two companies to have GLP1 Receptor agonists on the market and both have other drugs in pipeline . Other key companies with drugs in pipeline include Roche Amgen and Pfizer which aquired one with Metsera . The horizon includes the oral version of Novos existing drug semaglutide which just got FDA approval and a new small molecule drug from Lilly Orforglipron which should be noted for the fact that it will probably be cheaper to produce than Novos large molecule oral semaglutide . Lilly also has a triple agonist retatrutide which hits two other key receptors with a differing affinity profile which seemed to be quite effective based on their dose escalation phase II trials with phase III trials ongoing . Novo has a dual and a triple agonist also in the pipeline at Phase II . So as alot of people have alluded to Novos share price has plummeted from an all time high in the last year with the accepted narrative being that Lilly has eaten its lunch by being able to rapidly take market share through faster manufacturing with what seems to be a slighlty more effective drug Tirzepatide Mounjaro . I dont have a background in finance or stock analysis but I have tried to compare these GLP1Ra related companies using key value investing ratios for the last financial year below . I have avoided using any forward looking metrics like PEG or projected EPS because in my inexperieced view that is just relying on someone elses prediction about what will happen and why would they know Ive just focused on whether the business is well run and has good fundamentals . StockRocheAmgenPfizerEli LillyNovo Nordisk Price in USD $ 422.11 $ 340.55 $ 25.66 $ 1107.89 $ 57.11 Current Price before conversion336.40340.55 $ 25.661107.89365.25 Market Cap $ 342.2B184.4B146.5B1055.0B253.6B PE28.6826.3714.9154.0415.6 EPS11.7512.941.7220.4523.33 EVEBITDA13.0213.537.8334.2910.10 Debt Equity1.055.670.671.790.60 ROIC18.54 % 10.56 % 7.04 % 29.95 % 42.81 % Not_only does Novo have a much better PE ratio compared to competitors it also has higher earnings per share better value to earnings ratio better debt to equity ratio . Finally the return on invested capital is significantly higher and has been high for years . Essentially this business is highly efficient at turning invested capital into returns . So this just means the business is well run and has good financials . But surely theres a risk that Eli Lilly will just dominate the market with better drugs That is definetely a possibility especially with the potentially cheaper Orforglipron but I would argue the obesity market is so large and is likely to get even larger as developing countries become richer . So much so that there will be a large enough market for Novo to still sell plenty of their drugs even if they are number 2 behind Lilly and hopefully derive growth and value over the long term . Essentially it doesnt need to be see as a winner takes all situation with such a large market . The problem with Lilly is the current price . Just compare those same metrics with a whopping PE of 54.04 . It otherwise seems like a reasonably well run company with good prospects pipeline wise . And yes there are other risks for Novo the standard pharma risks of drugs not_working as intended or intolerable side effects but this isnt a new class of drugs so hopefully those risks are minimised . On the plus side Novo does have other smaller facets to its business including insulin and rare disease medicines so this does slightly reduce the downside risk if they gut hammered in the GLP1 Market . I will probably end up buying a bundle of 3 of these companies including Lilly and maybe Roche but weight it towards Novo . Im not_posting this all so you can agree with me Im hoping for hopefully insightful critiques . What am I not_considering"

JP Morgan backs governments major institutions and other banks it literally can not afford to ever really disappear it is backed by states JP consistently posts strong growth figures Good stuff aside it fell more than the SP during 2008 Crisis and Covid but also recovered better The real key point is the second one . Is JP Morgan the perfect ideal investment as well as an investment in Gold as in boom it does super well consistently and is well supported in bust use the increase in Gold price to buy more of the JP lmao"

      "selftext": "Oklo announced today that it has signed a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to support the design, construction, and operation of a radioisotope pilot plant (“Radioisotope Pilot Facility”) under the DOE Reactor Pilot Program (RPP). Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization. “This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction. By building and operating a pilot reactor, we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments, improve regulatory efficiency, and deliver long-term value,” said Jacob DeWitte, co-founder and CEO of Oklo. Atomic Alchemy Inc., an Oklo subsidiary, is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States. These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer, treating disease, powering medical research, and supporting national security. Today, many are produced overseas or in aging facilities. By first operating a pilot plant, Oklo can then scale into reliable, domestic production that helps ensure hospitals, researchers, and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials. With the OTA now in place, Atomic Alchemy will focus its near-term resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization. As part of this learn-first-then-scale strategy, Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner-1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility. Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security, healthcare infrastructure, and industrial leadership.",

Signing the OTA is a major milestone which marks the transition from project selection and planning into active execution under DOE authorization . “ This OTA establishes a framework for execution and risk reduction . By building and operating a pilot reactor we generate the data and experience to streamline future commercial deployments improve regulatory efficiency and deliver longterm value ” said Jacob DeWitte cofounder and CEO of Oklo . Atomic Alchemy Inc. an Oklo subsidiary is using the Radioisotope Pilot Facility to lay the groundwork for future commercial plants that make medical and research radioisotopes in the United States . These radioisotopes are essential for diagnosing cancer treating disease powering medical research and supporting national security . Today many are produced overseas or in aging facilities . By first operating a pilot plant Oklo can then scale into reliable domestic production that helps ensure hospitals researchers and patients have consistent access to these lifesaving materials . With the OTA now in place Atomic Alchemy will focus its nearterm resources on building the Radioisotope Pilot Facility under DOE authorization . As part of this learnfirstthenscale strategy Atomic Alchemy has withdrawn its previously submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission construction permit application for the Meitner1 commercial radioisotope production facility at Idaho National Laboratory to focus on the Radioisotope Pilot Facility . Oklo views the RPP as an enabler and accelerator to deliver advanced nuclear technologies that strengthen U.S. energy security healthcare infrastructure and industrial leadership ."

I know we can’t predict the market, so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy. To start, I max out my Roth every year and am 80% invested in QQQ/SPY. I will continue to do that, and I will keep everything there. It’s currently about 30% of total my stock assets. I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio. Mostly tech. I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130% all time. So, I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in. (to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash) Selling out of: FANNG, and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG, TSM, CRWD, etc. (selling about 2/3 of all active portfolio) Keeping: MSFT, MELI, NNOX, PL, SOFI, COST, JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a) they’re my babies and have strong conviction b) moonshot potential c) confidence during recession. Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield, secure ETF/alternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy. Sound reasonable? I’d love feedback",

I know we can ’ t predict the market so I think I want to adjust my investing strategy . To start I max out my Roth every year and am 80 % invested in QQQSPY . I will continue to do that and I will keep everything there . It ’ s currently about 30 % of total my stock assets . I have about 25 stocks in my active portfolio . Mostly tech . I started investing in 2019 and am currently up 130 % all time . So I want to narrow it down to a selection of stocks that I have the strongest conviction in . to lock in profits and use for a potential down payment on a house if there is a crash Selling out of FANNG and most blue chip tech stocks like ISRG TSM CRWD etc . selling about 23 of all active portfolio Keeping MSFT MELI NNOX PL SOFI COST JMIA I want to keep those ones because either a they ’ re my babies and have strong conviction b moonshot potential c confidence during recession . Then I want to take the proceeds and invest in a high yield secure ETFalternative income asset like HYG until I find a house to buy . Sound reasonable I ’ d love feedback"

Buffett, who retired last year, famously took an annual salary of $100,000 with no bonus or stock awards for over 40 years. Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $150 billion, the tenth-richest person in the world. Abel, who was previously Buffett's deputy, was paid $21 million last year. CEOs of S&P 500 companies were paid an average of $18.9 million in 2024. I believe he will maintain the company's investment philosophy even though he is known for having a more hands-on leadership style than Buffett.",

Buffett who retired last year famously took an annual salary of $ 100000 with no_bonus or stock awards for over 40 years . Bloomberg estimates his net worth at $ 150 billion the tenthrichest person in the world . Abel who was previously Buffetts deputy was paid $ 21 million last year . CEOs of SP 500 companies were paid an average of $ 18.9 million in 2024 . I believe he will maintain the companys investment philosophy even though he is known for having a more handson leadership style than Buffett ."

      "title": "hedging the impending AI doom bubble",
      "selftext": "I am not here to debate the bubbliness of it all, or the merits or demerits of AI and all that, or the timeline on which it will collapse. my original bet (made in late 2023) was buying NVDIA, Snap, and Palantir puts that will expire worthless in two weeks unless I spend more to roll them. which I will not, so this is obviously not financial advice, as I am not qualified to give it. and my timing sucked. io am however, hedging in other ways. I just want to share thoughts on how I am hedging for what I think is going to be an AI bubble burst. again, this is not financial advice, I am a monkey randomly hitting buttons here, and will soon resort to avian augury to divine my path through the market. anyways. generally, I think tech and anything AI especially are in a bubble right now. their market value keeps going up, and their use generally is staying the same, if not optically decreasing- to that last point, more are more people are starting to see what is and what is not vaporware in the ai space now, and understand the limitations and value proposition of ai than they did a few years ago when this all started. AI has uses, but when I say AI in terms of the bubble and industry, I am talking about generative AI. I think that AI is one of the tools of the future, just not the pure generative kind. machine learning, and other forms of AI that we have been developing for a long time are, I think, where the long term bet is at vis a vis AI as a stable market force rather than AI the generative AI industry. to that end, I do have positions in TSMC, as I believe that regardless of where the tech industry goes, they, other fabs, and the people who supply them will be the ultimate winners of this bubble, and they who will lose the least when the dust settles. Venezuela does put a slight damper in my \"the US wouldn't be that impatient, and china is way too patient, right?\" mantra about Taiwan and TSMC, but I'm convinced Venezuela is an oil play, and the orange man hates anything to do with computers or people who he can't bully. politics aside, I think that companies like NVDIA and AMD will still be businesses after the dust settles, as long as NVDIA isn't doing an ENRON, but I just dont see their moat as impenetrable. and even if it is, is it protecting as big a hoard as they thing? we saw with deepseek that there are efficiency improvements to be found, which could seriously cut into NVDIA's bottom line. it is only a matter of time until the market has to reckon with the fact that generative AI just does not do what we want it to do. it is not worth trillions of dollars at the moment in terms of return on investment. days, months, years, I'm not sure, but here are the things I think that are actually making the world a different, better place, and will change the world. basically, good things to invest in, for better, or for worse, that are not AI. Geospatial tech. I think things like LIDAR, improved GIS networks, long range networks and network access are going to become huge. they already are, but they represent incredible breakthroughs in how we understand the world, and how we interact with it. also huge for how companies provide services BIOMED- Crispr and mRNA (and similar) vaccines and therapies, and the combination therein. right now the main thing holding these incredible technologies back from being something super commonplace in medicine is 1. no real regulation on using it on embryos and fetuses, or about engineering embryos (there is a ban, but at some point, we will have to address the reality of the probability of use while trying to figure out what is medicine and what is eugenics- quite the sticky wicket, wouldn't you say, since it could both very rapidly add to or detract from human genetic diversity in ways that are impossible to predict, except that they have the potential to alter the evolutionary course of Homo sapiens and everything else on this planet) 2. the process of using it now, though effective, is brutal, and limited I think that the recent sickle cell cure requires someone with sickle cell anemia to undergo bone marrow removal, chemo and radiation, and then the marrow is replaced? I dont know, but it sounds like something not everyone will be able to undergo yet, unfortunately. 3. its so expensive. so so so expensive. millions of dollars for individualized treatment expensive. insurance may or may not cover it expensive. 4. the political climate in many of the wealthiest developed nations vis a vis vaccines and biomedical breakthroughs is not favorable. it is setting us back years or decades from cures. chips and batteries- I dont know about large scale 50000k a pop chips but more and more computer chips are going in more and more things. I mean lego just chipped the brick. so my guess is more chips, and eventually, AI integration into things that people actually want to/like to use en masse. that means more battery life being used by the average device. even with battery breakthroughs, it will be decades before the lithium battery in some form is replaced just because the infrastructure is so large, and the demand is so rapidly growing. who knows whether we will all be using iPhones, androids, or whatever the next trend in phone or computer or electronic is, but it will likely use batteries, and it will likely use chips. If NVIDIA goes the way of Enron, I think tsmc will still have a waitlist. hemp and marijuana- I have both optimistic and cynical reasons for these picks. plenty of etfs around for cheap that have invested in OTC or private enterprises that are harder to invest in but profitable if things become legal and/or more widely adopted in the western world. I think marijuana legalization would be a very bread and circuses move for a certain western leader or two, and I think hemp has real potential in a resurgence for use in building materials and fiber applications, among other things. I think that it is inevitable, given the economics of hemp (even big corporations at some point will have to admit using a weed for a lot of things is cheap, someone will figure out the gummed up machinery thing soon I imagine (interchangeable milling and harvesting heads? but I digress) and I am very slowly investing with the hope that inevitability comes relatively soon. that is more of a Hail Mary, and totally at the mercy of political winds. china- I'm not here to debate china's ascendence to the world stage as one of the top superpowers. its been around a long time, it will be around a long time, and I kinda believe that. I think that they are a stability hedge with growth potential. not to be stereotypical, but china is ahead of the western world in almost every metric that seems important to a healthy future as a nation besides their political system (which is honestly the most democratic its maybe ever been in its long history, though this is mostly concerning problems of allegations of forced labor and some real systemic xenophobia?as an American, I shall not throw stones at glass houses) and I believe that their economy is set up for success, in that I believe that economies in a capitalistic world economy are only as successful as both the gross amount of resource that they exploit, and the rate at which they exploit it. china has an incredible amount of natural and human resource to exploit, and are rapidly increasing their capacity to exploit it in the long term via education and research, renewable energy initiatives, and policies meant to support the environment. I make no ethical judgement there, some is good, some is bad, again as an American, can't speak to that one (we have national parks. we also created the conditions for them to burn to ashes uncontrollably, with the best of intentions). anyways, I think china's industry and economy in general is something I want to invest in, trying to stay away from companies that even have a whiff of slave labor about them. things I'm not investing in AI Social media, though reddit as a pick and shovel play for ai is interesting to me precious metals: I have in the past, seems to popular these days again. the stability was in the relative unpopularity vs. fiat crypto: dont get me started. things I should be investing in: land myself <3 would love to hear everyone's thoughts. again, no financial advice here, just me musing out loud, we are all a Boltzmann brain floating in space....",

      "selftext_processed": "I am not_here to debate the bubbliness of it all or the merits or demerits of AI and all that or the timeline on which it will collapse . my original bet made in late 2023 was buying NVDIA Snap and Palantir puts that will expire worthless in two weeks unless I spend more to roll them . which I will not_so this is obviously not_financial advice as I am not_qualified to give it . and my timing sucked . io am however hedging in other ways . I just want to share thoughts on how I am hedging for what I think is going to be an AI bubble burst . again this is not_financial advice I am a monkey randomly hitting buttons here and will soon resort to avian augury to divine my path through the market . anyways . generally I think tech and anything AI especially are in a bubble right now . their market value keeps going up and their use generally is staying the same if not_optically decreasing to that last point more are more people are starting to see what is and what is not_vaporware in the ai space now and understand the limitations and value proposition of ai than they did a few years ago when this all started . AI has uses but when I say AI in terms of the bubble and industry I am talking about generative AI . I think that AI is one of the tools of the future just not_the pure generative kind . machine learning and other forms of AI that we have been developing for a long time are I think where the long term bet is at vis a vis AI as a stable market force rather than AI the generative AI industry . to that end I do have positions in TSMC as I believe that regardless of where the tech industry goes they other fabs and the people who supply them will be the ultimate winners of this bubble and they who will lose the least when the dust settles . Venezuela does put a slight damper in my the US wouldnt be that impatient and china is way too patient right mantra about Taiwan and TSMC but Im convinced Venezuela is an oil play and the orange man hates anything to do with computers or people who he cant bully . politics aside I think that companies like NVDIA and AMD will still be businesses after the dust settles as long as NVDIA isnt doing an ENRON but I just dont see their moat as impenetrable . and even if it is is it protecting as big a hoard as they thing we saw with deepseek that there are efficiency improvements to be found which could seriously cut into NVDIAs bottom line . it is only a matter of time until the market has to reckon with the fact that generative AI just does not_do what we want it to do . it is not_worth trillions of dollars at the moment in terms of return on investment . days months years Im not_sure but here are the things I think that are actually making the world a different better place and will change the world . basically good things to invest in for better or for worse that are not_AI . Geospatial tech . I think things like LIDAR improved GIS networks long range networks and network access are going to become huge . they already are but they represent incredible breakthroughs in how we understand the world and how we interact with it . also huge for how companies provide services BIOMED Crispr and mRNA and similar vaccines and therapies and the combination therein . right now the main thing holding these incredible technologies back from being something super commonplace in medicine is 1. no_real regulation on using it on embryos and fetuses or about engineering embryos there is a ban but at some point we will have to address the reality of the probability of use while trying to figure out what is medicine and what is eugenics quite the sticky wicket wouldnt you say since it could both very rapidly add to or detract from human genetic diversity in ways that are impossible to predict except that they have the potential to alter the evolutionary course of Homo sapiens and everything else on this planet 2. the process of using it now though effective is brutal and limited I think that the recent sickle cell cure requires someone with sickle cell anemia to undergo bone marrow removal chemo and radiation and then the marrow is replaced I dont know but it sounds like something not_everyone will be able to undergo yet unfortunately . 3. its so expensive . so so so expensive . millions of dollars for individualized treatment expensive . insurance may or may not_cover it expensive . 4. the political climate in many of the wealthiest developed nations vis a vis vaccines and biomedical breakthroughs is not_favorable . it is setting us back years or decades from cures . chips and batteries I dont know about large scale 50000k a pop chips but more and more computer chips are going in more and more things . I mean lego just chipped the brick . so my guess is more chips and eventually AI integration into things that people actually want tolike to use en masse . that means more battery life being used by the average device . even with battery breakthroughs it will be decades before the lithium battery in some form is replaced just because the infrastructure is so large and the demand is so rapidly growing . who knows whether we will all be using iPhones androids or whatever the next trend in phone or computer or electronic is but it will likely use batteries and it will likely use chips . If NVIDIA goes the way of Enron I think tsmc will still have a waitlist . hemp and marijuana I have both optimistic and cynical reasons for these picks . plenty of etfs around for cheap that have invested in OTC or private enterprises that are harder to invest in but profitable if things become legal andor more widely adopted in the western world . I think marijuana legalization would be a very bread and circuses move for a certain western leader or two and I think hemp has real potential in a resurgence for use in building materials and fiber applications among other things . I think that it is inevitable given the economics of hemp even big corporations at some point will have to admit using a weed for a lot of things is cheap someone will figure out the gummed up machinery thing soon I imagine interchangeable milling and harvesting heads but I digress and I am very slowly investing with the hope that inevitability comes relatively soon . that is more of a Hail Mary and totally at the mercy of political winds . china Im not_here to debate chinas ascendence to the world stage as one of the top superpowers . its been around a long time it will be around a long time and I kinda believe that . I think that they are a stability hedge with growth potential . not_to be stereotypical but china is ahead of the western world in almost every metric that seems important to a healthy future as a nation besides their political system which is honestly the most democratic its maybe ever been in its long history though this is mostly concerning problems of allegations of forced labor and some real systemic xenophobiaas an American I shall not_throw stones at glass houses and I believe that their economy is set up for success in that I believe that economies in a capitalistic world economy are only as successful as both the gross amount of resource that they exploit and the rate at which they exploit it . china has an incredible amount of natural and human resource to exploit and are rapidly increasing their capacity to exploit it in the long term via education and research renewable energy initiatives and policies meant to support the environment . I make no_ethical judgement there some is good some is bad again as an American cant speak to that one we have national parks . we also created the conditions for them to burn to ashes uncontrollably with the best of intentions . anyways I think chinas industry and economy in general is something I want to invest in trying to stay away from companies that even have a whiff of slave labor about them . things Im not_investing in AI Social media though reddit as a pick and shovel play for ai is interesting to me precious metals I have in the past seems to popular these days again . the stability was in the relative unpopularity vs. fiat crypto dont get me started . things I should be investing in land myself 3 would love to hear everyones thoughts . again no_financial advice here just me musing out loud we are all a Boltzmann brain floating in space ...."

      "selftext": "A lot of investing discussions focus on finding the “right stock,” but over time I’ve found that long-term results depend more on process than picks. Here are a few principles that seem to matter most: 1) Asset allocation > stock selection How you divide money between equities, bonds, and regions often explains more of your results than individual picks. 2) Compounding beats timing Missing strong market years usually hurts more than avoiding downturns helps. 3) Risk management protects returns Over-leverage, concentration, and emotional decisions can undo years of gains. 4) Behavior > strategy Even good strategies fail if investors panic, chase trends, or abandon plans. 5) Valuation matters long term Buying great businesses at unreasonable prices often leads to mediocre returns.",

Here are a few principles that seem to matter most 1 Asset allocation stock selection How you divide money between equities bonds and regions often explains more of your results than individual picks . 2 Compounding beats timing Missing strong market years usually hurts more than avoiding downturns helps . 3 Risk management protects returns Overleverage concentration and emotional decisions can undo years of gains . 4 Behavior strategy Even good strategies fail if investors panic chase trends or abandon plans . 5 Valuation matters long term Buying great businesses at unreasonable prices often leads to mediocre returns ."

      "selftext": "While many investors focus on Venezuela’s oil and gas sector as the most obvious play on the country’s reopening, digital economy leaders like MercadoLibre ($MELI) and Nubank ($NU) represent a more discreet but potentially powerful opportunity. Venezuela’s large population, high mobile penetration, and historically underdeveloped e‑commerce and financial infrastructure mean that companies with proven digital ecosystems in Latin America could capture outsized growth if economic and political conditions normalize. MercadoLibre, with its dominant marketplace and fintech platform Mercado Pago, is uniquely positioned to introduce online commerce and digital payments to a largely untapped market, offering a growth avenue that isn’t immediately obvious to traditional commodity-focused investors. Similarly, Nubank’s technology-driven banking model could quietly unlock value in Venezuela by serving an underbanked population. Unlike conventional banks, Nubank has experience scaling rapidly across Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia, offering low-cost, accessible financial products to millions. If Venezuelan financial markets open and consumers increasingly adopt digital banking solutions, Nubank could expand seamlessly, taking advantage of infrastructure gaps that legacy banks are slow to address. This potential remains under the radar compared with the headline-grabbing oil and gas plays. Both MercadoLibre and Nubank are essentially positioned to benefit from structural trends in Latin America, digital adoption, e‑commerce expansion, and financial inclusion, without relying on oil prices or resource exports. For investors seeking opportunities beyond the obvious energy sector, these digital leaders offer a stealthy way to capture the economic upside of Venezuela’s gradual reintegration into regional trade and finance, potentially generating outsized returns if the market begins to normalize.",

      "selftext": "There was a post here a few weeks ago of the Google insider who predicted the day that Gemini 3 would drop and all of Google’s search trends. They were right. On its own, that's nothing magical, but, they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information. For example: * \\#1 most searched movie on Google (8 cents -> 100 cents) * Gemini Flash not released by December 15 (23 cents -> 100 cents) * \\#1 most searched athlete (35 cents to 100 cents) * \\#2 most searched person (21 cents to 100 cents) There’s only one explanation, they are a Google employee making bank off insider information. And it just so happens, a few days ago, the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting *at least* a 50% score on FrontierMath’s Benchmark. So… that’s all cool and shit but how do I profit? Well let me explain it for you simpletons: I'm loading up on GOOG calls at open, AI is \\*\\*\\*the\\*\\*\\* market cap driver right now, and with the Gemini 3.0 release, everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But, if Gemini can score 70%+ on FrontierMath? That's a whole other ball game. That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers. his is a huge deal if this insider is right. They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents. Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something. Even if they're wrong, Google is mopping the floor with everyone else, it's not even a competition. I'll have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they don't hit in the next month. Long live Google, death to NVDA, and thank you Google insider for the free loot. Insider profile: polymarket user @ beepboopzyx",

On its own thats nothing_magical but they also predicted dozens of other markets correctly that could only be known using insider information . For example 1 most searched movie on Google 8 cents 100 cents Gemini Flash not_released by December 15 23 cents 100 cents 1 most searched athlete 35 cents to 100 cents 2 most searched person 21 cents to 100 cents There ’ s only one explanation they are a Google employee making bank off insider information . And it just so happens a few days ago the same account is back putting money on Gemini getting at least a 50 % score on FrontierMath ’ s Benchmark . So… that ’ s all cool and shit but how do I profit Well let me explain it for you simpletons Im loading up on GOOG calls at open AI is the market cap driver right now and with the Gemini 3.0 release everyone knows Google is slightly ahea But if Gemini can score 70 % on FrontierMath Thats a whole other ball game . That takes AI from helpful chat assistant to potentially publishing papers . his is a huge deal if this insider is right . They singlehandedly moved the odds from 8 cents to 45 cents . Conviction is balls deep and everyone knows they know something . Even if theyre wrong Google is mopping the floor with everyone else its not_even a competition . Ill have to roll my calls over to LEAPs if they dont hit in the next month . Long live Google death to NVDA and thank you Google insider for the free loot .

      "selftext": "Hear me out, not a huge fire sale after today's Goldman Sachs spooking but might not be a bad entry. Long SOFI, although Goldman Sachs lowered the target price from $27 to $24, they are maintaining a neutral rating indicating that they will not be offloading SOFI from their portfolios, which can be viewed as a positive for long term investors. On the other hand, Barclays increased target price from $24 to $28. At this point SOFI remains a top choice among retail investors to join the S&P 500. Q4 earnings are set to post on January 30^(th), expected revenue of $985.4 million and profit of $0.12 per share. Q3 revenue of $950 million beat analysts’ previous estimates of $895 million. So far this year, SOFI has risen 72%. Predicted high for this year is $38, with a low of $12. I’m looking for a entry point around $26.90, which after today’s offloading might not be a bad spot as I don't believe price per share will decrease after earnings on January 30th, thoughts?",

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining (like Texas) Given the current context, with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries, I’m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the **long term**? Going past Venezuela... From what I could find, names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero, Marathon, ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, PBF, and Motiva (Aramco). Is this it ? I don't know much about the sector Also, I’m generally not into stock picking. I tend to prefer ETFs",

But these refineries have been operating at low capacity usage for many years ... Heard they were made due to a concern that traditional US light oil production was declining like Texas Given the current context with the increase in heavy crude and these refineries I ’ m trying to understand which publicly traded companies would be interesting to own and benefit from this capacity for the long term Going past Venezuela ... From what I could find names that seem to have heavy investments in the Gulf are Valero Marathon ExxonMobil Chevron BP PBF and Motiva Aramco . Is this it I dont know much about the sector Also I ’ m generally not_into stock picking . I tend to prefer ETFs"

      "selftext": "Source: [ >Sandisk Corp. shares jumped 28% Tuesday, their best performance since February, after Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang highlighted the need for memory and storage in comments at the CES tech conference. >The stock is on a tear, leaping more than 47% in the first three trading sessions of 2026 and soaring 1,080% since hitting a low on April 22. It was the best performer in the S&P 500 Index Tuesday, followed by memory and storage companies Western Digital Corp. and Seagate Technology Holdings Plc, both of which posted double-digit percentage gains. >“For storage, that is a completely unserved market today,” Huang said at CES Monday. “This is a market that never existed, and this market will likely be the largest storage market in the world, basically holding the working memory of the world’s AIs.” >Tight supply and a surge in memory pricing amid a growing need for artificial intelligence training and inferencing is helping to boost digital storage stocks, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Jake Silverman. Huang’s comments at CES “suggest that demand for NAND storage will remain robust across Nvidia systems,” he said. >Memory prices have been steadily climbing. Earlier this week, Korea Economic Daily reported that Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix were seeking to raise server DRAM prices by 60% to 70% in the first quarter from the fourth quarter of last year. >Sandisk and other memory and storage companies are seen as “key beneficiaries” of the push for “AI inferencing and AI at the edge” in 2026, Bank of America analysts led by Wamsi Mohan wrote in a note to clients on Jan. 4. Mohan expects organizations to retain increasing amounts of data for training, analytics and compliance purposes, with demand for storage “skyrocketing in tandem.” In particular, he cited growing use in drones, surveillance, vehicles and sports technology. >“The focus of the AI investment theme has been levered so far to capex spending and a push for training AI models, that has created the next wave in hardware spending,” Mohan wrote. “As we look at 2026 and beyond, we expect AI Inference to dominate.”",

For me OKLO is one . Extremely high value at zero revenue . The nuclear core design is not_yet approved by authorities but they are all over the news with stock valuation ."

      "selftext": "The hands on test reveals Nvidia’s AI powered Drive platform is impressive. Nvidia’s Drive platform emphasizes predictability, safety, and modularity, contrasting Tesla’s more aggressive, end to end neural network approach. It’s designed for automakers and fleet operators, not direct to consumer use like Tesla FSD. For this reason, I disagree with the assertion within the article’s title at this time. The Verge’s test ride in a prototype vehicle showed smooth lane changes and merges, cautious behavior at intersections, and strong handling of complex urban scenarios. Nvidia’s platform runs on its Drive Thor chip, a next-gen AI processor designed for autonomous workloads. The system uses sensor fusion, combining lidar, radar, and cameras, for redundancy and reliability, unlike Tesla’s camera only approach. Nvidia is not building its own car but aims to power other automakers’ autonomous systems. Partners include Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, and Hyundai, who are integrating Nvidia’s tech into upcoming models.

      "selftext": "First, let me say, I’m a nobody in the stock trading world. I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life. I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late. Well, I’d like to share an observation that I’m not sure people are aware of. Copart is primarily a salvage auction. They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles, as well as other corporate sellers, such as charity donations, some fleet vehicles, and on occasion some dealers. But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage. I’m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not be the bargain people think it is. In 2013-2022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them. Used car prices were high, inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild. You could buy a wreck for 25% of it’s retail value, put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50% of the value of a similar used vehicle. That’s not true anymore. The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult. That’s another major issue. The tech in cars hadn’t quite reached the levels we see today. Parts interchangeability was a lot easier. Today, many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming. This not only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars, but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops. Overall, as these tech laden late model cars age, they’re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components. There’s still money to be made breaking cars apart, but there’s not nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past. Repair costs also continue to climb as parts, supplies and especially skilled labor increases. The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly. People also don’t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves. Especially as used car prices fall. It’s becoming much more attractive to buy in-wrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle. With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots, cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive. If you look at the bid no sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA, and Adesa, you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against. Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair (much of which you won’t know till you dig into the project) when you can buy a clean, in-wrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever. The truth is, there are more good reliable, well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them. Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers. Since the start of the trade war, tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US. Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars. There’s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations. Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company. There’s good reason that their market cap is declining.",

      "selftext_processed": "First let me say I ’ m a nobody_in the stock trading world . I have however been in the automotive industry my whole life . I keep seeing people suggesting Copart as a good buy due to its low share price of late . Well I ’ d like to share an observation that I ’ m not_sure people are aware of . Copart is primarily a salvage auction . They charge high fees for insurance companies to sell their salvage vehicles as well as other corporate sellers such as charity donations some fleet vehicles and on occasion some dealers . But the vast majority of their sales are cars that are fully written off due to serve damage . I ’ m going to lay out a few reasons Copart is facing some strong headwinds going forward and why the share price may not_be the bargain people think it is . In 20132022 there was a good business to be made from buying wrecked cars and rebuilding them . Used car prices were high inventory of good used cars was low and thus there was a significant margin to be made by buying wrecks to rebuild . You could buy a wreck for 25 % of it ’ s retail value put 40 hours and some capital into repairing it and still have a good car for 50 % of the value of a similar used vehicle . That ’ s not_true anymore . The margins are gone and the tech going forward will continue to make this more and more difficult . That ’ s another major issue . The tech in cars hadn ’ t quite reached the levels we see today . Parts interchangeability was a lot easier . Today many salvage parts are more difficult to interchange due to the need for dealer authorized software reprogramming . This not_only makes wrecks increasingly more difficult on late model cars but shrinks the salvage industries market share for good used parts to be sold to independent repair shops . Overall as these tech laden late model cars age they ’ re seeing higher depreciation than ever and lower margins for salvage companies to break them apart for their components . There ’ s still money to be made breaking cars apart but there ’ s not_nearly as much profit in a wrecked vehicle that there was in the past . Repair costs also continue to climb as parts supplies and especially skilled labor increases . The number of people able to do this kind of work is decreasing rapidly . People also don ’ t seem as interested in taking the risks to buy wrecks to rebuild themselves . Especially as used car prices fall . It ’ s becoming much more attractive to buy inwrecked cars with minor mechanical issues and deferred maintenance than to undergo a complete rebuild of a totaled vehicle . With used car depreciation and a surplus of used inventory sitting on lots cars are starting to sell wholesale for prices that make them much more attractive . If you look at the bid no_sale prices mounting up at auction houses like IAA and Adesa you begin to see the reckoning Copart is up against . Why buy a wrecked car that will come with a branded title and a lower resale value along with an increased risk of needing repair much of which you won ’ t know till you dig into the project when you can buy a clean inwrecked car from a dealer trade in at a lower delta than ever . The truth is there are more good reliable well cared for cars at auction right now than there are people with the means to buy them . Lastly many cars that used to go through Copart auctions were bought by foreign buyers . Since the start of the trade war tariffs have greatly affected the profitability of many exporters trying to buy cars from the US . Trade relations have a big effect on Copart sales and the values of salvage cars . There ’ s great risk to Copart from the standpoint of globalization failing and the US pulling back on global trade relations . Just be mindful of these issues if you are looking at Copart as a cheap company . There ’ s good reason that their market cap is declining ."

At Jan 6, 2026: Labe the CEO bought 57,612 shares at $6.57 Sajal Srivastava the President & CIO bought 57,612 shares at $6.57. On the Same day, same price, same size.

      "selftext": "Recently, I've seen a lot of discussion about whether SpaceX will go public. I'd like to share my thoughts. Although SpaceX is well-positioned in the rapidly developing aerospace industry, both SpaceX and Elon Musk have repeatedly stated that they have no plans to go public in the short term. They believe that an IPO would create short-term performance pressure, which would be detrimental to their long-term, high-risk space goals (especially the Mars program). SpaceX will only go public after substantial progress has been made on the Mars program. In my opinion, SpaceX doesn't lack funding; it collaborates with several private equity firms and national defense agencies. Its current valuation has already reached super-unicorn levels. A SpaceX IPO is not a matter of time, but a strategic decision. Of course, Starlink could also go public separately, and I believe the likelihood of a Starlink IPO is far higher than that of SpaceX. Therefore, I am very optimistic about Starlink's short-term prospects. Although I know many people dislike Musk, including myself, we are here to make money, so I hope everyone will express their opinions rationally. Thank you.",

Although SpaceX is wellpositioned in the rapidly developing aerospace industry both SpaceX and Elon Musk have repeatedly stated that they have no_plans to go public in the short term . They believe that an IPO would create shortterm performance pressure which would be detrimental to their longterm highrisk space goals especially the Mars program . SpaceX will only go public after substantial progress has been made on the Mars program . In my opinion SpaceX doesnt lack funding it collaborates with several private equity firms and national defense agencies . Its current valuation has already reached superunicorn levels . A SpaceX IPO is not_a matter of time but a strategic decision . Of course Starlink could also go public separately and I believe the likelihood of a Starlink IPO is far higher than that of SpaceX . Therefore I am very optimistic about Starlinks shortterm prospects . Although I know many people dislike Musk including myself we are here to make money so I hope everyone will express their opinions rationally . Thank you ."

With the satellites deploying and the partnership with giants like AT&T, the market is finally pricing in the reality of a global space-based cellular network Short Squeeze Potential: There are still plenty of bears trapped in their positions. A breakout to new highs will force them to cover, adding more fuel to the upward rocket I’ve been watching the charts closely, and the \"higher lows\" we’re seeing are a textbook bullish signal. Once the ATH is confirmed, my price target is $100+ I’m not going to hold this stock forever, but I’m definitely staying in for the duration of this breakout cycle.

Me (38m) has known about Boston Dynamics since I was in high school/early adulthood. I've always thought of them as like \"a leader\" in robotics, but maybe they are just the most well known? Their Atlas robot and Spot dog are pretty cool. Why aren't they publicly traded company? I know you can buy Hyundai, the parent company, just wondered why they weren't traded themselves, it seems like something people would be interested in. Would you invest? Why or why not? Are they just \"the name\" but aren't really the leader or innovators, or even really doing much in the space?",

Me 38m has known about Boston Dynamics since I was in high schoolearly adulthood . Ive always thought of them as like a leader in robotics but maybe they are just the most well known Their Atlas robot and Spot dog are pretty cool . Why arent they publicly traded company I know you can buy Hyundai the parent company just wondered why they werent traded themselves it seems like something people would be interested in . Would you invest Why or why not_Are they just the name but arent really the leader or innovators or even really doing much in the space"

      "selftext": "When Clover AI is the first thing doctors think about in the morning, CLOV belongs in the S&P 500. Share of mind→ market share. 1. Clover becomes a healthcare software company, not just an insurer. 2. Clover AI (Counterpart Health) isn’t admin software, it’s clinical decision intelligence. It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care, improving outcomes directly. The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time. 4. Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast, which is rare in Medicare Advantage. Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏. 5. Insiders collectively own \\\\\\~21% of the company. This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management’s incentives with shareholders. The biggest insider buy was by Co-Founder & Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli, who purchased approximatelyy $1M in shares at \\\\\\~$2.24 each. Market Confidence is back. Note: Not financial advice. Do your own DD. I’m just a guy on Reddit. PS: Any healthcare professionals or physicians here who use Counterpart Health (Clover AI)? I’d really appreciate hearing your feedback or experience. Thanks! Update: Posted this on another Reddit thread… still no solid responses from anyone actually using AI Clover Assistant. Holy moly 😅",

Clover becomes a healthcare software company not_just an insurer . 2 . Clover AI Counterpart Health isn ’ t admin software it ’ s clinical decision intelligence . It helps doctors decide what to do at the point of care improving outcomes directly . The moat is proprietary clinical data that gets smarter over time . 4 . Clover Health has crossed into profitability while still growing fast which is rare in Medicare Advantage . Hats off to Vivek and the team 🙏 . 5 . Insiders collectively own 21 % of the company . This level of insider stake is relatively high and is generally seen as aligning management ’ s incentives with shareholders . The biggest insider buy was by CoFounder Executive Chairman Vivek Garipalli who purchased approximatelyy $ 1M in shares at $ 2.24 each . Market Confidence is back . Note Not_financial advice . Do your own DD . I ’ m just a guy on Reddit . PS Any healthcare professionals or physicians here who use Counterpart Health Clover AI I ’ d really appreciate hearing your feedback or experience . Thanks Update Posted this on another Reddit thread… still no_solid responses from anyone actually using AI Clover Assistant . Holy moly 😅"

      "selftext": "Watching RIME today, it feels less like a one-off spike and more like the early phase of price discovery. The stock is up over 20% around $1.23, volume is above 1.2M shares, turnover is near 46%, and the day range has expanded beyond 30% (source type: live market data). Those are not normal conditions for a quiet penny stock. Price discovery phases usually come when new information forces participants to reassess assumptions. Over the past two weeks, RIME has delivered a steady flow of concrete updates: SemiCab ARR up 220% from $2.5M to over $8M, $15M forward ARR tied to signed contracts, and multiple major contract expansions including the Apollo Tyres announcement on Jan 6, 2026 (source type: company press releases). I am not trying to predict where this settles. I am watching how the market digests information now that liquidity and attention are both elevated. When you think a stock has entered price discovery mode, do you focus more on intraday structure or on how it behaves over the next few sessions? Do your own digging.",

      "selftext": "**TL;DR** FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening, despite decades of consistent, subscription-driven growth and high customer retention. The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles, while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations. The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI, but it will remain durable. **Background** FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors, asset managers, wealth firms, and corporates. Its product is embedded in client workflows, which makes switching painful and churn low. For this reason, retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure, cutting headcount, or seeing AUM decline. FactSet’s revenue doesn’t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity. Most revenue is subscription-based, which gives the business strong visibility and predictability. That model has worked for a long time. FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades. **Recent Earnings** In its most recent fiscal year (ended August 31, 2025), FactSet reported: • Revenue of $2.32B, up about 5% year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value (ASV) growth of ~5.7% • Net income of ~$597M, up ~11% • GAAP EPS of $15.55, up nearly 12% • Continued strong free cash flow, alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6% organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $2.42–2.45B. **Why Stock is Low** Margins have come under pressure, mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment. FactSet, however, isn’t spending defensively — it’s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data. **Why that Doesn’t Matter** A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data. That matters in an AI-driven environment. Many competitors rely more heavily on third-party data, which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top. FactSet’s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for. **Position**",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR FactSet is being valued as if its core business is weakening despite decades of consistent subscriptiondriven growth and high customer retention . The company continues to generate predictable cash flows through multiple market cycles while current valuation reflects unusually low expectations . The opportunity here is it is mispriced as risk due to AI but it will remain durable . Background FactSet sells financial data and analytics to institutional investors asset managers wealth firms and corporates . Its product is embedded in client workflows which makes switching painful and churn low . For this reason retention stays high even when asset managers are under pressure cutting headcount or seeing AUM decline . FactSet ’ s revenue doesn ’ t depend on optimism or inflows — it depends on necessity . Most revenue is subscriptionbased which gives the business strong visibility and predictability . That model has worked for a long time . FactSet has now grown revenue every year for over four decades . Recent Earnings In its most recent fiscal year ended August 31 2025 FactSet reported • Revenue of $ 2.32B up about 5 % year over year • Organic Annual Subscription Value ASV growth of 5.7 % • Net income of $ 597M up 11 % • GAAP EPS of $ 15.55 up nearly 12 % • Continued strong free cash flow alongside dividends and share buybacks Guidance for FY 2026 calls for 4–6 % organic ASV growth and revenue of roughly $ 2.42–2.45B . Why Stock is Low Margins have come under pressure mainly from higher compensation and ongoing technology investment . FactSet however isn ’ t spending defensively — it ’ s spending to deepen the product and expand how clients use its data . Why that Doesn ’ t Matter A key point that gets overlooked is that FactSet owns and curates a large portion of its proprietary data . That matters in an AIdriven environment . Many competitors rely more heavily on thirdparty data which limits pricing power and flexibility when new tools are layered on top . FactSet ’ s approach allows it to integrate AI into workflows without giving away the core asset that clients are paying for . Position"

One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform, Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor. >Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI, advanced reasoning models, and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, which combine a series of “expert” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks. >“Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment, as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement. >“With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI.” >In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs, the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips: the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch, Nvidia ConnectX-9 SuperNIC, Nvidia BlueField-4 DPU, and Nvidia Spectrum-6 Ethernet Switch. >All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia’s Vera Rubin NVL72 server, which combines 72 GPUs into a single system. Join several NVL72s together, and you get Nvidia’s DGX SuperPOD, a kind of massive AI supercomputer. These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on. >Nvidia is also touting its AI storage, called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage, which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillion-parameter and multi-step reasoning AI models. >All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia’s previous-generation Grace Blackwell offering. >According to the company, Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems. >Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks, improving efficiency. Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs. >Tokens in AI models represent things like words, parts of sentences, images, and videos. Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization. >But processing tokens is a resource-intensive, and therefore energy-hungry, process, especially when you’re dealing with enormous AI models. Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors. >Nvidia says it’s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production. >Nvidia’s chip lead has made it the world’s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $4.6 billion. In October, its market cap swelled to more than $5 trillion, but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price. >The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD (AMD), which is launching its own Helios racks-scale systems to compete with the NVLink 72, as well as its own customers. >In October, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) announced that Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) will expand the use of their respective custom processors, which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform. Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic. >And according to The Information, Google is having conversations with Meta (META) and other cloud companies about use of the search giant’s chips in their data centers. >Still, neither AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon. And if it’s able to continue its yearly release schedule, it will be even more difficult for them to catch up.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source AI powerhouse Nvidia NVDA announced the launch of its nextgeneration Vera Rubin superchip at CES 2026 on Monday in Las Vegas . One of six chips that make up what Nvidia is now calling its Rubin platform Vera Rubin combines one Vera CPU and two Rubin GPUs in a single processor . Nvidia is framing the Rubin platform as ideal for agentic AI advanced reasoning models and mixtureofexperts MoE models which combine a series of “ expert ” AIs and route queries to the appropriate one depending on the question a user asks . “ Rubin arrives at exactly the right moment as AI computing demand for both training and inference is going through the roof ” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement . “ With our annual cadence of delivering a new generation of AI supercomputers — and extreme codesign across six new chips — Rubin takes a giant leap toward the next frontier of AI. ” In addition to the Vera CPU and Rubin GPUs the Rubin platform includes four other networking and storage chips the Nvidia NVLink 6 Switch Nvidia ConnectX9 SuperNIC Nvidia BlueField4 DPU and Nvidia Spectrum6 Ethernet Switch . All of that can then be packaged together into Nvidia ’ s Vera Rubin NVL72 server which combines 72 GPUs into a single system . Join several NVL72s together and you get Nvidia ’ s DGX SuperPOD a kind of massive AI supercomputer . These huge systems are what hyperscalers like Microsoft Google Amazon and social media giant Meta are spending billions of dollars to get their hands on . Nvidia is also touting its AI storage called Nvidia Inference Context Memory Storage which the company says is necessary to store and share data generated by trillionparameter and multistep reasoning AI models . All of this is meant to make the Rubin platform more efficient than Nvidia ’ s previousgeneration Grace Blackwell offering . According to the company Rubin will result in a 4x reduction in the number of GPUs needed to train the same MoE versus Blackwell systems . Cutting down on the number of GPUs means companies would instead be able to put the excess units to work performing different tasks improving efficiency . Nvidia says Rubin also provides a 10x reduction in inference token costs . Tokens in AI models represent things like words parts of sentences images and videos . Models use tokens to break down these concepts into more easily processable pieces via tokenization . But processing tokens is a resourceintensive and therefore energyhungry process especially when you ’ re dealing with enormous AI models . Cutting down on the cost of tokens could provide improved total cost of ownership for Rubin versus its predecessors . Nvidia says it ’ s been sampling the Rubin platform with partners and is in full production . Nvidia ’ s chip lead has made it the world ’ s largest company by market cap with a valuation of roughly $ 4.6 billion . In October its market cap swelled to more than $ 5 trillion but concerns over AI spending and persistent fears about an AI ecosystem bubble brought its valuation down to its current price . The company is also facing more competition from rival AMD AMD which is launching its own Helios racksscale systems to compete with the NVLink 72 as well as its own customers . In October Google GOOG GOOGL and Amazon AMZN announced that Anthropic ANTH.PVT will expand the use of their respective custom processors which the AI company already uses to power its Claude platform . Both Google and Amazon have stakes in Anthropic . And according to The Information Google is having conversations with Meta META and other cloud companies about use of the search giant ’ s chips in their data centers . Still neither_AMD nor its own customers are likely to unseat Nvidia from its AI throne anytime soon . And if it ’ s able to continue its yearly release schedule it will be even more difficult for them to catch up ."

      "selftext": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for some guidance and opinions. I’m a 47 year old small business owner in Pennsylvania. I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025. He’s now 1.5 years old, and I plan to contribute roughly $10,000 per year going forward. I automatically put $100 in each week plus Christmas/birthday money goes in I’ve been trying to do my due diligence, but honestly there’s so much information out there that I’m getting confused, and I’m not confident I’m approaching this the right way. So far he has 6 shares of NVDA, 59 shares of FSELX, 29 shares of FSPGX, 300 shares of HGRAF & 22 shares of KGC. This is meant to be a long-term growth account (college, early adulthood, etc.). I’m open to a “set and forget” approach if that’s the smartest move. I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly second-guessing myself. Should I just VOO or VTI and chill? Thanks in advance! I really appreciate the help!",

I opened a Fidelity UTMA for my son when he turned 1 year old in July 2025 . He ’ s now 1.5 years old and I plan to contribute roughly $ 10000 per year going forward . I automatically put $ 100 in each week plus Christmasbirthday money goes in I ’ ve been trying to do my due diligence but honestly there ’ s so much information out there that I ’ m getting confused and I ’ m not_confident I ’ m approaching this the right way . So far he has 6 shares of NVDA 59 shares of FSELX 29 shares of FSPGX 300 shares of HGRAF 22 shares of KGC . This is meant to be a longterm growth account college early adulthood etc .. I ’ m open to a “ set and forget ” approach if that ’ s the smartest move . I mainly want something sensible and repeatable each year without constantly secondguessing myself . Should I just VOO or VTI and chill Thanks in advance I really appreciate the help"

The issue is someone with lots of money doubled the stock before my purchase went through and I missed most of the stock price increase so far. I know traditionally index funds and etfs were better for people like me but the US stock market with this K shaped economy is not traditional.

      "selftext": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security, specifically to Uranium & Rare Earths. I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days. Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed, I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand. Check this: Uranium isn’t ripping because of headlines. It’s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action. For years the narrative was “renewables can do it” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible. That was suppression. Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression. Inventories got drained. Mines stayed closed. Licensing stayed slow. Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing. Now you’re seeing the change. Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance: Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing, deployment, and implementation of nuclear energy policies. That hearing isn’t symbolic, it’s strategic. Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can’t meet AI and industrial demand any other way. ￼ This isn’t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point. This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog. That’s the kind of government-level pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security. ￼ You can see markets already moving on this. NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn’t just talk - congressional heat makes it more real. ￼ All the anti-nuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue. AI energy demand exposed the grid’s limitations, and the same committee that has talked about AI’s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes. ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression. When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year, that signals policy momentum, not posturing. Politicians aren’t just parroting soundbites -they’re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed. That’s why uranium is behaving the way it is. This isn’t a retail meme rally. This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints. The market was suppressed. Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress. Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it. If they were just talking, prices wouldn’t care. But this is action. And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up. Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history (outside of bitcoin) and you all are sleeping.

      "selftext_processed": "Yesterday I posted on the true meaning of Venezeula to energy security specifically to Uranium Rare Earths . I want to take this up a notch and focus specifically on nuclear given I received many questions on why the space is receiving more attention these days . Outside of the utilities and macro headwinds previously discussed I want to discuss what our elected officials are focusing in on and doing and driving up demand . Check this Uranium isn ’ t ripping because of headlines . It ’ s ripping because politicians are admitting the problem out loud and backing real action . For years the narrative was “ renewables can do it ” while nuclear got dragged through every political fight possible . That was suppression . Cheap uranium prices were part of that suppression . Inventories got drained . Mines stayed closed . Licensing stayed slow . Meanwhile actual power demand kept growing . Now you ’ re seeing the change . Chairmen Brett Guthrie and Bob Latta of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce just announced a congressional hearing titled American Energy Dominance Dawn of the New Nuclear Era to talk licensing deployment and implementation of nuclear energy policies . That hearing isn ’ t symbolic it ’ s strategic . Lawmakers are openly trying to push nuclear licensing and deployment as policy priorities because the grid can ’ t meet AI and industrial demand any other way . ￼ This isn ’ t Republicans and Democrats just saying they like nuclear as a talking point . This is the actual committee that controls energy policy holding a hearing to discuss how to execute recent laws and federal policies that boost nuclear growth and address licensing backlog . That ’ s the kind of governmentlevel pressure that forces utilities and suppliers to reprioritize contracts and fuel security . ￼ You can see markets already moving on this . NuScale Power stock jumped double digits because traders are pricing the fact that faster licensing and deployment isn ’ t just talk congressional heat makes it more real . ￼ All the antinuclear talking points have gone silent just as lawmakers start treating nuclear like a national energy and security issue instead of an environmental wedge issue . AI energy demand exposed the grid ’ s limitations and the same committee that has talked about AI ’ s massive power needs months ago is now turning straight to nuclear as the only scalable solution that checks political and logistical boxes . ￼ This is the political backing that breaks suppression . When the House Energy and Commerce Committee puts nuclear licensing and deployment in the spotlight at the start of the year that signals policy momentum not_posturing . Politicians aren ’ t just parroting soundbites they ’ re holding hearings that force regulatory timelines forward and clarify where future federal support and direction are headed . That ’ s why uranium is behaving the way it is . This isn ’ t a retail meme rally . This is political recognition meeting real energy constraints . The market was suppressed . Now that suppression is being dismantled at the policy level while utilities and miners watch their future fuel needs get legitimized by Congress . Uranium is moving because politicians are finally putting muscle behind it . If they were just talking prices wouldn ’ t care . But this is action . And markets respond to action before the headlines catch up . Uranium is the greatest bull cycle in history outside of bitcoin and you all are sleeping .

      "selftext": "Although this outcome isn't guaranteed, it's absolutely certain that markets would react swiftly to this announcement, which is due within the next few months (possibly even days or weeks). It stands to reason that if tariffs are overturned, importers would benefit significantly. This is because they won't be subject to import fees and will be able to either lower their prices and gain market share, or keep current maintain market share and lower their overhead costs. This includes retailers like Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), as well as tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA). Similarly, domestic manufacturing like Nucor steel (NUE) and United States Steel (X) would suffer from this ruling. This is because they will suffer from higher operating costs and will loose profit margins, or ultimately loose market share due to these higher costs. Others I think will vary over time. For example, Caterpillar (CAT) might suffer initially since they manufature in the US, but they might gain long term due to lower capital overhead. I think these are all reasonable bets, but who do you think stands to benefit or loose the most? Which stocks would be the most timely to purchase based on other factors? I'm interested mostly in purchasing rather than shorting, but would enjoy takes on both long term and short term gains.",

We think we’re gonna keep her /s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time. From time to time, I’m in the living room with her watching it. It is…a good show tbh. Great dialogue. I digress. In on episode, Lorelai’s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant. $75,000. A great windfall for sure. But it got me thinking-how could I do something similar for my daughter? What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this. I obviously don’t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai. I, after all, am not a Yale alumnus (lowly state school offspring here) and am not known for making the best picks in the market. I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA. Anyways, how could I go about doing this for my daughter? Some sort of brokerage account for children? Thanks in advance.",

We think we ’ re gon na keep her s Anyways the wife is home on baby leave and devouring Gilmore Girls for the fifth time . From time to time I ’ m in the living room with her watching it . It is…a good show tbh . Great dialogue . I digress . In on episode Lorelai ’ s father Richard gifts her the financial gains from an investment he made for her when she was an infant . $ 75000 . A great windfall for sure . But it got me thinkinghow could I do something similar for my daughter What would be the best vehicle to accomplish this . I obviously don ’ t expect the same returns as Richard gained on the investment for Lorelai . I after all am not_a Yale alumnus lowly state school offspring here and am not_known for making the best picks in the market . I have since distilled my portfolio down into an extremely boring albeit stable mix of stocks and practice DCA . Anyways how could I go about doing this for my daughter Some sort of brokerage account for children Thanks in advance ."

      "selftext": "Phillips 66 (PSX) has announced its agreement to acquire the Lindsay Refinery assets and related infrastructure in the UK. This move is set to bolster their operations, especially as they integrate the assets into their Humber Refinery. The company has stated that after thorough evaluations, it decided not to restart Lindsay’s independent operations due to scale and operational constraints. Instead, Phillips 66 will incorporate these assets into its existing refinery system, potentially leading to improved efficiency and synergies. With this acquisition, Phillips 66 is making strategic moves to strengthen its position in the energy sector and diversify its operations. The decision not to revive Lindsay as an independent refinery seems prudent, as it could streamline operations and avoid the risk of a costly restart. Given the broader push towards sustainable fuels and Phillips 66's strong presence in the refining market, this could be a good time to consider adding PSX to your portfolio. Do you think this acquisition will positively impact PSX’s long term growth and stock performance?",

      "title": "SEZL is the BEST setup for 2026: Flipping the Script on BNPL",
      "selftext": "TLDR: Sezzle (SEZL) is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026. \\~15 Forward P/E for 2026 w earnings growing \\~30%. Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76% while maintaining 28% net income margins, and it is even rarer to find it trading at just \\~14x forward earnings. Sezzle (SEZL) is that company. Sezzle provides flexible, consumer focused ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ financing and credit-building tools specifically designed for the underserved market. While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise, Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy, pivoting to a high-LTV subscription model that self-funds its own expansion. The setup here looks very attractive. You have a founder-CEO, Charlie, who has his entire net worth in the company, owning roughly 44%, 2.4 million pre-split shares (approx. 14.4m post split), and has never sold a share… plus, he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger: # BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most, I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards, but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can’t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28% as a standard when it used to be like 12-15%. The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing. Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything. If you polled me, nearly 100% of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection, travel rewards, etc. Unlike a credit card, SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance. They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice. # Consumer-Sided vs. Merchant-Sided A few years ago, Sezzle switched from the typical “merchant-sided” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller, to a consumer-sided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm. SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumer-friendly, consumer driven experience. They charge the consumer. SEZL’s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool - accessible, budget flexibility, and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure. The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing - offering promos, price comparisons, featured products etc. **Merchant Sided**: Driven by merchant access and promotion. Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself. **Consumer Sided**: SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer. It is consumer-driven rather than merchant-driven. Because of this, Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer. Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted, rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted. Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items. Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 6-12-24 month plans and interest. They do offer the traditional pay-in-4 but its focus is higher ticket. This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL’s. # Customer Sezzle targets subprime and near-prime consumers, a bit more ‘risky’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL. They utilize AI and new infrastructure to risk-assess users that traditional banks reject. SEZL allows users to opt-in for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up. They reward responsible use with increased access, but they have strict usage limits, you cannot use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance. Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $3,500 limit immediately, Sezzle starts with micro approvals of \\~$50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage. The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks, not a way to rack up revolving debt at 28% APR. SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary non-FICO approval methods, monitoring, limits etc.. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not - if it’s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times. # Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth, prioritizing profitable growth strategies. One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses. They pride themselves on it to expand leverage. They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money. On the calls I’ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘expansion’ In Q2 Management recently noted: “With top line growth of 76% YoY, gross margins of 61% and a net income margin of 28%, we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version, the Rule of 100, where we scored a 165 this quarter.” **History of Raising Guidance**: Split-adjusted guidance for FY24 started at $2.00. It moved to $2.50-$3.00, then $3.25, and recently to $3.52. Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $4.35. **Valuation\\*:** We are looking at a \\~18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS. **PEG Ratio:** SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60. For reference, a PEG of <1 is generally considered undervalued. (PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock’s Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio by its expected earnings growth rate, adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings.) NOTE: the drop in Sezzle’s (SEZL) Q2 2025 TTM (Trailing Twelve Month) EPS drop is primarily due to a **one-time significant tax benefit in Q2 2024** rolling off the twelve-month calculation. **Operating Income actually grew by 116%** year-over-year (from $16.7M in Q2 ‘24 to $36.1M in Q2 ‘25). Underlying SEZL’s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers. As of Q3, SEZL reports a cash position of $134.7m vs $118m in debt for a net cash position of $16.7m and a healthy Total Debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.76. In addition, the company recently expanded its credit facility to $225m. With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90%, SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow. While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable, Klarna has shifted back to a net loss. Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency, a \\~36% Operating Margin and \\~27% Net Income Margin, providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its high-volume, thin-margin competitors do not possess. Additionally, SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility. To highlight SEZL’s focus on profitability, it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks. This is not the case with SEZL, despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58%, they continue to post positive cash flow. SEZL’s short payback period of 4-6 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn. They are successfully self-funding their 58% GMV growth. # Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good. There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1%, but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don’t have a history with the company, it’s almost like a CAC/marketing expense. Charlie clarified it’s right where they anticipate though, that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers, but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year. He basically said ‘we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4, that should be understood.’ I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY. I also don’t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions, I’d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out. Monthly On Demand and Subs (MODS) grew 48% YoY Active consumers grew 11.4%. GMV grew 58.7% Revenue grew 67% YoY and adjusted net income was $25.4M this quarter, up 53% YoY **Why is Revenue growing at >60% but active consumers by 12%?** Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL. The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions. It’s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens - 67% vs 48%. Last quarter it was 62% YoY MODS (monthly on demand and subs). They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster. They noticed the conversion wasn’t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward, noted as a reason for growth change. Refocusing on prioritizing subs. On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand. In addition - SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth. They stress it on all the calls. Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc. so there will likely be a spike in user growth. I think of Active consumers as “the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle” - this pool was built with growth/exposure first in mind - and then they try to transition them into subscribers - growing the pool of high value long term value consumers. So the “active users” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer. The gap remains 2971-784=2,187 Active Users that are not MODS/Subscribers. MODS is currently 26% of actives. Last year Q3 it was 19.8%. So they are eating into this pie, converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth. Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions, more transactions (avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x). Also, the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10% but GMV grows 20% the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees. GMV grew 58.7%, subscribers made 10x more transactions, and there is cross selling new products (fee for credit building product etc). SEZL’s Formula for Leveraged Growth: Base consumer growth + conversion to high value subscribers + cross selling products to increase customer LTV + increase usage/GMV + growing take rate = fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth. Take rate is 11.2%, increasing 60bps YoY. With a pivot to higher-margin subscriptions (MODS), a growing take rate (\\~13%), and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast, I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound. # Q4/Q1 Accounting It is important to note, SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations. There were previous sell-offs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this. **Q4:** In Holiday seasons there is typically **a m**assive GMV spike. Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk. This depresses the net income for the Q. **Following Q1,** Revenue is recognized when paid (fees/payments). Since Sezzle is a a 4-6 week BNPL payoff, the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1. Q1 often shows lower GMV but all-time high Revenue. GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not recognize the revenue until Q1. This creates weird QoQ comparisons, but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue, gross margins remain north of 60%. # Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lenders/BNPLs. This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines. IMO, BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those long-term debts. Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products, but in the short term I think the impact is different. BNPL is very short term in nature - particularly SEZL - and as management would argue, they are “more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks,” rather than a traditional credit product. 1. It’s much easier to pay $120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $500 car loan or $300 student loan. 2. Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term. 4 $30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $300 and $500 payment monthly for 12-36-indefinite months. 3. BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable. 4. There is almost an anti-student loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness. 5. BNPL can also be a symptom/result of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted, maxed, or unavailable. And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not allow follow up loans without payoff. Ultimately - i am not arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now. I believe there’s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like cars/student loans. Also - pulling from an old Value Investors Club write-up on SEZL, the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that: “Sezzle is not afraid of a recession. Their customer is already in distress. Moreover, they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad. Because Sezzle’s target is subprime customer they are not afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Pay-in-4 as competition.” Nonetheless, despite my above points, there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs. A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation. SEZL’s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such, if customer spending contracts, revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate. And while SEZL’s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.5-3% range, a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test. Fortunately, because of wide-spread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space, I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL’s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk. If you are interested in SEZL, I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential, but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile. At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger. **ALSO - CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated:** The CFPB finds that \"BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products.\" BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting. Charge-offs went back to 2020 stimulus-check era lows, but lenders noted the decrease is driven by \"improved credit models\" and \"shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers.\" This is SEZL exact model. **I own SEZL and am buying at these levels.** EDIT: position",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDR Sezzle SEZL is one of the best setup stocks going into 2026 . 15 Forward PE for 2026 w earnings growing 30 % . Discounted due to subprime BNPL sentiment but it will push through . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . It is rare to find a company growing its top line at 76 % while maintaining 28 % net income margins and it is even rarer to find it trading at just 14x forward earnings . Sezzle SEZL is that company . Sezzle provides flexible consumer focused ‘ Buy Now Pay Later ’ financing and creditbuilding tools specifically designed for the underserved market . While the headlines focus on subprime fears and regulatory noise Sezzle has executed a profitable growth strategy pivoting to a highLTV subscription model that selffunds its own expansion . The setup here looks very attractive . You have a founderCEO Charlie who has his entire net worth in the company owning roughly 44 % 2.4 million presplit shares approx . 14.4m post split and has never_sold a share… plus he regularly quotes Buffett and Munger BNPL vs Credit Cards Probably contrary to most I am of the opinion that properly run BNPL is entirely more ethical and consumer supportive than credit cards but the credit card industry has created a sentiment that using BNPL is somehow buying things that you can ’ t afford when in reality America lives on credit cards that now charge 28 % as a standard when it used to be like 1215 % . The amount of headlines citing BNPL usage while ignoring that BNPL has existed for decades in the form of Credit Cards is mind blowing . Headlines citing BNPL use to buy groceries straight up ignore the fact that the majority of American shoppers are swiping their credit cards for everything . If you polled me nearly 100 % of my spending would be using BNPL in the form of credit cards regardless of the fact that I pay them off weekly and do so for added purchase protection travel rewards etc . Unlike a credit card SEZL refuses to allow additional BNPL purchases if there is an unpaid balance . They also have the ability to remove buying power instantly in the event of a downturn where credit cards typically need to give 45 day notice . ConsumerSided vs. MerchantSided A few years ago Sezzle switched from the typical “ merchantsided ” BNPL model which works primarily through the seller to a consumersided model which differentiates them from competitors like Affirm . SEZL is inherently focused on being a consumerfriendly consumer driven experience . They charge the consumer . SEZL ’ s pitch towards consumers is that it is a financial wellness tool accessible budget flexibility and a way to build credit with Sezzle Up vs revolving Credit Card exposure . The app is extremely user friendly and is a promotional store that encourages return to app for browsing offering promos price comparisons featured products etc . Merchant Sided Driven by merchant access and promotion . Merchants participate to increase sales but the BNPL eats into merchant margins to provide a benefit and has inherently lower margins itself . Consumer Sided SEZL flipped the script and essentially developed an underwriting and approval process for the consumer . It is consumerdriven rather than merchantdriven . Because of this Sezzle operates in the wallet of the consumer . Things like the Sezzle Anywhere subscription essentially allow it to be used anywhere Visa is accepted rather than the consumer having to hunt for a merchant where SEZL is accepted . Another notable difference to Affirm is that Affirm is focused primarily on merchant partners that have higher value ticket items . Affirm has much longer term product focus that rivals traditional loans etc with 61224 month plans and interest . They do offer the traditional payin4 but its focus is higher ticket . This is why their AOV is significantly higher than SEZL ’ s . Customer Sezzle targets subprime and nearprime consumers a bit more ‘ risky ’ but they are very selective in who they approve and are serving a population that is underserved by both credit cards and other BNPL . They utilize AI and new infrastructure to riskassess users that traditional banks reject . SEZL allows users to optin for credit reporting and pitch it as a tool to build credit via Sezzle Up . They reward responsible use with increased access but they have strict usage limits you can not use Sezzle if you have an unpaid or overdue balance . Unlike traditional credit cards that might give a $ 3500 limit immediately Sezzle starts with micro approvals of $ 50 and allows users to increase their lines of credit with responsible usage . The company is big on promoting Sezzle as a budgeting tool to spread a single cost over 6 weeks not_a way to rack up revolving debt at 28 % APR . SEZL says they differentiate themselves with proprietary nonFICO approval methods monitoring limits etc .. there is inherent risk here and it comes down to if that is legit or not_ if it ’ s just talk during good times or it will hold up during tough times . Financials Management prides themselves on efficient growth prioritizing profitable growth strategies . One of SEZL core principles though is extremely efficient cost control and expenses . They pride themselves on it to expand leverage . They are a huge turnaround story because their prior business model failed and they had to ruthlessly cut expenses and now they pride themselves on their efficient use of money . On the calls I ’ ve listened to he regularly refers to how certain companies just burn cash in the name of ‘ expansion ’ In Q2 Management recently noted “ With top line growth of 76 % YoY gross margins of 61 % and a net income margin of 28 % we remain well ahead of the Rule of 40 and our own version the Rule of 100 where we scored a 165 this quarter. ” History of Raising Guidance Splitadjusted guidance for FY24 started at $ 2.00 . It moved to $ 2.50 $ 3.00 then $ 3.25 and recently to $ 3.52 . Preliminary guidance for next year is already at $ 4.35 . Valuation We are looking at a 18.40 TTM and a FWD PE of 14.20 based on FY26 guidance of 4.35 EPS . PEG Ratio SEZL is trading at a FWD PEG of 0.60 . For reference a PEG of 1 is generally considered undervalued . PEG ratio is a valuation calculated by dividing a stock ’ s PricetoEarnings PE ratio by its expected earnings growth rate adjusting the PE to show whether a company is undervalued or overvalued relative to how fast it is expected to grow earnings . NOTE the drop in Sezzle ’ s SEZL Q2 2025 TTM Trailing Twelve Month EPS drop is primarily due to a onetime significant tax benefit in Q2 2024 rolling off the twelvemonth calculation . Operating Income actually grew by 116 % yearoveryear from $ 16.7M in Q2 ‘ 24 to $ 36.1M in Q2 ‘ 25 . Underlying SEZL ’ s operational momentum is its balance sheet that separates it from more levered peers . As of Q3 SEZL reports a cash position of $ 134.7m vs $ 118m in debt for a net cash position of $ 16.7m and a healthy Total DebtEBITDA ratio of 0.76 . In addition the company recently expanded its credit facility to $ 225m . With an interest coverage ratio of 17x and a Return on Equity of 90 % SEZL is using its capital to efficiently and profitably grow . While Affirm has recently become slightly GAAP profitable Klarna has shifted back to a net loss . Sezzle differentiates itself with superior capital efficiency a 36 % Operating Margin and 27 % Net Income Margin providing a cushion against macroeconomic headwinds that its highvolume thinmargin competitors do not_possess . Additionally SEZL has crossed an inflection point and has been Free Cash Flow positive since Q1 2024 providing ample cash generation for growth and flexibility . To highlight SEZL ’ s focus on profitability it is important to note that rapid growth fintech lenders typically have negative cash flow as they send cash out to merchants faster than they receive paybacks . This is not_the case with SEZL despite increasing Gross Merchandise Value by 58 % they continue to post positive cash flow . SEZL ’ s short payback period of 46 weeks allows it to fund organic growth without the need for external cash burn . They are successfully selffunding their 58 % GMV growth . Q3 Earnings I thought results and call were good . There was a slight uptick in provision for credit losses to 3.1 % but with SEZL new customers get higher provisions as they don ’ t have a history with the company it ’ s almost like a CACmarketing expense . Charlie clarified it ’ s right where they anticipate though that On Demand also increased it a bit due to more new customers but that their guidance has been clear and they are in line for full year . He basically said ‘ we guided full year and we were under it Q1 and Q2 so that implies it will be higher in Q3 and Q4 that should be understood. ’ I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY . I also don ’ t hate small proactive upticks in credit loss provisions I ’ d much prefer that than under provisioning for losses as any over provision results in smaller future provisions to balance them out . Monthly On Demand and Subs MODS grew 48 % YoY Active consumers grew 11.4 % . GMV grew 58.7 % Revenue grew 67 % YoY and adjusted net income was $ 25.4M this quarter up 53 % YoY Why is Revenue growing at 60 % but active consumers by 12 % Active consumers means they have made a purchase on SEZL . The real driver of revenue growth is subscriptions . It ’ s much more in line growth rate if you view it from that lens 67 % vs 48 % . Last quarter it was 62 % YoY MODS monthly on demand and subs . They were marketing on demand big time as a driver they hoped would convert to subs faster . They noticed the conversion wasn ’ t happening as much as they liked so they cut back on the marketing spend to pivot going forward noted as a reason for growth change . Refocusing on prioritizing subs . On demand is still accretive and is offered to people hesitant to subscribe but they want to focus more on lifetime value which is in a sub over on demand . In addition SEZL mgmt lives by the idea of profitable growth . They stress it on all the calls . Q4 is also historically a supercharged growth quarter because holidays etc . so there will likely be a spike in user growth . I think of Active consumers as “ the universe that has been introduced to Sezzle ” this pool was built with growthexposure first in mind and then they try to transition them into subscribers growing the pool of high value long term value consumers . So the “ active users ” can slow down as long as MODS continues to grow as the margin of MODS is much higher than a transaction consumer . The gap remains 29717842187 Active Users that are not_MODSSubscribers . MODS is currently 26 % of actives . Last year Q3 it was 19.8 % . So they are eating into this pie converting to higher value customers which is driving revenue and profit growth with leverage vs active customer growth . Revenue can grow faster than consumer base with more subscriptions more transactions avg purchase growing from 5.4 to 6.5x . Also the more transactions the more merchant fees so if customers grow 10 % but GMV grows 20 % the increased volume results in greater revenue growth via transaction fees . GMV grew 58.7 % subscribers made 10x more transactions and there is cross selling new products fee for credit building product etc . SEZL ’ s Formula for Leveraged Growth Base consumer growth conversion to high value subscribers cross selling products to increase customer LTV increase usageGMV growing take rate fuel for revenue growth at leverage greater than base consumer growth . Take rate is 11.2 % increasing 60bps YoY . With a pivot to highermargin subscriptions MODS a growing take rate 13 % and a rapidly increasing EPS forecast I feel Sezzle is fundamentally sound . Q4Q1 Accounting It is important to note SEZL has some funky Q4 Holiday Season accounting so it is important to bake it into expectations . There were previous selloffs seemingly based on investor misinterpretations of this . Q4 In Holiday seasons there is typically a massive GMV spike . Sezzle must provision for losses immediately in Q4 to account for the risk . This depresses the net income for the Q . Following Q1 Revenue is recognized when paid feespayments . Since Sezzle is a a 46 week BNPL payoff the revenue from the Q4 holiday spend is actually received and recognized into Q1 . Q1 often shows lower GMV but alltime high Revenue . GAAP accounting requires them to provision for losses in Q4 but not_recognize the revenue until Q1 . This creates weird QoQ comparisons but if you look at the cost of transaction processing relative to revenue gross margins remain north of 60 % . Risks There is a valid concern regarding consumer pressure and risks associated with subprime focused lendersBNPLs . This negative sentiment seems to be particularly high lately with spillover from subprime auto and student loan debt headlines . IMO BNPL is apples and oranges compared to those longterm debts . Obviously increased downward consumer pressure will ultimately affect all credit type products but in the short term I think the impact is different . BNPL is very short term in nature particularly SEZL and as management would argue they are “ more of a budgeting tool to spread a single cost across 4 weeks ” rather than a traditional credit product . 1 . It ’ s much easier to pay $ 120 total over 4 weeks than it is to pay $ 500 car loan or $ 300 student loan . 2 . Short term in nature provides the ability to resolve in the short term . 4 $ 30 payments is much more achievable than a recurring $ 300 and $ 500 payment monthly for 1236indefinite months . 3 . BNPL is a conscious decision to spend $ X amount of dollars in a single purchase vs having made a probably inappropriate long term commitment to something that is unaffordable . 4 . There is almost an antistudent loan sentiment with recent grad unemployment and also a build up of unexpected loan repayment following all the talks about forgiveness . 5 . BNPL can also be a symptomresult of those delinquency rates as people turn to non traditional credit as their traditional access is impacted maxed or unavailable . And in turn prioritize maintaining access to liquidity of ability to access BNPL for everyday needs by ensuring they pay it off as companies like SEZL do not_allow follow up loans without payoff . Ultimately i am not_arguing BNPL is immune but providing some insights on the lack of visible impact right now . I believe there ’ s a host of financial and psychological reasons from different perspectives that actually make BNPL resilient to the delinquency numbers we see in things like carsstudent loans . Also pulling from an old Value Investors Club writeup on SEZL the author noted that in a conversation with the SVP of IR reflected that “ Sezzle is not_afraid of a recession . Their customer is already in distress . Moreover they expect more people to use BNPL services if the economy goes bad . Because Sezzle ’ s target is subprime customer they are not_afraid of Apple Pay Later or PayPal Payin4 as competition. ” Nonetheless despite my above points there is a real risk in the cyclical nature of BNPLs . A recession or prolonged consumer weakness will impact SEZL via GMV compression and credit degradation . SEZL ’ s revenue is directly tied to GMV and as such if customer spending contracts revenue growth could meaningfully decelerate . And while SEZL ’ s loss provisioning has remained sufficient in the 2.53 % range a true recessionary environment will put their underwriting process and credit provisions to the test . Fortunately because of widespread negative sentiment regarding the subprime space I feel much of this is presently baked into SEZL ’ s compressed multiple and the upside outweighs the downside risk . If you are interested in SEZL I think the current price provides a great entry point with significant upside potential but keep in mind this stock has proven to be very volatile . At these valuations SEZZLE is setup to be a potential multibagger . ALSO CFPB agrees BNPL negative sentiment is overstated The CFPB finds that BNPL imposes significantly lower direct financial costs on consumers than legacy credit products . BNPL losses are now less than half of the legacy credit cards it replaces signifying the strength of the underwriting . Chargeoffs went back to 2020 stimuluscheck era lows but lenders noted the decrease is driven by improved credit models and shifting focus on increasing usage by their existing customers . This is SEZL exact model . I own SEZL and am buying at these levels . EDIT position"

      "selftext": "2025 was a very fruitful year for me. All three major stock indices rose, with the Nasdaq Composite performing best, gaining 25%-30% for the year, significantly outperforming the broader market and ultimately emerging as the winner. If you had chosen a stock from this index and held it for a year, the probability of profit would have been as high as 70%. If you held a portfolio of stocks from Nvidia, Intel, or other semiconductor companies, the return would have exceeded 40%. How did your stock portfolio perform? Of course, 2025 was also a lucky year for me. Through discussions with some friends in the investment community, I gained some valuable information and benefited greatly. Therefore, I sold my underperforming stocks and bought some shares of Nvidia, Intel, and AVGO. Although there were some fluctuations, I ultimately achieved a good return. Market news is often more important than technical analysis. I recently learned that the artificial intelligence bubble is expanding, and the market is starting to shift to other industries, which will become new growth points next year. There is a good chance that some new hot stocks will emerge, performing even better than Nvidia. I am still closely monitoring the situation and waiting for the right opportunity.",

      "selftext": "One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias. A lot of SemiCab's traction has been in India, and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand. I see this all the time with microcaps: international wins get treated like \"nice, but does it work in the U.S.?\" even when the economics are already meaningful. The Dec 22, 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss. The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100% to 600% (source type: company press release). The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $6M, described as the largest in SemiCab history, and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183. The release also notes Asian Paints has over $4B in annual sales, which gives context on customer size (source type: company press release). Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220% from $2.5M in January to over $8M by December and cited a forward-looking ARR of $15M based on current contracts and expansions (source type: company press release). If that run-rate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography, the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex. Do your own research.",

      "selftext_processed": "One reason I think RIME stays mispriced is a simple geographic bias . A lot of SemiCabs traction has been in India and many U.S. market participants discount overseas execution even when the customers are large and the contracts expand . I see this all the time with microcaps international wins get treated like nice but does it work in the U.S. even when the economics are already meaningful . The Dec 22 2025 recap laid out specific examples that look hard to dismiss . The company reported five new contract wins in 2025 with large FMCG customers in India and six contract expansions with lane and trip volume increases ranging from 100 % to 600 % source type company press release . The biggest datapoint was an Asian Paints expansion cited at $ 6M described as the largest in SemiCab history and it increased active lanes from 25 to 183 . The release also notes Asian Paints has over $ 4B in annual sales which gives context on customer size source type company press release . Management also stated SemiCab ARR increased 220 % from $ 2.5M in January to over $ 8M by December and cited a forwardlooking ARR of $ 15M based on current contracts and expansions source type company press release . If that runrate is being built on expansion behavior in one geography the question becomes whether the same playbook transfers to the U.S. through Apex . Do your own research ."

      "selftext": "Given the ongoing and complex geopolitical situation between the U.S. and Venezuela, particularly regarding sanctions, leadership disputes, and the fluctuating status of oil exports, I am curious how others are positioning their portfolios. Are there specific sectors or companies that stand to benefit from these shifts? I’m particularly interested in whether this creates a long-term play for U.S.-based energy giants (like Chevron), or if there are indirect opportunities in neighboring Latin American markets or global commodities. Furthermore, with the potential for future easing or tightening of sanctions depending on U.S. policy shifts, how are you weighing the risk-to-reward ratio? Is it worth looking into distressed debt, or is the political instability still too high of a barrier? Looking forward to hearing your insights and strategies. Disclaimer: I do not hold any positions in the companies mentioned.",

Are there specific sectors or companies that stand to benefit from these shifts I ’ m particularly interested in whether this creates a longterm play for U.S.based energy giants like Chevron or if there are indirect opportunities in neighboring Latin American markets or global commodities . Furthermore with the potential for future easing or tightening of sanctions depending on U.S. policy shifts how are you weighing the risktoreward ratio Is it worth looking into distressed debt or is the political instability still too high of a barrier Looking forward to hearing your insights and strategies .

Looking closer, the MSCI All Country World ex‑USA index, which tracks global stocks outside the US, returned roughly 29 % in 2025, ahead of the S&P 500’s gain of around 16 %, A weaker US dollar also helped boost the dollar adjusted returns of foreign markets, Asian markets, in particular saw notable strength, with South Korea’s KOSPI surging and tech heavy companie leading the way, European indices also posted solid double digit gains across Spain, Italy, Germany, and the UK.

      "selftext": "{this is a short term play, im not \"investing\" in oil to see how this disaster plays out in 10 years} During the press conference yesterday Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure” *Source:* [Youtube]( Timestamp: 37:25 **1) For those who weren't around in 2007, quick history** In 2007, Hugo Chávez forced foreign oil companies into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures. PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company. Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave. For the US this meant: * ExxonMobil refused. Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated. Years of arbitration followed. * ConocoPhillips refused. Same outcome. Large projects seized. * Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational. *Result*? Production fell from \\~3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd. **2) What a “rebuild” actually looks like** This is not about new mega-projects. It starts with fixing what already exists. Workovers on shut-in wells. Pipeline repairs and leak control. Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders. Restoring export terminals. + Venezuelan crude is extra-heavy. You cannot produce it without services, chemicals, and constant intervention. **3) Who makes money first?** * **Phase 1:** Oilfield services. Short contracts. Fast cash flow. Low political risk. * **Phase 2:** Operators with existing licenses and assets. * **Phase 3:** Majors that demand long-term legal certainty. **Where I put my money** *Phase 1*: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes *Phase 2*: Chevron *Phase 3*: ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil **Doubts:** Isn't this all a bit *premature*? Yes, absolutely, but the stock market doesnt let you wait until it's all said and done. Isn't it *late* already? Maybe, all these companies are already up ±2-10% premarket. But I'd say it's still early. About Phase 3 players I’m unsure how they will react. They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild. I guess they’d be repaid by grants for rebuilding. But I’m unsure. The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd. Maybe one of you guys has better theories. Do with this as you will. I'm in and shared my view. happy to see yours. ⸻ **TL;DR** Trump said: “We are going to be running it \\[Venezuela\\] with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure”. A rebuild starts with repairs, not new oil dreams. Oilfield services get paid first, Chevron benefits next. Exxon and Conoco are optional upside, not the core play. Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but I'm in. My bet is on: Schlumberger, Halliburton, Baker Hughes and Chevron for now.",

PDVSA is the Venezuelan state oil company . Foreign operators were told to hand over majority ownership or leave . For the US this meant ExxonMobil refused . Assets in the Orinoco Belt were expropriated . Years of arbitration followed . ConocoPhillips refused . Same outcome . Large projects seized . Chevron accepted minority stakes and stayed operational . Result Production fell from 3.2 mbd to well below 1 mbd . 2 What a “ rebuild ” actually looks like This is not_about new megaprojects . It starts with fixing what already exists . Workovers on shutin wells . Pipeline repairs and leak control . Stabilizing heavy crude upgraders . Restoring export terminals . Venezuelan crude is extraheavy . You can not produce it without services chemicals and constant intervention . 3 Who makes money first Phase 1 Oilfield services . Short contracts . Fast cash flow . Low political risk . Phase 2 Operators with existing licenses and assets . Phase 3 Majors that demand longterm legal certainty . Where I put my money Phase 1 Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes Phase 2 Chevron Phase 3 ConocoPhillips ExxonMobil Doubts Isnt this all a bit premature Yes absolutely but the stock market doesnt let you wait until its all said and done . Isnt it late already Maybe all these companies are already up ±210 % premarket . But Id say its still early . About Phase 3 players I ’ m unsure how they will react . They will want their settlements but I doubt Trump will give them any without joining the rebuild . I guess they ’ d be repaid by grants for rebuilding . But I ’ m unsure . The uncertainty is why I put them 3rd . Maybe one of you guys has better theories . Do with this as you will . Im in and shared my view . happy to see yours . ⸻ TLDR Trump said “ We are going to be running it Venezuela with a group … we are going to rebuild the oil infrastructure ” . A rebuild starts with repairs not_new oil dreams . Oilfield services get paid first Chevron benefits next . Exxon and Conoco are optional upside not_the core play . Might be too early to call or too late already according to premarket but Im in . My bet is on Schlumberger Halliburton Baker Hughes and Chevron for now ."

Market cap: \\~$64B Revenue: $7.6B (up 17.5% vs last year) Adjusted EPS: $3.33 52-week high: \\~$469 52-week low: \\~$227 The risks... It’s not cheap. You’re paying a premium for that growth. If the AI hype cools, the stock does too. Weather delays projects. Regulations slow things down. Bottom line... The AI boom is real. But it hits a wall without power. Quanta is the sledgehammer breaking down that wall. As long as data centers need juice, Quanta has work to do. Anyone else keeping an eye on this one and why? Dan from Money Machine Newsletter",

Microsoft - 9$ 6. Visa - 9$ 7. Palantir - 8$ 8.Microstrategy - 5$ 9. Nividia - 5$ 10. ASML - 5$ 11. VTI - 5$ 12. CIBR - 5$ 13. Cash - 12$ Total allocated weekly 113$ with 12$ cash reserve (roughly 10%) I had to pause my contributions over the summer as I was saving for equipment I needed for school. With that pause I had 2,750$ left over for the 2025 fiscal year. I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row! Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year. My plan is listed below: I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2,750 total “extra” contributions 250$ cash reserve 2,500$ stocks 2,500 / 26 =96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1. Tesla 2. SCHG 3. Microsoft 4. Microstrategy 5. VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money? I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion. Personally with those 5 plays I would add (EXTRA) 1. 25$ to Tesla 2. 20$ to SCHG 3. 20$ to Microsoft 4. 15$ to Microstrategy 5. 16$ to VTI Or something like that. What’s the move chat?",

With that pause I had 2750 $ left over for the 2025 fiscal year . I have already caught back up and contributed that money to my Roth making it the 2nd time I maxed it out in a row Super pumped but now I have questions as to how I will bleed this extra money into the market while still contributing my automatic buys for 2026 fiscal year . My plan is listed below I want to bleed extra money into the market over a span of 6 months or 26 weeks 2750 total “ extra ” contributions 250 $ cash reserve 2500 $ stocks 2500 26 96.154 extra a week I have to allocate My top conviction plays in my opinion are 1 . Tesla 2 . SCHG 3 . Microsoft 4 . Microstrategy 5 . VTI My question is how I should allocate the extra money I have an idea of splitting it between the 5 companies but want an outsiders opinion . Personally with those 5 plays I would add EXTRA 1 . 25 $ to Tesla 2 . 20 $ to SCHG 3 . 20 $ to Microsoft 4 . 15 $ to Microstrategy 5 . 16 $ to VTI Or something like that . What ’ s the move chat"

I know that it's normal to have periods of growth and periods of decline and periods of stagnation but gosh every time that I get stuck in decline or stagnation I get frustrated. My net worth has stayed the same basically since September due to the volatility. I am still 70 K away from the last high that I reached in September or October I think? before all the volatility started. I know it will move again but just frustrated and can't wait for it to start growing again. Anyone with a lot of years in the market who has been through this before? 2022 was the last period like this but it was more of a decline than stagnation I think. I remember being equally as frustrated I wish I saw the light at the end of the tunnel.",

I know that its normal to have periods of growth and periods of decline and periods of stagnation but gosh every time that I get stuck in decline or stagnation I get frustrated . My net worth has stayed the same basically since September due to the volatility . I am still 70 K away from the last high that I reached in September or October I think before all the volatility started . I know it will move again but just frustrated and cant wait for it to start growing again . Anyone with a lot of years in the market who has been through this before 2022 was the last period like this but it was more of a decline than stagnation I think . I remember being equally as frustrated I wish I saw the light at the end of the tunnel ."

      "selftext": "The year was 2015. I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school. The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers. I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k. I remember buying Macys, Hecla Mining, and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better. I was over trading like a mad man. This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7$ per trade during those days. Just young and dumb not really making any money. Wasting company time so no harm no foul. In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k. Which was basically my life savings at that point in time. I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres (tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per) During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia. Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes. A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary (yes even at that time). I found his aspirations of self driving, AI , robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape. I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk. I remember talking to my father in law about it. “What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia?” Too many eggs in one basket was his response. I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia. As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could. $200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares. It has been a great ride since then. There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares. It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long. So much bullshit -Crypto winter , Andrew Left short selling attacks, Covid selloffs, deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day. I’m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house, cars, investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA. Trading and more specifically, Nvidia, changed my entire life. Proudly riding with Jensen",

      "selftext_processed": "The year was 2015 . I was working a shit job as a housing consultant at a for profit automotive school . The job sucked but I had plenty of desk time and I used it to research tickers . I had been trading off an on since around 2010 but with only about 1k . I remember buying Macys Hecla Mining and bullshit penny stocks until I knew better . I was over trading like a mad man . This was even dumber then because they charged commission of about 7 $ per trade during those days . Just young and dumb not_really making any money . Wasting company time so no_harm no_foul . In the beginning of 2015 I received an inheritance from an Aunt for 10k . Which was basically my life savings at that point in time . I could have very easily put this money up my nose but I was intrigued by investing after reading an article about Teslanairres tsla investors who had made life changing money off shares that iPod around 20 bucks per During my many hours of researching companies I came across Nvidia . Here was a legacy gaming company that had exposure to many futuristic themes . A CEO that had been there since inception and came across as visionary yes even at that time . I found his aspirations of self driving AI robotics and iot to be very disruptive compared to the current 2015 technology landscape . I began watching his interviews and was particularly interested with an early sit down with Elon Musk . I remember talking to my father in law about it . “ What if I just plop the whole 10k down on Nvidia ” Too many eggs in one basket was his response . I ended up saying fuggit and doing it my way and in October 2015 I dropped the whole 10k into Nvidia . As I watched Nvidias ascent I realized I had found something on the ground floor an added to my position whenever I could . $ 200 every other paycheck until I got up to 500shares . It has been a great ride since then . There have been ups and downs and moments of insane volatility that almost spooked me out of my shares . It definitely wasnt a straight arrow up and it took balls of steel to hold this long . So much bullshit Crypto winter Andrew Left short selling attacks Covid selloffs deepseek bullshit and most recently liberation day . I ’ m glad to say I stayed the course and only trimmed after massive runs and splits using the money to buy my house cars investment properties and drop the rest in a HYSA . Trading and more specifically Nvidia changed my entire life . Proudly riding with Jensen"

      "title": "[UPDATE] $GT Goodyear Tires: Maduro's Capture Stock Analysis",
      "selftext": "[**Initial DD here**]( ***Note:*** *I've been away on vacation so not much time for new full DDs yet. As to my previous post, I'll be researching and writing up on PayPal (most upvotes). As of now, PYPL is not a long, I am looking into whether its a short or a hold, more information to come.* ==================================================================== We recently got news of Maduro's capture by the US, and this is very economically important, and it's extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market. **Background:** *Note: Use of AI to research & write the sanction background summary. (Reviewed by me)* **2018** * The Trump administration **expanded financial sanctions** on Venezuela. * New executive orders **banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt** and blocked dealings with Venezuela’s **state-issued digital currency (the “petro”)**. * Goal: **cut off new financing** to Nicolás Maduro’s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally. **2019** * January\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA, Venezuela’s state oil company, effectively **blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil** and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. * August\\*\\*:\\*\\* The U.S. **froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States** and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro. * Impact: Venezuela’s **oil exports and government revenues collapsed**, making 2019 the most severe sanctions year. ==================================================================== **Goodyear Tires ($GT) Update:** **December 10, 2018:** Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions. They locked the gates and laid off the workforce. (1,160 employees) **December 11, 2018 (The Seizure):** The Maduro regime declared Goodyear's closure \"illegal\" and an act of \"sabotage.\" The government invoked labor laws to immediately \"occupy\" and take control of the facility in Valencia, promising to restart production under state management. In a famous detail from the 2018 exit, Goodyear gave each laid-off employee **10 tires** as part of their severance package because the currency (Bolívar) was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money. *(AI)* If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant, Goodyear gains a fully-constructed industrial facility. Even if it requires $100M in refurbishment, reclaiming a facility with a value of \\~$500M+ is a huge gain for Goodyear, so I'll try to quantify this the best I can. Before the complete economic collapse, Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America. We can look at 2014-2015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain. * In 2014, despite early signs of crisis, Goodyear Venezuela generated **$119 million in Operating Income**. * In 2015, Venezuela accounted for **33% of Latin America’s net sales that year,** up from 16% in 2014, despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession. * At the time of the 2018 seizure, union leaders reported the plant was producing **10,500 tires per day** while running at only **20% capacity**. * This implies a full capacity of 52,500 tires/day or 19m tires/yr (LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013) Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream, particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime, would represent a massive gain for Goodyear’s current shareholders. **The Valencia Plant** On September 16, 2025, the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million (approximately $32 million) to \"reactivate and modernize\" the Valencia plant. This investment was directed toward: 1. Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems. 2. Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle state-of-the-art machinery. 3. Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards. 4. Modernization of curing and extrusion set-points to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs. It is likely focused on the most critical failure points, curing presses and Banbury mixers. If this plant was worth \\~$USD600m in 2018, it was state-of-the art at the time, ill conservatively (see note below) estimate \\~200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013's demand alone. The capital saved by not having to build a greenfield site (a process that would take 24–36 months) allows Goodyear to quickly capture the post-war demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction. *Note: Honestly, I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investments/projects from $GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7-Year old factory into what is needed for $GT's tires. Unfortunately, I'm writing this up on a Sunday and that'd probably take more time than I'm willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence.* **Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs** Raw material costs typically account for 60% of total production expenses, while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20%. The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowest-cost producers in Goodyear’s global portfolio. Goodyear’s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A., a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70,000 metric tons per year. Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures, and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis, continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19, 2025. The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia. The Trump administration’s stated goal is to \"get the oil flowing\" by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country’s broken infrastructure. This revival of the domestic petroleum industry, which has seen production stagnate at around 800,000–900,000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million+, will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and high-temperature polymers used in tire tread inserts. The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized, reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant. Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energy-intensive. The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela’s power. While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect, the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts. A stable, low-cost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossil-fuel-based electricity or unreliable grids. **There are several demand drivers that I'm happy to further discuss if not obvious that will fuel a catch-up phase in Venezuela and LATAM** If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $119 million on only partial capacity, a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $250 million to $300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028. **TLDR:** A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $GT and completes the initial thesis. As this continues to develop, we may see incremental $USD250-300mm gain in operating income within 2 years.",

      "selftext_processed": "Initial DD here Note Ive been away on vacation so not_much time for new full DDs yet . As to my previous post Ill be researching and writing up on PayPal most upvotes . As of now PYPL is not_a long I am looking into whether its a short or a hold more information to come . We recently got news of Maduros capture by the US and this is very economically important and its extremely important to analyze the effects of these events on holdings and other areas of the market . Background Note Use of AI to research write the sanction background summary . Reviewed by me 2018 The Trump administration expanded financial sanctions on Venezuela . New executive orders banned transactions involving Venezuelan government debt and blocked dealings with Venezuela ’ s stateissued digital currency the “ petro ” . Goal cut off new financing to Nicolás Maduro ’ s government and limit its ability to raise money internationally . 2019 January The U.S. sanctioned PDVSA Venezuela ’ s state oil company effectively blocking U.S. companies from buying Venezuelan oil and freezing PDVSA assets in the U.S. August The U.S. froze all Venezuelan government assets in the United States and threatened sanctions on foreign entities that supported Maduro . Impact Venezuela ’ s oil exports and government revenues collapsed making 2019 the most severe sanctions year . Goodyear Tires $ GT Update December 10 2018 Goodyear formally announced it was halting operations in Venezuela due to economic conditions and U.S. sanctions . They locked the gates and laid off the workforce . 1160 employees December 11 2018 The Seizure The Maduro regime declared Goodyears closure illegal and an act of sabotage . The government invoked labor laws to immediately occupy and take control of the facility in Valencia promising to restart production under state management . In a famous detail from the 2018 exit Goodyear gave each laidoff employee 10 tires as part of their severance package because the currency Bolívar was so worthless that tires were a more stable store of value than money . AI If the new U.S. backed transition government returns the plant Goodyear gains a fullyconstructed industrial facility . Even if it requires $ 100M in refurbishment reclaiming a facility with a value of $ 500M is a huge gain for Goodyear so Ill try to quantify this the best I can . Before the complete economic collapse Venezuela was a massive profit driver for Goodyear Latin America . We can look at 20142015 financial filings to quantify exactly what GT lost and what it could regain . In 2014 despite early signs of crisis Goodyear Venezuela generated $ 119 million in Operating Income . In 2015 Venezuela accounted for 33 % of Latin America ’ s net sales that year up from 16 % in 2014 despite the broader regional sales decline caused by the Brazilian recession . At the time of the 2018 seizure union leaders reported the plant was producing 10500 tires per day while running at only 20 % capacity . This implies a full capacity of 52500 tiresday or 19m tiresyr LATAM sales volume of 18m in 2013 Its pretty clear that the restoration of this revenue stream particularly under a stabilized currency or dollarized administrative regime would represent a massive gain for Goodyear ’ s current shareholders . The Valencia Plant On September 16 2025 the Venezuelan Ministry of Industries announced a strategic partnership with international investors to allocate over €30 million approximately $ 32 million to reactivate and modernize the Valencia plant . This investment was directed toward 1 . Technological upgrades and restoration of production lines to replace aging legacy systems . 2 . Training the workforce in coordination with labor unions to handle stateoftheart machinery . 3 . Implementing advanced technology to ensure that tires produced at the site meet global quality and durability standards . 4 . Modernization of curing and extrusion setpoints to improve energy efficiency and reduce conversion costs . It is likely focused on the most critical failure points curing presses and Banbury mixers . If this plant was worth $ USD600m in 2018 it was stateofthe art at the time ill conservatively see note below estimate 200mm in CapEx to reinstate this immense factory that can produce all of 2013s demand alone . The capital saved by not_having to build a greenfield site a process that would take 24–36 months allows Goodyear to quickly capture the postwar demand surge while advancing the Goodyear Forward goal of debt reduction . Note Honestly I could research further into this and get exact numbers by comparing precedent factory investmentsprojects from $ GT and competitors to try and estimate how much investment would be needed to return this 7Year old factory into what is needed for $ GTs tires . Unfortunately Im writing this up on a Sunday and thatd probably take more time than Im willing to put in for a marginal gain in thesis confidence . Venezuelan Supply for Tire inputs Raw material costs typically account for 60 % of total production expenses while energy consumption during the vulcanization and curing cycles adds another 15–20 % . The Venezuelan industrial corridor offers several unique advantages that could make the Valencia plant one of the lowestcost producers in Goodyear ’ s global portfolio . Goodyear ’ s Valencia plant is located in close proximity to Negroven S.A. a carbon black producer with an installed capacity of 70000 metric tons per year . Carbon black is a critical reinforcing filler in rubber mixtures and Negroven has remained operational throughout the crisis continuing to export to international markets as recently as December 19 2025 . The availability of local carbon black eliminates significant logistics costs and import duties that affect other regional plants in Brazil or Colombia . The Trump administration ’ s stated goal is to get the oil flowing by deploying major U.S. oil companies to fix the country ’ s broken infrastructure . This revival of the domestic petroleum industry which has seen production stagnate at around 800000–900000 barrels per day despite a potential for 2 million will provide Goodyear with a direct source of petrochemicals required for synthetic rubber and hightemperature polymers used in tire tread inserts . The involvement of Chevron and other majors ensures that the processing facilities will be modernized reducing the volatility of chemical feedstocks for the Valencia Plant . Tire manufacturing is exceptionally energyintensive . The Guri Dam hydroelectric system provides the vast majority of Venezuela ’ s power . While the system has faced threats of sabotage and neglect the Transition Governing Council has identified the securement and establishment of technical oversight for the Guri Dam as an immediate priority to prevent total electrical blackouts . A stable lowcost hydroelectric power source would give the Valencia plant a significant competitive advantage over plants in other emerging markets that rely on expensive fossilfuelbased electricity or unreliable grids . There are several demand drivers that Im happy to further discuss if not_obvious that will fuel a catchup phase in Venezuela and LATAM If the plant achieves its 2015 operating income of $ 119 million on only partial capacity a fully utilized facility in a stable currency environment could realistically contribute $ 250 million to $ 300 million in annual segment operating income by 2028 . TLDR A U.S. overhaul of Venezuela is EXTREMELY bullish for $ GT and completes the initial thesis . As this continues to develop we may see incremental $ USD250300mm gain in operating income within 2 years ."

      "selftext": "I’m 20, not a trader, and I don’t have much experience in the market. I have about $15k invested total and I’m thinking about putting around 30% of it into a high-risk idea. I want honest opinions, not hype. My thinking is this: Venezuela has huge oil reserves, and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses, their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding. That wouldn’t be fast, but eventually someone has to do the work. Instead of betting on Venezuela directly, I’m looking at companies around it: – Chevron (CVX) since they’re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB, HAL, BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO, MPC, PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I’m unsure about and want feedback on: – Is this already priced in and I’m late to the idea? – If this ever happens, are we talking months or years before it matters? – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions, corruption, or not getting paid? – If you were making a small speculative bet like this, would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely? – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on? I’m not trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything. I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head. Any honest opinions appreciated",

I have about $ 15k invested total and I ’ m thinking about putting around 30 % of it into a highrisk idea . I want honest opinions not_hype . My thinking is this Venezuela has huge oil reserves and if the U.S. ever seriously eases sanctions or expands licenses their oil industry would need a lot of rebuilding . That wouldn ’ t be fast but eventually someone has to do the work . Instead of betting on Venezuela directly I ’ m looking at companies around it – Chevron CVX since they ’ re already involved there – Oilfield service companies like SLB HAL BKR if rebuilding actually starts – Gulf Coast refiners like VLO MPC PSX that can handle heavy crude if Venezuelan oil comes back What I ’ m unsure about and want feedback on – Is this already priced in and I ’ m late to the idea – If this ever happens are we talking months or years before it matters – Are oilfield service companies a bad idea here because of sanctions corruption or not_getting paid – If you were making a small speculative bet like this would you focus on one angle or avoid it completely – What would be clear signs that this idea is wrong and I should move on I ’ m not_trying to get rich quick or act like I know everything . I just want to learn how to think about ideas like this without getting attached to a story in my head . Any honest opinions appreciated"

This is better than share lending that happened behind the scenes in the past with no income to the actual share owners; but the greed here is ridiculous.

This year though, I am planning to do something different based on 2 ideas. First idea is that it’s way more beneficial to be invested in something of value that appreciates. Second idea is that energy/infrastructure, robotics, and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets. With that in mind, I plan to split the 2000/month 4 ways; 500 into a Roth IRA (holding VT/SCHG/ROBO/XLU), 500 into HYSA, 500 into QQQI/SLVR, 500 into *something else*. It’s the something else that I have a question about. Below are the stocks I’m considering: Energy/Infra: TAN, GRID, IREN Metals: SILJ, REMX, GLTR. ROBOTICS: ARKQ Moonshots: ETHA, BMNR, IBIT, JD, QXO, SLS, POET, CSIQ, AMPX, TE, ARRY, LAC, PATH. I plan to have a combination of shares/leaps from 2-3 of those. Eventually, want to get into covered calls too. Goal is to grow account and eventually start generating passive income. Any critique, information, or advice is welcomed. I have a pension, 457b, and 30k in crypto. I’m 34 and expecting a child next year.",

This year though I am planning to do something different based on 2 ideas . First idea is that it ’ s way more beneficial to be invested in something of value that appreciates . Second idea is that energyinfrastructure robotics and metals are going to be very important and I want to get into those markets . With that in mind I plan to split the 2000month 4 ways 500 into a Roth IRA holding VTSCHGROBOXLU 500 into HYSA 500 into QQQISLVR 500 into something else . It ’ s the something else that I have a question about . Below are the stocks I ’ m considering EnergyInfra TAN GRID IREN Metals SILJ REMX GLTR . ROBOTICS ARKQ Moonshots ETHA BMNR IBIT JD QXO SLS POET CSIQ AMPX TE ARRY LAC PATH . I plan to have a combination of sharesleaps from 23 of those . Eventually want to get into covered calls too . Goal is to grow account and eventually start generating passive income . Any critique information or advice is welcomed . I have a pension 457b and 30k in crypto . I ’ m 34 and expecting a child next year ."

      "selftext": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a (fledgling) Value Investor. It has been a very interesting ride to say the least, and I feel I've learned a lot over that time. Naturally, there is still a lot more for me to learn. Of course, one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the long-term. It is a question I'm sure we all ask ourselves. I know 5 years is not \"long-term\", however, it's a good checkpoint along the path. So, here are my results against the S&P 500 benchmark (w/dividends included for both) and brief thoughts on what I learned: |Year / Portfolio|My Portfolio|S&P 500^(1)| |:-|:--:|:--:| |2021|15.95%|28.26%| |2022|\\-29.46%|\\-14.99%| |2023|42.86%|21.69%| |2024|43.99%|30.03%| |2025|25.05%|15.45%| |**CAGR**|**16.04%**|**14.78%**| ^(1 - S&P 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars & Data.) 2021: 11 positions EOY. This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first. Mistakes were made... Most, if not All, of them. My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noise/static/garbage, and should not be heavily weighted as \"research\". 2022: Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year. Acquired three new positions (one spin-off). New META position closed $120 with my cost basis was ~$197. The other hurt was MHH; I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop. Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage, but I should have applied to MHH also. Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down w/META, which I should not have applied to MHH. 2023: This year was mainly building on what I already owned. I sold out a very small position in IDN, started in 2021. Bought with no real due diligence, then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled. Sold at a 73% loss. Started with 10 positions. Ended with 10 positions. I don't know that there was huge lesson to '23. I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss, but held a few months longer as a reminder. 2024: I had a bit more movement this year. I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out (MDC). Realized I didn't know enough to hold WAL or MU, which fell outside my circle of competence. Hindsight being 20/20, I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU... Started three new positions. The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions. 9 positions. 2025: I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position. With MHH, I realized there was an emotional attachment, that management was not turning it around, and accepted my thesis was wrong. Took the ~40% loss. I also tested out selling covered calls. Did this with WBD, which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years. Lesson 1 was I'm still human and at times irrational. I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally, such as with MHH. Lesson 2 is that I do not understand options well at all, and I am really not temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding. Lesson 3 was/is a reminder to be patient. I did not find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued. And that is okay! I don't need to swing at any pitches to do well.

      "selftext_processed": "The end of 2025 marks my 5 year anniversary as a fledgling Value Investor . It has been a very interesting ride to say the least and I feel Ive learned a lot over that time . Naturally there is still a lot more for me to learn . Of course one of the most common questions that gets asked of value investing is can we beat the market in the longterm . It is a question Im sure we all ask ourselves . I know 5 years is not_longterm however its a good checkpoint along the path . So here are my results against the SP 500 benchmark wdividends included for both and brief thoughts on what I learned Year PortfolioMy PortfolioSP 5001 202115.95 % 28.26 % 202229.46 % 14.99 % 202342.86 % 21.69 % 202443.99 % 30.03 % 202525.05 % 15.45 % CAGR16.04 % 14.78 % 1 SP 500 data taken from DQYDJ and Of Dollars Data . 2021 11 positions EOY . This was really me figuring out the basics by jumping in feet first . Mistakes were made ... Most if not_All of them . My biggest takeaway in the first year was that most articles on stocks are filled with a lot of noisestaticgarbage and should not_be heavily weighted as research . 2022 Moved out of 4 of positions from end of previous year . Acquired three new positions one spinoff . New META position closed $ 120 with my cost basis was $ 197 . The other hurt was MHH I believed in my thesis enough to ride out the drop . Lesson 1 was letting go of the garbage but I should have applied to MHH also . Lesson 2 was stomaching the ride down wMETA which I should not_have applied to MHH . 2023 This year was mainly building on what I already owned . I sold out a very small position in IDN started in 2021 . Bought with no_real due diligence then kept swallowing sunshine management shoveled . Sold at a 73 % loss . Started with 10 positions . Ended with 10 positions . I dont know that there was huge lesson to 23 . I knew by the end of 2022 that IDN was a loss but held a few months longer as a reminder . 2024 I had a bit more movement this year . I sold 3 positions and had one position get bought out MDC . Realized I didnt know enough to hold WAL or MU which fell outside my circle of competence . Hindsight being 2020 I do wish I would have felt inclined to learn more about MU ... Started three new positions . The lesson learned was it is okay to sell weak conviction positions to buy other stronger conviction positions . 9 positions . 2025 I finally closed out MHH early in the year and one other position . With MHH I realized there was an emotional attachment that management was not_turning it around and accepted my thesis was wrong . Took the 40 % loss . I also tested out selling covered calls . Did this with WBD which I acquired in 2022 and built up in subsequent years . Lesson 1 was Im still human and at times irrational . I need to be more critical in my analysis of where I might be behaving irrationally such as with MHH . Lesson 2 is that I do not_understand options well at all and I am really not_temperamentally suited for them with my current lack of understanding . Lesson 3 wasis a reminder to be patient . I did not_find anything in 2025 that I felt I could understand and that was undervalued . And that is okay I dont need to swing at any pitches to do well . cross post full text from Value Investing sub"

      "title": "The Venezuela lesson: invest in energy security NOT cheap supply - The incoming commodity bull run (uranium, rare earths, precious metals).",
      "selftext": "My investment thesis is straightforward: over the next decade, markets will increasingly reward secure, politically aligned supply chains, not simply the lowest-cost producers. Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy, and when that happens, pricing, capital flows, and valuations change structurally. That’s why I’m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Western-aligned supply chains. My core holdings are Energy Fuels (UUUU), Cameco (CCJ), Centrus Energy (LEU), MP Materials (MP), and Lynas (LYSDY). $300k USD invested. I chose these US/US allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities cannot easily replace. Together, they cover uranium mining, nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment, and rare earth production and processing outside of China. China controls the majority of these rare earths and, following Venezeula, supply restrictions are only going to get worse. We’re in the hoarding era…. The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story, but I think that framing misses the larger signal. Whether oil supply increases or not is secondary. The more important takeaway is geopolitical: the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved. That reinforces a world where energy, materials, and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than free-market commodities. Importantly, Venezuela does not pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths. These markets are nothing like oil. Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through long-term contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance. Rare earths require not just mining, but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop. There is no mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market. History supports this view. During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run, prices did not rise because of speculative demand alone. They rose because utilities realized they were under-contracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure long-term supply. Once utilities began competing for material, prices moved violently and quickly, and equities re-rated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated. Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was. I expect a very similar situation to take place between 2026-2028. After Venezuela, the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Sky-rocket. Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren’t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises. When utilities and governments fear supply disruption, they don’t negotiate for the best price; they secure supply at almost any price. That historical lesson matters today. Nuclear power is expanding globally, enrichment capacity is constrained, and non-China rare earth supply remains limited. At the same time, geopolitical risk is rising, not falling. If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be risk-off across all assets. But the second-order effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy, subsidies, and long-term contracts favoring Western-aligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials. I’m not positioned for a short-term commodity spike. I’m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost, just as they did in prior cycles. In those environments, uranium and rare earth equities don’t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure. That’s the bet. TLDR: Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets; history shows these markets don’t reprice gradually - they reprice violently when supply security is questioned. Edit: TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY. MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY!!!",

      "selftext_processed": "My investment thesis is straightforward over the next decade markets will increasingly reward secure politically aligned supply chains not_simply the lowestcost producers . Energy security and strategic materials are becoming matters of national policy and when that happens pricing capital flows and valuations change structurally . That ’ s why I ’ m concentrated in uranium and rare earth companies that sit outside China and inside Westernaligned supply chains . My core holdings are Energy Fuels UUUU Cameco CCJ Centrus Energy LEU MP Materials MP and Lynas LYSDY . $ 300k USD invested . I chose these USUS allied companies because they represent critical choke points in supply chains that the United States and the West utilities can not easily replace . Together they cover uranium mining nuclear fuel conversion and enrichment and rare earth production and processing outside of China . China controls the majority of these rare earths and following Venezeula supply restrictions are only going to get worse . We ’ re in the hoarding era… . The recent events in Venezuela are mostly being discussed as an oil story but I think that framing misses the larger signal . Whether oil supply increases or not_is secondary . The more important takeaway is geopolitical the United States has shown it is willing to act decisively when strategic interests are involved . That reinforces a world where energy materials and supply chains are increasingly treated as matters of security rather than freemarket commodities . Importantly Venezuela does not_pose an oversupply risk to uranium or rare earths . These markets are nothing_like oil . Uranium is heavily regulated and sold primarily through longterm contracts with utilities that plan fuel needs years in advance . Rare earths require not_just mining but complex processing infrastructure that takes a decade or more to develop . There is no_mechanism for sudden supply flooding in either market . History supports this view . During the 2006–2007 uranium bull run prices did not_rise because of speculative demand alone . They rose because utilities realized they were undercontracted in a tightening market and rushed to secure longterm supply . Once utilities began competing for material prices moved violently and quickly and equities rerated far beyond what traditional valuation models anticipated . Rare earths experienced a similar dynamic a few years later when export controls and geopolitical tension exposed how fragile global supply really was . I expect a very similar situation to take place between 20262028 . After Venezuela the last thing China will do is flood the market with their supply leading to a supply constraint that will enable rare earths and uranium to Skyrocket . Just look at how commodities reacted yesterday… Those episodes weren ’ t driven by economic growth cycles — they were driven by procurement crises . When utilities and governments fear supply disruption they don ’ t negotiate for the best price they secure supply at almost any price . That historical lesson matters today . Nuclear power is expanding globally enrichment capacity is constrained and nonChina rare earth supply remains limited . At the same time geopolitical risk is rising not_falling . If tensions escalate further — particularly around Taiwan — the immediate market reaction would likely be riskoff across all assets . But the secondorder effect would be a rapid acceleration of industrial policy subsidies and longterm contracts favoring Westernaligned suppliers of uranium and strategic materials . I ’ m not_positioned for a shortterm commodity spike . I ’ m positioned for a world where governments and utilities prioritize certainty of supply over cost just as they did in prior cycles . In those environments uranium and rare earth equities don ’ t behave like normal commodities — they behave like strategic infrastructure . That ’ s the bet . TLDR Geopolitical fragmentation turns uranium and rare earths into strategic assets history shows these markets don ’ t reprice gradually they reprice violently when supply security is questioned . Edit TRUMP on LIVE NATIONAL TELEVISION JUST ANNOUNCED THEY ARE RUNNING THE COUNTRY . MOTHERFUCKING COMMODITY SEASON BABY"

      "title": "BYD +5% after becoming world’s top EV seller with 2.26M units as Tesla deliveries fall 8.6% in 2025",
      "selftext": "Source: [ >In 2011, Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor. But some 14 years later, BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game. >The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest seller of EVs, according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week. >BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs, up nearly 28% from 2024. Meanwhile, Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales: Deliveries fell 8.6% to only 1.6 million, recording the biggest annual drop in the company’s history. >BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not available for purchase in America, while China is Tesla’s second-largest market. >In the fourth quarter, Tesla’s sales came in at about 418,000, down 15.6% from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter, when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $7,500 tax credit expired on October 1. >Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not report its sales by market, providing only global figures, but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue, according to company reports. Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025. >Tesla’s deliveries had grown nearly 50% a year at one point. But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024, posting a modest 1% decline. Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers, such a BYD and legacy global automakers, as well as backlash against Musk’s political activities, which angered many potential American and European buyers. >Early in the year, when Musk was leading the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency, there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States, and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites. >The rush to take advantage of the soon-to-expire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter. But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year. >To try to counter the loss of the tax credit, Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars, but those versions, while costing about $5,000 less than their “premium” equivalents, also won’t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features. >Aggressive competition >BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market. The intense \\_\\_ in China has prompted the Shenzhen-based company to expand further overseas, though its low-price strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets. >Growth in BYD’s overall sales, including EVs and hybrids, slowed to its weakest pace in five years, with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company’s struggles in China, the world’s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars. >BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025. >While China’s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years, competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers, according to HSBC’s research. Rivals like Geely, China’s second-largest EV maker, fast-rising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi, which debuted its first EV only in 2024, have gradually eroded BYD’s domestic market share. >From a peak of 35% in 2023, BYD’s market share fell to 29% in the first 11 months of 2025, according to China Passenger Car Association. In the same period last year, its sales declined more than 5%, while Geely’s surged nearly 90%. >Wang Chuanfu, BYD’s founder and CEO, attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD’s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting, according to state-run media. But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies. >Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose 1.2% in early trading Friday. Shares closed 2025 up 18.6% for the year, as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk’s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “army” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon. But so far the rollout of Tesla’s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises, limited to two metropolitan areas, Austin, Texas, and San Francisco, rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year’s end",

      "selftext_processed": "Source In 2011 Tesla CEO Elon Musk dismissed Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD as a competitor . But some 14 years later BYD beat the American EV pioneer at its own game . The Chinese car giant has overtaken Tesla as the world ’ s largest seller of EVs according to 2025 data released by the two rivals this week . BYD announced Thursday that it had sold 2.26 million EVs up nearly 28 % from 2024 . Meanwhile Tesla reported Friday a second straight year of declining sales Deliveries fell 8.6 % to only 1.6 million recording the biggest annual drop in the company ’ s history . BYD was able to overtake Tesla even though its EVs are not_available for purchase in America while China is Tesla ’ s secondlargest market . In the fourth quarter Tesla ’ s sales came in at about 418000 down 15.6 % from a year earlier and an even sharper decline from record global sales in the third quarter when American motorists were rushing to buy EVs before a $ 7500 tax credit expired on October 1 . Unlike other automakers Tesla does not_report its sales by market providing only global figures but the US market is responsible for nearly half its revenue according to company reports . Reports by other automakers Monday are also likely to show weak US EV sales in the final three months of 2025 . Tesla ’ s deliveries had grown nearly 50 % a year at one point . But it reported its first drop in annual sales in 2024 posting a modest 1 % decline . Its sales fell sharply in the first six months of 2025 as it faced more competition from the EV offerings of other automakers such a BYD and legacy global automakers as well as backlash against Musk ’ s political activities which angered many potential American and European buyers . Early in the year when Musk was leading the Trump administration ’ s Department of Government Efficiency there were regular protests outside Tesla showrooms in Europe and the United States and some reports of vandalism against Tesla cars and sites . The rush to take advantage of the soontoexpire tax credit helped sales in the third quarter . But it likely brought forward purchases by some buyers who might have bought Teslas later in the year . To try to counter the loss of the tax credit Tesla rolled out cheaper versions of its Model 3 and Model Y cars but those versions while costing about $ 5000 less than their “ premium ” equivalents also won ’ t travel as far on a full charge as the premium versions and lack some features . Aggressive competition BYD achieved the latest milestone while grappling with fierce competition and relentless price wars in its home market . The intense __ in China has prompted the Shenzhenbased company to expand further overseas though its lowprice strategy has drawn scrutiny and led to new tariffs in some markets . Growth in BYD ’ s overall sales including EVs and hybrids slowed to its weakest pace in five years with more than 4.6 million vehicles sold last year – underscoring the company ’ s struggles in China the world ’ s largest automobile market and where BYD sells the bulk of its cars . BYD also reported profit declines for both the second and third quarters of 2025 . While China ’ s auto market has become less crowded in the past few years competition remains stiff with around 150 car brands and more than 50 EV makers according to HSBC ’ s research . Rivals like Geely China ’ s secondlargest EV maker fastrising competitor Leapmotor and latecomer Xiaomi which debuted its first EV only in 2024 have gradually eroded BYD ’ s domestic market share . From a peak of 35 % in 2023 BYD ’ s market share fell to 29 % in the first 11 months of 2025 according to China Passenger Car Association . In the same period last year its sales declined more than 5 % while Geely ’ s surged nearly 90 % . Wang Chuanfu BYD ’ s founder and CEO attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to erosion of BYD ’ s technological lead and insufficient product differentiation at a December investor meeting according to staterun media . But he added that the company would soon unveil new technologies . Shares of Tesla TSLA rose 1.2 % in early trading Friday . Shares closed 2025 up 18.6 % for the year as investors looked past weak sales and focused on Musk ’ s plans for a fleet of robotaxis and an “ army ” of humanoid robots that he has promised to start building soon . But so far the rollout of Tesla ’ s robotaxi service has fallen well short of his promises limited to two metropolitan areas Austin Texas and San Francisco rather than serving half of the US population as he had predicted it would by the year ’ s end"

Forbes Article on Meta Fewer users should limit the reach of advertisers which in turn should reduce the ability to maximize the price per ad . Wont this also negatively affect the sale of the RayBan AI glasses since one needs a Meta account to fully use all features If the user accounts are disabled why would one purchase their glasses"

I bought 3 call contracts on Micron that were 7 months out till expiration right before earnings and I happened to be correct about the company's performance. Not exactly an earnings play, I was actually planning to hold these longer, but especially after Micron's huge gains today, I couldn't help but want to secure my profits first before thinking about what to do next. I'm currently thinking maybe I'll buy ATM call options 6 months out on WDC, which is another company in a similar situation as Micron anyways tbh, and then hodl those for the next 3 months and see where this goes.",

Yes, lots of people had better returns in 2025. I’m trying to thread the needle of aggressive returns with sizable hedges. With the market going up for 8 months straight, my hedges hurt quite a bit. But should a black swan event have occurred, or the market switched to bear mode, I would have done pretty well (especially compared to the market). Here’s to 2026 being a good one as well!",

      "selftext": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick. I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing happened... The problem? Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it won't speed up its effects. You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached L-lysine (amino acid) that breaks off in your body using enzymes... thus creating this slow-release mechanism. I wasn't discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin, crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me \"the edge\". [The delivery process]( I instantly got hit with \"Writers euphoria\", some people say they see colors, all I saw was a pump'n'dump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump. Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open. **If you haven't figured it out yet, I'm talking about SLS.** I will attack this pump'n'dump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this **'short'** trip. # Buckle up buckeroos, we're gonna start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt. cap close to USD 600M. First thing that I ask is who is the customer? It's a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 1-2 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer: Acute Myleoid Leukemia. If we look at how many people get it globally we're gonna arrive at roughly: 1.5-2.0 persons / 100.000 Now let's look at all cancers (this will be important): ± 200 people / 100.000 **.... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN.** ( What I didn't realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream, I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being.) \\----- Why am I mentioning all cancers? Well it's to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pump'n'dump posts: That this is a replacement for **Keytruda** (which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80% gross margins). But here's the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts: Keytruda is all-purpose, while the shit that SLS is producing **is NOT**. You need to be tested for the presence of WT-1 antigen which is only done for blood disorders/cancers. You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing about it being usable for this (source: I know a few doctors). This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100... SLS drugs will barely target 1% of that. Why do I say barely? Well because that these drugs are given to specific people... CDK-9 is effective only for people with a certain (less common) mutation and GPS is given (to my understanding) to people in remission. So let's do simple math (before I make you even more depressed): USD 25B ---> 1% ---> 250M (let's be optimistic and say that 80% are eligible) --> 200M But wait it gets better... however right now my heart is pumping, pupils are needle-point sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk... **low doses of ketamine.** [Unlocking my full potential]( Keytruda gets administered constantly, unlike GPS which is like <20 injections. So that 200M you were looking at? Yea it's probably way lower. Now that we've got over the \"HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS\" let's focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEO's marketing/dilution pattern. # A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter. If you've ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE. 1. The technical guy who actually knows shit 2. The bullshitter who's liked, but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if he's career driven will become a good CTO. The second one will become CEO. This is true for every profession, reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell, especially bullshit, to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity. It's all a zero-sum game. Nobody wins, especially not the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like white-monkeys are in China. The CEO SLS is no different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter. How do you become a master bullshitter? Ambiguity. Think of the (1) technical guy, he will always be precise in his formulations, because he knows what he's talking about. the (2) bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart. The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news, carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members (read bagholders and MLM leaders) parrot the \"actual\" but not-factual message to the masses. Just look up the recent posts on bagholder/p'n'd subreddits for SLS. It's all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team. After the share price jumps high, the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion, not including the perpetual warrant inducement plan (which alone makes acquisition very unlikely). The best part? The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50% shareholders want to lower his above-standard pay. And there's a good reason he's getting such high cash bonuses - he knows it's all bullshit. All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired (which is unlikely) it will be sold at a discount and not a premium. Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $4 a share... with constantly increasing share count it's amplifying the speed at which the company's valuation grows even though they still haven't really presented anything substantial. # Let's Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $4? Results of the REGAL study were postponed, which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of: \"We're still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study.\" Which is absolutely hilarious. Because it doesn't say anything about SLS specifically, yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one (it may be, but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant) The study includes both BAT (best available treatment) and the SLS drugs. The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones, while the SLS patients have already died (grim I know). Their argument: Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever they're saying. So why do people think it's \"good news\" for SLS? Because people think they understand statistics when they actually don't. Heck I studied it, specialized in it as a mathematician... and even I will never dare to say that I fully understand statistics. Reality is that the delay might be negative, neutral or positive. **WHY?:** * Many factors come into patient selection - The study isn't the typical \"let's pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests\" they come in different cohorts/groups * You have high odds of selecting the \"good group\" that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment (this can be 10-15%) * All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should (which is a very misleading statistic, and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people)... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years -> and that will average out, so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not enough to know if there is a statistical significance. Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit, because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer, but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis. * A small sample size like this is prone to distortions, follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not, which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn. **But most importantly:** * BAT for AML has significantly improved... and by significantly I mean really significantly. The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 10-12 months. Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS. # Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production. Given their current free cash, it's more than likely that they will need to raise more money. # So Why Are You Bearish? Well I like to think of it in terms of probability / uncertainty, specifically conditional probability. (Let's denote P(event | A ) as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening) Asks yourself this, which probability is higher?: (1) P( Good News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) (2) P( Bad News | CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad ) Which is more likely to be true? (1) > (2) or (1) < (2)? I'm gonna go with the likelihood of bad news as probable... This doesn't mean that the drug won't work, I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections won't be as high as the current valuation. The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs, is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their life-saving medication out there... This isn't the \"age of biotech\" (un)fortunately. Hence I'm buying puts. **NOTE:** I'm not a biochemist, I might be wrong and I'm betting only money that I'm willing to lose, so don't follow blindly, do your own DD. Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots. One last thing... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement. **My position is small, because I'm locked down in other trades, sharing mostly because I like to do equity research:** EDIT: To the existing and new bots out there, the SLS cult and other believers, yes I will double down if the stock price goes up:) Answering here since I received \"very nice\" DM requests.",

      "selftext_processed": "One day I decided I needed a market edge and so I took a few 50mg Vyvanse broke them off and snorted them to get a faster kick . I then sat for 10 minutes waiting for a DD miracle but nothing_happened ... The problem Vyvanse is a prodrug and so snorting it wont speed up its effects . You see the Lisdexamphetamine is dextroamphetamine with an attached Llysine amino acid that breaks off in your body using enzymes ... thus creating this slowrelease mechanism . I wasnt discouraged and so I took short acting expired Ritalin crushed it into about 120mg worth of powder and used the same delivery process to give me the edge . The delivery process I instantly got hit with Writers euphoria some people say they see colors all I saw was a pumpndump right in front of my eyes reaching the top of its pump . Perfectly timed using behavioral psychology to create strong FOMO to anyone waiting for their next hit of market open . If you havent figured it out yet Im talking about SLS . I will attack this pumpndump scheme from several different views and maybe some of you will join me on this short trip . Buckle up buckeroos were gon na start with fundamentals Currently this shitco is trading at a share price giving it a mkt . cap close to USD 600M . First thing that I ask is who is the customer Its a bunch of unlucky people who basically have at most 12 years to live with a somewhat uncommon form of cancer Acute Myleoid Leukemia . If we look at how many people get it globally were gon na arrive at roughly 1.52.0 persons 100.000 Now lets look at all cancers this will be important ± 200 people 100.000 .... HOLY FUCK THE VYVANSE IS KICKING IN . What I didnt realize was that the Vyvanse has still entered my bloodstream and started dislodging the dextroamphetamine into my bloodstream I have now trasncended into a dopamine and neuroephidephrine fueled state of being . Why am I mentioning all cancers Well its to disrupt the one thing that is being spread through all the pumpndump posts That this is a replacement for Keytruda which was sitting at 25B revenue with 80 % gross margins . But heres the first misconception that is being omitted in all the SLS cult posts Keytruda is allpurpose while the shit that SLS is producing is NOT_You need to be tested for the presence of WT1 antigen which is only done for blood disorderscancers . You may find the presence elsewhere but it says absolutely nothing_about it being usable for this source I know a few doctors . This means that while Keytruda might target the 200 people out of 100 ... SLS drugs will barely target 1 % of that . Why do I say barely Well because that these drugs are given to specific people ... CDK9 is effective only for people with a certain less common mutation and GPS is given to my understanding to people in remission . So lets do simple math before I make you even more depressed USD 25B 1 % 250M lets be optimistic and say that 80 % are eligible 200M But wait it gets better ... however right now my heart is pumping pupils are needlepoint sized and I need to lower the adrenaline in my bloodstream by doing the only sensible thing I learnt from Elon Musk ... low doses of ketamine . Unlocking my full potential Keytruda gets administered constantly unlike GPS which is like 20 injections . So that 200M you were looking at Yea its probably way lower . Now that weve got over the HOLY SHIT THIS THING IS WORTH BILLIONS lets focus on the flying ponies in front of my eyes warning me about the financials and the CEOs marketingdilution pattern . A Good Modern CEO is always Professional Bullshitter . If youve ever worked as a Software Engineer you will always notice two flavors of your average SWE . 1 . The technical guy who actually knows shit 2 . The bullshitter whos liked but does shit and yaps whole day The first one if hes career driven will become a good CTO . The second one will become CEO . This is true for every profession reality is that CEO needs to be able to sell especially bullshit to keep investors happy and to bring them exit liquidity . Its all a zerosum game . Nobody_wins especially not_the poor cancer patients who are used for advertising just like whitemonkeys are in China . The CEO SLS is no_different to other CEOs except that this guy is a master bullshitter . How do you become a master bullshitter Ambiguity . Think of the 1 technical guy he will always be precise in his formulations because he knows what hes talking about . the 2 bullshitter will always be ambiguous because he wants to sound smart . The CEO has a beautiful pattern of selling very ambiguous news carefully wording them in a way that the SLS cult members read bagholders and MLM leaders parrot the actual but notfactual_message to the masses . Just look up the recent posts on bagholderpnd subreddits for SLS . Its all bullshit purposefully pushed by bots and marketing team . After the share price jumps high the CEO cuts a financing deal that basically tanks the price into oblivion not_including the perpetual warrant inducement plan which alone makes acquisition very unlikely . The best part The CEO gets paid heftily even though close to 50 % shareholders want to lower his abovestandard pay . And theres a good reason hes getting such high cash bonuses he knows its all bullshit . All of this will mean that if this company gets acquired which is unlikely it will be sold at a discount and not_a premium . Notice the pattern that even after so many dilutions the market drives the price close to $ 4 a share ... with constantly increasing share count its amplifying the speed at which the companys valuation grows even though they still havent really presented anything substantial . Lets Look at the Recent Catalyst So what spiked the current share price above $ 4 Results of the REGAL study were postponed which was seen negatively and so the CEO wrote a very ambiguous post saying something on the lines of Were still waiting for more deaths so that we can conclude the study . Which is absolutely hilarious . Because it doesnt say anything about SLS specifically yet people interpret it in a way that it does and that the SLS specific treatment is actually the good one it may be but given the pattern I doubt it will be statistically significant The study includes both BAT best available treatment and the SLS drugs . The deaths they are waiting for might well be the BAT ones while the SLS patients have already died grim I know . Their argument Average BAT life expectancy is 8 months or whatever theyre saying . So why do people think its good news for SLS Because people think they understand statistics when they actually dont . Heck I studied it specialized in it as a mathematician ... and even I will never_dare to say that I fully understand statistics . Reality is that the delay might be negative neutral or positive . WHY Many factors come into patient selection The study isnt the typical lets pick 130 people at day 1 and start our tests they come in different cohortsgroups You have high odds of selecting the good group that could even survive 5 years with bad treatment this can be 1015 % All the bull posts you see focus on using the average as proof that this study is going on longer than it should which is a very misleading statistic and using it like this is pure bullshit for gullible people ... Average needs to be understood in a way that you will have people who died after 3 months and people who lived those 5 years and that will average out so just looking at number of occurred deaths is not_enough to know if there is a statistical significance . Saying that the study is going longer than expected is absolute bullshit because if you have the healthier group by accident they will survive longer but it will also be reflected in the final statistical analysis . A small sample size like this is prone to distortions follow up studies will be needed to know if this really works or not_which btw will definitely lead to more cash burn . But most importantly BAT for AML has significantly improved ... and by significantly I mean really significantly . The 8 month figure is somewhat outdated by now as it might be closer to 1012 months . Increasing the actual statistical significance needed to be observed with GPS . Unsustainable Cash Burn and More to Come The cash burn of this company is insane and even if they succeed with their tests they will face even higher cash burn due to the necessary shit they need to do to get this drug approved and into production . Given their current free cash its more than likely that they will need to raise more money . So Why Are You Bearish Well I like to think of it in terms of probability uncertainty specifically conditional probability . Lets denote Pevent A as Probability of Event conditioned by A happening Asks yourself this which probability is higher 1 P Good News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad 2 P Bad News CEO Bullshitted every single time AND Cash Burn bad Which is more likely to be true 1 2 or 1 2 Im gon na go with the likelihood of bad news as probable ... This doesnt mean that the drug wont work I just am certain that they will have to raise cash no_matter what and the valuation once actual funds take a look at the revenue projections wont be as high as the current valuation . The fact that the Trump Admin is pushing for cheaper drugs is also pretty negative for any biotech trying to get their lifesaving medication out there ... This isnt the age of biotech unfortunately . Hence Im buying puts . NOTE Im not_a biochemist I might be wrong and Im betting only money that Im willing to lose so dont follow blindly do your own DD . Also brace for this post being downvoted by the SLS gang and Indian bots . One last thing ... a big middle finger fuck you to anyone who is trying to profit by using dying people as advertisement . My position is small because Im locked down in other trades sharing mostly because I like to do equity research EDIT To the existing and new bots out there the SLS cult and other believers yes I will double down if the stock price goes up Answering here since I received very nice DM requests ."
