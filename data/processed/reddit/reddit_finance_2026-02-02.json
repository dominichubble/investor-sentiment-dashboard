I knew it was going to go down and Thursday even had its warning signs. How are yall going to handle it? When will you start buying more shares? Pre market is looking terrible. WHY IS IT ALL OF MY STOCKS TOO !!! Edit: Half of yall suck. No good advice just hyper critical while having 20 years of experience above me. 40-50 year old losers in this chat. Just some dumbass \"finance bro\" who made this mistake in 2008 when stocks were 5 bucks. Thanks to those who actually did give info or reassurance. I appreciate you.",

      "selftext": "The dollar just closed January near multi-quarter lows, and ING laid out a few reasons why the pressure may not be going away anytime soon. One big driver is global capital flows. Investors are feeling relatively optimistic about growth outside the U.S., especially in emerging markets and commodity-exporting countries. ING notes that portfolio flows into emerging markets are now at their strongest levels in more than a decade and historically, that kind of shift tends to come directly at the expense of the dollar. Another factor is rising political uncertainty in the U.S. Recent events, including market volatility tied to geopolitical headlines and an equity sell-off, showed that the dollar didn’t behave like a traditional safe haven. That’s adding a risk premium to the currency instead of attracting defensive inflows. There’s also pressure coming from global bond markets. Japan’s sell-off in government bonds has spilled over into U.S. Treasuries and UK Gilts, pushing yields higher and weighing on currencies. ING expects this fiscal and rates dynamic to remain a theme throughout the year. Finally, Japan appears increasingly uncomfortable with the recent moves in USD/JPY. Authorities reportedly have up to $100 billion available for potential FX intervention, and ING suggests that any confirmed coordination with the U.S. would be notable the last joint action like that was back in 2011. Taken together, it paints a picture of a dollar facing headwinds from multiple angles: global capital rotation, political risk, bond market stress, and possible FX intervention. Curious how others here are positioning around this especially with emerging markets seeing renewed interest. Source:",

      "selftext": "I am strongly thinking about selling my 53 shares of Nvidia and use that money to buy physical gold. All the news are on how other countries are hoarding precious metals, dumping US debt. How the great tech companies are moving billions of dollars around between themselves to make it seem there is grown and investment. All this AI momentum seems like a fever dream, lacking infrastructure and most of all, the power to run it. Just recently one of this big tech CEOs admitted they have the hardware but not the power. Under this confession, it is clear why they are so desperate to reignite old nuclear plants and create small \"portable\" nuclear ones that are easier to build and transport. This things not only take time, they take gigantic sumes of money and resources. Big tech won't publicly say they are struggling, instead, they will lay off personnel to cover their losses and stay afloat. In January alone we had 26k tech jobs lay offs. I'm afraid this trend will continue through the year. All this to say, I want to preserve my gains before the next stock crash event and physical gold seemsto be a safe place for it, specially if it's money I do not have a need to use in a few years from now. There is also the crypto option, but I would prefer a more tangible investment. I guess what I want advice is, should I wait a bit longer and see if global events trigger a final grow or cut the cord, transform the gains in gold to preserve the wealth and wait for a market crash to jump again and buy low. Thank you in advance.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am strongly thinking about selling my 53 shares of Nvidia and use that money to buy physical gold . All the news are on how other countries are hoarding precious metals dumping US debt . How the great tech companies are moving billions of dollars around between themselves to make it seem there is grown and investment . All this AI momentum seems like a fever dream lacking infrastructure and most of all the power to run it . Just recently one of this big tech CEOs admitted they have the hardware but not_the power . Under this confession it is clear why they are so desperate to reignite old nuclear plants and create small portable nuclear ones that are easier to build and transport . This things not_only take time they take gigantic sumes of money and resources . Big tech wont publicly say they are struggling instead they will lay off personnel to cover their losses and stay afloat . In January alone we had 26k tech jobs lay offs . Im afraid this trend will continue through the year . All this to say I want to preserve my gains before the next stock crash event and physical gold seemsto be a safe place for it specially if its money I do not_have a need to use in a few years from now . There is also the crypto option but I would prefer a more tangible investment . I guess what I want advice is should I wait a bit longer and see if global events trigger a final grow or cut the cord transform the gains in gold to preserve the wealth and wait for a market crash to jump again and buy low . Thank you in advance ."

      "selftext": "*(For disclosure: I don't hold any position in $ANPA, nor do I plan to. I wrote this write up since I found it interesting, and also intersects with other work I'm doing)* ***TLDR: Khaby Lame, the most-followed creator on TikTok, sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $6m in revenue... yes, this is real.*** ***A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality, with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publicly-known employee and hardly any public presence. The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most high-profile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs.*** ***Simply put, the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets.*** Hola fellow regards, If you’ve been reading the news lately, you might’ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok’s most followed creator, Khaby Lame, selling his name and likeness for just shy of a [billion dollars.]( It’s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers, and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame’s success story. The laid-off machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars *looks* built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal. According to the SEC filing, Khaby Lame sold *Step Distinctive Limited* from a Hong Kong-based holding company, *Rich Sparkle Limited*, for the consideration of $975m USD, through **the issuance of 75m ordinary shares** of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive’s shareholders. No cash got exchanged at all, purely shares. Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ANPA, and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing, up to 600% from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point. [Quite a return if you ask me.]( Yet take an actual dive into the company that’s acquiring Khaby’s company, and more specifically, who even underwrote them within the first place, and you’re going to get a picture filled with so many red-flags you’d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… # Rich Sparkle is a \"printing company\" that has no business making a deal of this nature... like at all. With a consideration of nearly $975 million dollars, most would think that Rich Sparkle is, in some way, a firm that’s engaged within the social media or technology space. Maybe an A.I influencer company or something? It’s what I thought too, but Rich Sparkle’s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements. Yes. Printing and designing financial statements. [Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th, 2025.]( A financial statements printing company is paying $975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok’s most popular influencer. What’s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they’re paying Khaby Lame for this company. The company only raked in just $5.88m in revenue the previous year, yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars? [Again, per the prospectus.]( [Listed on the prospectus, ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade.]( $ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th, 2025, raising just **$5m in IPO proceeds** [**(6-k pg.11)**]( The company issued out just 10% of their current shares, which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $50m come the time of the IPO (shares would eventually dilute out to \\~5% of outstanding shares being publicly traded). Just a month later, the stock that initially IPO'd at price of around $4 is trading at [$30 bucks and has added nearly $250m in market capitalization]( with literally no material events happening within that time that neither EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too. Inexplicably [the ticker just... stays in that price range for no real reason at all, no material events, nothing]( for the next few months. That changes on December 15th, 2025. [6-k on December 15th.]( The auditor for Rich Sparkle, Wei Wei & Co, resigned as Sparkle's auditor [effective immediately. ]( wouldn't be too much of a problem (for a company of their stature) if it weren't for the fact that the company has filed already [filed notice that their 20-F is going to come late.]( The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only [one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn (who only has one follower), despite being an American company,]( and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with [zero followers]( and [filler posts that are just stock images]( I'm not one to want to cyberbully a small business, but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company (as of 2/1/26) that just did a $975m acquisition... yeah that's a bit sketchy. # The biggest IPO Sparkle's underwriter got involved in... was historic for all the wrong reasons. I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece I'm working on. This section is where I'll clear that up. The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money, would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares. [Per prospectus]( Eddid Securities. [Their website]( says that they help bring small to medium-size companies to the market, stuff the big investment banks don't have the time for. *Small to medium-size companies*, with the exception of one. [Ain't that a lovely throwback]( To any WSBers that were here during 2022, I'm sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you. Their subsidiary, Digital, randomly skyrocketed 30,000% within the span of mere weeks in July-August 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world. The only problem is that no one exactly knew how this was even possible, and no, it wasn't a meme stock as the media often claimed. AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kong-related stocks (Regencell, Addentax, etc) that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $400b+ at its peak only to dump 90% right after. The guy behind the IPO, Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO, and, a year and a half before, was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of China's biggest investment firms, CMIG. This feud was so public, CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a *fraudster they shouldn't invest with.* [one of us if I'm being real 😶‍🌫️]( While AMTD's stock surge still hasn't been publicly explained yet, it's pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider co-ordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola, Facebook, and Walmart (no I'm not joking) within the span of weeks. The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process? Looking at the underwriting records, where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process ([prospectus]( [Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022]( Of course, this isn't definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital, but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with, while also considering that $ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider co-ordination. AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC (Hong Kong's version of the SEC). They recently got fined for failing to [produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market.]( Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to \"*have lost records and books relating to the listing of multi-million dollar companies*\" # Conclusion. I'm not here to make any definitive claims, but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is, and that the media is not reporting on any of it, at all. With the clear influencer angle, and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has, I feel like it's hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that don't really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally *cooked*. Anyways, hope you enjoyed this write-up. I'm out.",

      "selftext_processed": "For disclosure I dont hold any position in $ ANPA nor do I plan to . I wrote this write up since I found it interesting and also intersects with other work Im doing TLDR Khaby Lame the mostfollowed creator on TikTok sold his holding company to an extremely suspicious Chinese company that sells financial statement printing services and only does $ 6m in revenue ... yes this is real . A deeper dive into the company shows a valuation completely disconnected from reality with an auditor resignation at the end of last year being replaced by an auditor with only one publiclyknown employee and hardly any public presence . The underwriter for the traded listing is also involved with the most highprofile case of suspicious Hong Kong IPOs . Simply put the acquisition is as suspect as it gets on the markets . Hola fellow regards If you ’ ve been reading the news lately you might ’ ve seen this piece of news pop up regarding TikTok ’ s most followed creator Khaby Lame selling his name and likeness for just shy of a billion dollars . It ’ s a deal that seems virtually unprecedented within the space of social media influencers and a deal that should make you feel good about Khaby Lame ’ s success story . The laidoff machine operator turned global TikTok superstar that sold his company for a billion dollars looks built for the movie theatres… until you actually look a bit more into this deal . According to the SEC filing Khaby Lame sold Step Distinctive Limited from a Hong Kongbased holding company Rich Sparkle Limited for the consideration of $ 975m USD through the issuance of 75m ordinary shares of Rich Sparkle to Distinctive ’ s shareholders . No_cash got exchanged at all purely shares . Rich Sparkle Limited themselves trade on the NASDAQ under the ticker $ ANPA and the news of the acquisition of this deal sent shares skyrocketing up to 600 % from previous levels seen at the start of the month at some point . Quite a return if you ask me . Yet take an actual dive into the company that ’ s acquiring Khaby ’ s company and more specifically who even underwrote them within the first place and you ’ re going to get a picture filled with so many redflags you ’ d think it was a USSR propaganda piece… Rich Sparkle is a printing company that has no_business making a deal of this nature ... like at all . With a consideration of nearly $ 975 million dollars most would think that Rich Sparkle is in some way a firm that ’ s engaged within the social media or technology space . Maybe an A.I influencer company or something It ’ s what I thought too but Rich Sparkle ’ s prospectus lists themselves as… a financial printing company that produces and designs financial statements . Yes . Printing and designing financial statements . Taken right from their prospectus on July 9th 2025 . A financial statements printing company is paying $ 975m for a company that owns the likeliness of TikTok ’ s most popular influencer . What ’ s even stranger is the fact that this company barely has made any revenue anywhere close to the consideration that they ’ re paying Khaby Lame for this company . The company only raked in just $ 5.88m in revenue the previous year yet somehow this company is able to acquire a company for just shy of a billion dollars Again per the prospectus . Listed on the prospectus ANPA offered 1.25m shares to trade . $ ANPA went public on the NASDAQ offering 1.25m shares on July 8th 2025 raising just $ 5m in IPO proceeds 6k pg.11 The company issued out just 10 % of their current shares which gave the IPO a valuation of nearly $ 50m come the time of the IPO shares would eventually dilute out to 5 % of outstanding shares being publicly traded . Just a month later the stock that initially IPOd at price of around $ 4 is trading at $ 30 bucks and has added nearly $ 250m in market capitalization with literally no_material events happening within that time that neither_EDGAR nor anywhere else on the internet I could find could give a reason too . Inexplicably the ticker just ... stays in that price range for no_real reason at all no_material events nothing_for the next few months . That changes on December 15th 2025 . 6k on December 15th . The auditor for Rich Sparkle Wei Wei Co resigned as Sparkles auditor effective immediately . wouldnt be too much of a problem for a company of their stature if it werent for the fact that the company has filed already filed notice that their 20F is going to come late . The latest auditor that Sparkle appointed the same day the previous one resigned has only one affiliated person with a job there on their LinkedIn who only has one follower despite being an American company and Facebook and Twitter accounts both with zero followers and filler posts that are just stock images Im not_one to want to cyberbully a small business but this audit firm being in charge of auditing a billion dollar company as of 2126 that just did a $ 975m acquisition ... yeah thats a bit sketchy . The biggest IPO Sparkles underwriter got involved in ... was historic for all the wrong reasons . I mentioned in my disclosure that this intersects with another piece Im working on . This section is where Ill clear that up . The most obvious link to figuring out how on earth a shitco like Rich Sparkle could achieve a billion dollar valuation from literally printing paper for money would be through looking at the underwriting structure to see who had been in control of allocating shares . Per prospectus Eddid Securities . Their website says that they help bring small to mediumsize companies to the market stuff the big investment banks dont have the time for . Small to mediumsize companies with the exception of one . Aint that a lovely throwback To any WSBers that were here during 2022 Im sure AMTD might sound like a familiar name to you . Their subsidiary Digital randomly skyrocketed 30000 % within the span of mere weeks in JulyAugust 2022 to become one of the most valuable companies in the world . The only problem is that no_one exactly knew how this was even possible and no_it wasnt a meme stock as the media often claimed . AMTD is probably the most infamous name from a bunch of Hong Kongrelated stocks Regencell Addentax etc that ballooned to a cartoonish valuation of $ 400b at its peak only to dump 90 % right after . The guy behind the IPO Calvin Choi was banned months before the IPO and a year and a half before was publicly accused of siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars by one of Chinas biggest investment firms CMIG . This feud was so public CMIG hung banners around Hong Kong to tell people that Choi was a fraudster they shouldnt invest with . one of us if Im being real 😶‍🌫️ While AMTDs stock surge still hasnt been publicly explained yet its pretty obvious to infer that there had to be some sort of insider coordination to manage to get a shell shitco worth more than Coca Cola Facebook and Walmart no Im not_joking within the span of weeks . The most obvious way to see that parties involved in that process Looking at the underwriting records where none other than Eddid themselves were involved in that process prospectus Cited from the prospectus for Digital in 2022 Of course this isnt definitive proof that they colluded with AMTD with whatever happened in Digital but it gives us a pretty good idea of the sort of companies this underwriter chooses to associate with while also considering that $ ANPA has the hallmarks of a stock that has some level on insider coordination . AMTD themselves are being investigated for their underwriting practices by the SFC Hong Kongs version of the SEC . They recently got fined for failing to produce records subponaed from companies they help bring to market . Eddid seems to have associated themselves with an underwriter that claimed to have lost records and books relating to the listing of multimillion dollar companies Conclusion . Im not_here to make any definitive claims but mostly here to point out how ridiculously insane this rabbit hole of a story is and that the media is not_reporting on any of it at all . With the clear influencer angle and the suspect financials and history that Rich Sparkle has I feel like its hard to deny that this being used in a scheme to deceive retail investors or people that dont really know any better to buy into a stock that is fundamentally cooked . Anyways hope you enjoyed this writeup . Im out ."

I tried to make the math work with a dcf assuming a recovery to $3 fcf/share (averaging the good and bad years) and i still only get like $58 fair value. plus the ROIC is down to 10% which is super low for them, basically barely covering their cost of capital. Feels like a value trap until earnings actually bottom. i'm waiting for $45 to get a real margin of safety. Anyone buying here or is it just dead money until 2027?",

      "selftext": "Source: [ Oracle Corporation (NYSE: [ORCL](#financial-modal)) today announced its full calendar year 2026 plan to fund the expansion of its rapidly growing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business. Oracle is raising money in order to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from our largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers, including AMD, Meta, NVIDIA, OpenAI, TikTok, xAI and others. Oracle expects to raise $45 to $50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year. The company plans to achieve its funding objective by using a balanced combination of debt and equity financing to maintain a solid investment-grade balance sheet. On the equity side, Oracle plans to raise approximately half of its 2026 funding through a combination of equity-linked and common equity issuances. This is expected to include an initial issuance of mandatory convertible preferred securities, representing a modest portion of the overall equity funding, as well as a newly authorized at-the-market equity program of up to $20 billion. The company plans to issue equity from the at-the-market program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices, based on market conditions and capital needs. On the debt side, Oracle intends to complete a single, one-time issuance of investment-grade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the company's planned funding for the year. Oracle does not expect to issue additional bonds during calendar year 2026 beyond this transaction. This funding plan reflects Oracle's commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating, prudent capital allocation, balance sheet strength, and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business. These transactions have been approved by the Oracle Board of Directors. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering, and Citigroup will be leading the at-the-market issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering.",

      "selftext_processed": "Source Oracle Corporation NYSE ORCLfinancialmodal today announced its full calendar year 2026 plan to fund the expansion of its rapidly growing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business . Oracle is raising money in order to build additional capacity to meet the contracted demand from our largest Oracle Cloud Infrastructure customers including AMD Meta NVIDIA OpenAI TikTok xAI and others . Oracle expects to raise $ 45 to $ 50 billion of gross cash proceeds during the 2026 calendar year . The company plans to achieve its funding objective by using a balanced combination of debt and equity financing to maintain a solid investmentgrade balance sheet . On the equity side Oracle plans to raise approximately half of its 2026 funding through a combination of equitylinked and common equity issuances . This is expected to include an initial issuance of mandatory convertible preferred securities representing a modest portion of the overall equity funding as well as a newly authorized atthemarket equity program of up to $ 20 billion . The company plans to issue equity from the atthemarket program flexibly over time at prevailing market prices based on market conditions and capital needs . On the debt side Oracle intends to complete a single onetime issuance of investmentgrade senior unsecured bonds early in 2026 to cover the other half of the companys planned funding for the year . Oracle does not_expect to issue additional bonds during calendar year 2026 beyond this transaction . This funding plan reflects Oracles commitment to maintaining an investmentgrade rating prudent capital allocation balance sheet strength and transparency with investors as the company continues to expand its Oracle Cloud Infrastructure business . These transactions have been approved by the Oracle Board of Directors . Goldman Sachs Co. LLC will be leading the senior unsecured bond offering and Citigroup will be leading the atthemarket issuance and mandatory convertible preferred equity offering ."

Shopify isn’t just a “website builder” anymore. It has effectively become the default infrastructure layer for small and mediumsized online businesses, and increasingly for larger brands as well.

It has effectively become the default infrastructure layer for small and mediumsized online businesses and increasingly for larger brands as well .

As it turns out, I was right and deleveraging happened on Friday, January 30. And it is not as if central banks came and sold all their gold. Gold and silver are commodities has always been traded just based on demand and supply. However, the current rally has been fueled because momentum traders have started treating gold and silver now as securities. These traders buy huge amount of call options of the ETF even on margins rather than buying actual physical gold or silver. This leads to Market maker hedging their sold options, by buying the ton of shares of those ETFs which eventually drives up the artificially inflated prices. People are calling this rally as a Dollar debasement trade, however, behind the scenes just manipulation of some Wall Street traders is going on now. The government, Wall Street, media are all colluded. They orchestrate all such situations which leads to gold pumps News on wars, AI bubble, inflation, weak dollar. This cycle is similar to 1970s(nixon removing dollar to backed by gold) , 2008(GFC) and now this. In 1970 and 2008 cycle people lost faith in dollar, but over time dollar again became strong and now it is going through its next cycle. Physical gold buying has already slowed down because of the purchasing power has exhausted. Now only central banks are the buyers.",

      "selftext": "The extraordinary price action in metals on Friday was plastered with comments from ex JPM global head Marko Kolanovic warning of massive correction in Silver prices due this year. Interestingly his latest post on X intraday Jan 30 when the price action was unfolding was about SLV rebounding. Peter Schiff sounded similar note at close of trading on Friday. The price action esp for Silver was truly extraordinary. One for the record books however I don’t think the doom and gloom end of the world posts all over the web actually capture the underlying structural shifts that have been in play in the precious metals market over the last year. 1 - physical demand story for Silver is still intact. The AI buildout, industrial demand for solar, electronics is still there. The biggest global silver miner Fresnillo has actually cut its 2026 production guidance. Even on friday the physical silver premium in shanghai was over $20. 2026 like its predecessor years will be marred by shortfall in silver supply unable to match the demand forecasts. 2 - another major trigger for Friday’s price action was obviously announcement of Kevin Warsh as fed pick. Markets have immediately perceived him as an interest rate hawk on balance based on his previous positioning. I think we are underestimating trump’s push for lower interest rates and the extent he went to pressure powell in aligning to his agendas. Its unthinkable that Trump wouldn’t have covered base with Kevin Warsh on what is expected of the next fed chair. 3 - yet another technical trigger for Friday’s price action was change in margin rules by CME on silver and gold contracts. I think this was the primary reason more than any other for the violent unwinding of the leverage trade in precious metals. Precious metals may not reclaim the ATHs anytime soon but I don’t think the story is over. I think the debasement trade, multi polar world order leading to uncertain geopolitical setup( potential iran attack, trumps impulsive trade wars) are still in play and will be for quite some time which in turn will keep SLV and GLD up and center.",

      "selftext": "I can't tell you how stressful this entire experience has been. Some of you remember my Intel position - I had worked my way back from being down 95% into 39k, netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings. Once I made my original investment back, I went full regard and did some VERY aggressive futures options trades with gold/silver/oil/nasdaq. Here we are, and I'm still in disbelief when I check the account total. I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude. I'm now trading nat gas (probably too big of a position), but no aggressive trades and definitely no more 0 DTE I just want to say: if you're down big atm, there's still a chance. It isn't going to be easy (I've spent every day/night hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets) but there's a chance you can come back. None of this is worth the stress though. That post-nut clarity once you've made it back is pretty sick though. \\[the large P/L for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $4900 on Friday - as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x...believe it or not those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $4700.\\]",

Some of you remember my Intel position I had worked my way back from being down 95 % into 39k netted 55k profit from that by going long on puts right before earnings . Once I made my original investment back I went full regard and did some VERY aggressive futures options trades with goldsilveroilnasdaq . Here we are and Im still in disbelief when I check the account total . I mostly traded off of VWAP and it worked really well with metals and crude . Im now trading nat gas probably too big of a position but no_aggressive trades and definitely no_more 0 DTE I just want to say if youre down big atm theres still a chance . It isnt going to be easy Ive spent every daynight hunting for positions to enter with overly aggressive targets but theres a chance you can come back . None of this is worth the stress though . That postnut clarity once youve made it back is pretty sick though . the large PL for the day is from me being gold calls at that bottom when the market was selling off before it rebounded to $ 4900 on Friday as the market dumped I set limit buys on ITM calls at a pretty cheap price and once those filled I set limit sells at 10x ... believe it or not_those actually filled immediately once the market bounced off of $ 4700 ."

      "selftext": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates. Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2% at 2% inflation, President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1%, presumably around the middle of 2026 (I will explain why soon). Economics tells us, however, that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively, you need the stock market to drop, and quite hard. This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs, it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly, providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone, causing inflation to jump very quickly - potentially out of control. Of course, if you're cutting rates from the rather high 4.5% to the still high 3.75%, it isn't going to cause these issues, especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now, but the extreme 1% will not work the same. These factors, and more evidence which I will present here, leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop. Because isn't it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st (and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies), Trump announced the new Fed Chair, and the Epstein files were released (and some Iran news). Even more interesting, according to Business Insider, the Dow, on average, drops 15% after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair. February 1st was also the exact day that Trump would've pushed 10% tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise - and guess what? The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1. I don't believe it's a coincidence, but even if you do, we've had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 - hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic. Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he would've raised the tariffs by another 15%, ultimately leading me to believe June and July - after perhaps a 15-20% drop which would not surprise me - will be the bottom of this incoming bear market, and the time where rates will be cut to 1%. So, what do you think of this? Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not make it overly political. Thanks! Oh, and be careful bulls!",

      "selftext_processed": "We all know Trump is very dovish on interest rates . Whereas a very generalized ideal target for rates is considered 2 % at 2 % inflation President Trump wishes for interest rates to eventually reach half of that at 1 % presumably around the middle of 2026 I will explain why soon . Economics tells us however that in order to cut interest rates so aggressively you need the stock market to drop and quite hard . This is because if you try and cut rates while the market is near all time highs it is very easy for it to begin rallying very quickly providing investors with relatively easy profits and cheap loans for everyone causing inflation to jump very quickly potentially out of control . Of course if youre cutting rates from the rather high 4.5 % to the still high 3.75 % it isnt going to cause these issues especially considering the market has been moving sideways for a couple months now but the extreme 1 % will not_work the same . These factors and more evidence which I will present here leads me to believe that Trump wishes for the market to drop . Because isnt it such a coincidence that on the final trading day before February 1st and after a series of earnings reports by many key companies Trump announced the new Fed Chair and the Epstein files were released and some Iran news . Even more interesting according to Business Insider the Dow on average drops 15 % after the first 6 months of a newly appointed Fed Chair . February 1st was also the exact day that Trump wouldve pushed 10 % tariffs onto several EU nations until he cancelled them after a compromise and guess what The selloff is literally started the trading day before Feb 1 . I dont believe its a coincidence but even if you do weve had a 3 year bull market starting from October 2022 hoping for another rally that will last yet another year is unrealistic . Trump also said that June 1st will be the date where he wouldve raised the tariffs by another 15 % ultimately leading me to believe June and July after perhaps a 1520 % drop which would not_surprise me will be the bottom of this incoming bear market and the time where rates will be cut to 1 % . So what do you think of this Feel free to comment and reply but I ask respectfully to not_make it overly political . Thanks Oh and be careful bulls"

      "selftext": "Microsoft Dominance, Pricing power, and considering the scale of company discount is meaningful. Oracle: oracle has fallen more than microsoft but considering oracles pe and that growth at oracle is capped ; microsoft has the better discount. Service now, has fallen 40 peecent this year but its not a true discount because valuation still rich with a high pe Cloudflare is always expensive. The 30% drop just makes it \"less expensive\" It’s an asymmetric play on the future ; connection, streaming in ap apps. Not much of a discount considering its previous run up, and profit? Unity : Deep discount for a growth company that has lots of options! But does not have discipline, overpaid for acquisitions, overpaid employees, at the expense of shareholders and customers. Snowflake: substantial discount ,could definitely drop more, worth buying at lower levels. Endava: Tam overestimated ,now tam underestimated. Inotiv :absolutely massive discount, from its high its 96 percent down, 96 percent off for a company that sells services to half the pharma companies. But current environment does not favor it. Adobe Has fallen over thirty percent, loved by value investors. Could fall another ten percent but a new product in the future may suprise investors. But at this point in time growth is an issue. I think figma is a stronger growth stock. Tradesk Fallen seventy percent, but still overpriced, no real discount. Toast, one year low. Expanding Tam and upsell potential, but competition means margins may be squeezed. Cover / Lightspeed Commerce / oracle could put pressure on toast. Amplitude - minus 20 this month: Amplitude is a clear winner in analytics, its analytics are used by everyone in an organization but low pricing power with too many competitors Similarweb unbelievable discount of 70 percent for an analytics company about to turn profitable,May be bought over by hyperscalers who want their analytics , but hyperscalers might deepen their own analytic capabilities especially since they have the data ,alternatively hyperscalers might buy a smaller analytics company. Reddit reached a three month low, falling by 16 percent , which isnt much considering how much the company is up. But if you really wanted to invest in reddit you can buy on dips strategy( each time it hits a three month low). Could go mich lower could go much higher so the discount isnt something you would use-to determine whether to buy Etsy ‘ minus ten percent- not really a significant drop for a midsize company already priced high. But etsy has high margins and is heavily underestimated on growth. Pinterest, year low, uncertainty, more flimsy compared to amazon tik tok meta, but growth potential is massive.Already transitioning to growth company. Root down 36 percent this year Could potentially beat traditional insurers but even if it proves its AI works a lot better, telematics is not a monopoly anymore. If every insurer adds telematics hard to see roots advantage. Rezolve, 2.60 from its height of 6. The only stock here that could tenx, Rezolve is moving from r and d gear and now going into full force sales gear . Figma, although its been around a long time still a very young company and business model will change over the next two years. This one might be worth investing once we have a clearer idea of business model and products. When they were publishing their ipo and sec it hinted there were going to move beyond credit pricing to outcome prising. Wait for proof then buy! Upwork, this is my favorite for value. Pe under ten. Ai teams , Ai matching and many users mean a strong moat.Margins are improving as well Small caps Rime, another one of my favourites , it fixes three things, empty miles, failed logistic model, and indian messy logistics. Is it priced in? Well that depends on what you think Rimes true TAM is? Do you think its all logistics, or only niche logistics. On one hand youve got many competitors, on the other hand Rime can work with competitors. Worksport down 80 percent selling a product that hasnt been sold before so no way to say this is a buy. But the science works, and they sell an incredibly useful product, truck covers that can solar charge. Arrive Ai Another logistics company (drones plus boxnow) Arrive AI is used for high value, delicate deliveries such as medicine that needs to be kept at a certain temperature but integration with legacy systems is no easy task Duolingo Massive discount, for great quality companany Ui path minus twenty percent in a month. Ui path: best in class ai integration , but very expensive especially for a smaller company upgrading to the pro plan Railvision Train safety and predictive insights into infrastructure but regulatory hurdles, and long upgrade cycles Diginex (DGNX)- massive discount 98 percent Regulatory ESG makes sure some customers will buy. But who will customers buy from currently diginex Esg is competitors have the advantage with scale, credibility, Jet Ai - massive discount 98 Percent in the last two months AI optimization improves fleet utilization, however has no real moat, no pricing power, costs are high, sensitive to customer spend. Growth buys: Pininterest, Rezolve Toast Strong buys: Microsoft Upwork Buys: Adobe , Figma ( between the two figma has more upside unlesss adobe suprises us) Buy later: Snowflake, Reddit . Endeva",

      "selftext_processed": "Microsoft Dominance Pricing power and considering the scale of company discount is meaningful . Oracle oracle has fallen more than microsoft but considering oracles pe and that growth at oracle is capped microsoft has the better discount . Service now has fallen 40 peecent this year but its not_a true discount because valuation still rich with a high pe Cloudflare is always expensive . The 30 % drop just makes it less expensive It ’ s an asymmetric play on the future connection streaming in ap apps . Not_much of a discount considering its previous run up and profit Unity Deep discount for a growth company that has lots of options But does not_have discipline overpaid for acquisitions overpaid employees at the expense of shareholders and customers . Snowflake substantial discount could definitely drop more worth buying at lower levels . Endava Tam overestimated now tam underestimated . Inotiv absolutely massive discount from its high its 96 percent down 96 percent off for a company that sells services to half the pharma companies . But current environment does not_favor it . Adobe Has fallen over thirty percent loved by value investors . Could fall another ten percent but a new product in the future may suprise investors . But at this point in time growth is an issue . I think figma is a stronger growth stock . Tradesk Fallen seventy percent but still overpriced no_real discount . Toast one year low . Expanding Tam and upsell potential but competition means margins may be squeezed . Cover Lightspeed Commerce oracle could put pressure on toast . Amplitude minus 20 this month Amplitude is a clear winner in analytics its analytics are used by everyone in an organization but low pricing power with too many competitors Similarweb unbelievable discount of 70 percent for an analytics company about to turn profitableMay be bought over by hyperscalers who want their analytics but hyperscalers might deepen their own analytic capabilities especially since they have the data alternatively hyperscalers might buy a smaller analytics company . Reddit reached a three month low falling by 16 percent which isnt much considering how much the company is up . But if you really wanted to invest in reddit you can buy on dips strategy each time it hits a three month low . Could go mich lower could go much higher so the discount isnt something you would useto determine whether to buy Etsy ‘ minus ten percent not_really a significant drop for a midsize company already priced high . But etsy has high margins and is heavily underestimated on growth . Pinterest year low uncertainty more flimsy compared to amazon tik tok meta but growth potential is massive.Already transitioning to growth company . Root down 36 percent this year Could potentially beat traditional insurers but even if it proves its AI works a lot better telematics is not_a monopoly anymore . If every insurer adds telematics hard to see roots advantage . Rezolve 2.60 from its height of 6 . The only stock here that could tenx Rezolve is moving from r and d gear and now going into full force sales gear . Figma although its been around a long time still a very young company and business model will change over the next two years . This one might be worth investing once we have a clearer idea of business model and products . When they were publishing their ipo and sec it hinted there were going to move beyond credit pricing to outcome prising . Wait for proof then buy Upwork this is my favorite for value . Pe under ten . Ai teams Ai matching and many users mean a strong moat.Margins are improving as well Small caps Rime another one of my favourites it fixes three things empty miles failed logistic model and indian messy logistics . Is it priced in Well that depends on what you think Rimes true TAM is Do you think its all logistics or only niche logistics . On one hand youve got many competitors on the other hand Rime can work with competitors . Worksport down 80 percent selling a product that hasnt been sold before so no_way to say this is a buy . But the science works and they sell an incredibly useful product truck covers that can solar charge . Arrive Ai Another logistics company drones plus boxnow Arrive AI is used for high value delicate deliveries such as medicine that needs to be kept at a certain temperature but integration with legacy systems is no_easy task Duolingo Massive discount for great quality companany Ui path minus twenty percent in a month . Ui path best in class ai integration but very expensive especially for a smaller company upgrading to the pro plan Railvision Train safety and predictive insights into infrastructure but regulatory hurdles and long upgrade cycles Diginex DGNX massive discount 98 percent Regulatory ESG makes sure some customers will buy . But who will customers buy from currently diginex Esg is competitors have the advantage with scale credibility Jet Ai massive discount 98 Percent in the last two months AI optimization improves fleet utilization however has no_real moat no_pricing power costs are high sensitive to customer spend .

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m 19 and I’ve been investing into my tfsa a bit here and there since I got it up and running. About 300 a month. Here’s my question however, I’m not super knowledgeable about the stock market but I’ve always been curious about investing my money myself and crypto has also spiked my interest a few times, I have a broker who invests the 300 dollars a month for me, he’s a family friend so I know him personally and he’s been doing this for a very long time. I’ve thought about opening my own Wealth Simple tfsa so I can put some money into that every month and invest myself into stock and etf, etc myself. Is it better to just keep letting my broker do it himself or should I contribute 200 or so a month into my Wealth Simple so I can invest myself. I know that was a bit to read and getting to the question took a bit but I wanted to not leave out any info lol. Thanks everyone !",

My worries: is a hypothetical war with the UN going to tank ETFs? Is this current administration trying to dry up the USD and transfer their wealth to BTC? If im this unsure about it, wouldn’t investing in physical currency be the best method? I am uncertain if the USD will be a fundamental currency in the next 10 years, and am even more uncertain about the stock market’s ups and downs during this unprecedented political climate. That being said, I am still casually buying into single stocks that I trust and am reluctantly still adding into my Roth.",

My worries is a hypothetical war with the UN going to tank ETFs Is this current administration trying to dry up the USD and transfer their wealth to BTC If im this unsure about it wouldn ’ t investing in physical currency be the best method I am uncertain if the USD will be a fundamental currency in the next 10 years and am even more uncertain about the stock market ’ s ups and downs during this unprecedented political climate .

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I’m a Nu holder and wanted to share an experience from a close friend in Brazil who recently decided to use Nu’s app to buy stocks instead of a traditional broker. Honestly, the experience sounds pretty rough. Some of the main issues he ran into: - You can only buy full shares (no fractional shares at all); - He placed a sell order during market hours, but the cash from the sale didn’t show up immediately in his account; - No live stock prices, you can’t really track price movements in real time; - Very limited information on the stocks (no depth, no proper charts, no context); - App navigation is Portuguese-only, no language flexibility; - The app feels cluttered with ads pushing credit products and services; - Buying and selling stocks doesn’t feel smooth or intuitive at all. This made me wonder: Is Nu treating stock investing as a serious long-term product, or just a secondary feature to cross-sell credit and banking services? As investors, we often focus on: user growth, engagement, ecosystem expansion. But product quality matters, especially if Nu wants to keep users inside its platform instead of losing them to real brokers. For those in Brazil actually using Nu Invest: Has this been your experience too? Has it improved recently? Do you still use it, or did you move to another platform? Curious to hear real user feedback, especially from locals.",

      "selftext": "I opened a ROTH IRA through an advisor 5 years ago. I was/am very ignorant of investing. One of my friends who is more savvy recommend I look into ditching the advisor and doing it myself to save on fees. I looked through my statements and saw around $300 advisor fees charged to my account quarterly for 2025. That's around $1200 a year in fees! I checked 2021-2024 and it was only a $40 fee once per year during those years which is a relief. I believe this new advisor fee is due to a change I made with my advisor last year. I don't think the advisor did anything shady. They more than likely did mention fees but I probably didn't ask enough questions about it. My friend also made me aware of all the \"invisible\" fees associated with actively managed accounts from trades. So now I'm looking to course correct and avoid any addition advisor fees. I'm considering transferring my ROTH IRA to Robinhood because a friend told me about their 3% match for IRA transfers and contributions, or Fidelity since that's what my 401k is in and it'd be nice to have it all in once place. I am aware that I need to do a direct transfer of a ROTH to a ROTH, not withdraw what I already have. Are there any other things I should consider before transferring a ROTH IRA between brokerages? I want to make sure I do my due diligence before making a costly mistake. Next. Once I transfer to the new brokerage to manage the ROTH myself, I want to sell everything that the advisor had me in. I did a bit of research and the consistent thing I found was that they had high(er) expense ratios. My friend also said they had me in more things than necessary that probably overlapped. I was planning on doing the 3 Portfolio Setup of Vanguard mutual funds. The split would be 80% stock(US and Foreign) and 20% bonds. Vanguard seems like a safe bet based on the research that I've done. I'm not looking to do anything fancy or game the market. I'm just going to max my contribution each year, then sit and hold for 30 years. Is there anything else I should be aware of or cautious about when it comes to any of the things I mentioned above? Transferring a ROTH IRA to a ROTH IRA, then selling everything my advisor had me in, then buying the Vanguard mutual funds in a 3 Portfolio Setup. I feel like that should be simple and straightforward but I want to do my due diligence and educate myself first. I know ROTH stuff grows tax deferred but would any of the stuff I plan on doing have any tax implications? Any help is appreciated.",

And with that also more at risk of losing a lot of money? Or is this just a me thing and can other people with adhd who invest not relate?

From what I see, I basically have two options: Option 1: Just stay with Revolut and keep investing there. Option 2: Slowly move out: • Each month, sell a position using my free trades • Reinvest that money into Trading 212 • Stop adding new money to Revolut and only fund 212 going forward Transferring everything at once isn’t really an option, because Revolut charges €35 per stock for transfers.

Lately, I’ve been thinking about switching to Trading 212, but I’m a bit stuck on how (or if) I should do it. Right now, I have the Revolut Metal subscription, which gives me 10 free trades per month, and I’ve already paid for the full year. From what I see, I basically have two options: Option 1: Just stay with Revolut and keep investing there, since I’m already paying for Metal anyway. Option 2: Slowly move out: • Each month, sell a position using my free trades • Reinvest that money into Trading 212 • Stop adding new money to Revolut and only fund 212 going forward Transferring everything at once isn’t really an option, because Revolut charges €35 per stock for transfers. Give me your advice. If you want to advise another broker feel free, I live at Europe if that helps.",

I’ve tried investing a few times before, nothing serious. Small amounts, short periods. My dad was a gambling addict, so I’m very aware of that risk and I really don’t want to go down that road. Still, for some reason I’m decent at reading the market, waiting, not panicking. At least so far. In the past, the most I ever made was maybe €400 or €500. This time was different. With the market the way it is and some lucky decisions, I ended up turning that €100 into about €4,500 in a week and a half. I’m grateful, obviously. That money actually matters in my life and gives me some breathing room. But I also feel weird about it. Almost guilty. It makes my normal work feel pointless. I work my hours, I do side jobs, I try to improve my situation slowly… and then this happens, and it feels completely disconnected from effort or value. The market feels real and fake at the same time. Aggressive, almost brutal. Like you’re winning only because someone else is losing. I don’t know. I didn’t expect the money to bother me this much, but it does",

      "title": "How to filter Insider Trading data: Why buying high is actually a stronger signal than buying low",
      "selftext": "**Disclaimer: This is a shortened version of a longer analysis, so I will try to explain my strategy at once** Okay, so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals, better data, and direct lines to management. Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However, there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours: SEC Form 4 Filings. I’ve spent the last few months (during my masters degree) refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity. I’m not talking about following politicians. I’m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it’s public. Below is the framework I use to filter this data, backed by academic research that explains *why* this works. # The Signal: The \"Cluster Buy\" A single insider buying stock can mean anything. They might be saving face, diversifying, or just optimistic. It’s noisy data. The real signal is the **Cluster Buy**. This occurs when **three or more unique insiders** purchase stock on the open market within a short window (usually <30 days). * **Why it matters:** Research by Alldredge and Blank (2019) confirms that insiders \"herd\" with their colleagues. They found an insider is nearly **four times more likely** to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently * **The Hierarchy:** Not all clusters are equal. Clusters led by **CFOs and Directors** exhibit the highest subsequent returns. The CFO knows the numbers; Directors see the strategy. When they move together, it’s a high-conviction signal. # The Filter: Ignoring the Noise 90% of insider transactions are noise. To find the alpha, you have to filter aggressively. Here are the three specific filters I use: **1. Ignore \"Routine\" Trades** We are looking for **Opportunistic Traders**. If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons, that trade contains zero information. You want to see trades that break a pattern. **2. The \"Buy High\" Anomaly** Conventional wisdom says \"buy low.\" However, research by Li, Wang, Yan, and Zhang (2019) uncovered a powerful anomaly: **Insiders who buy at 52-week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52-week lows**. * **The Logic:** This is called overcoming \"Anchoring Bias.\" Psychologically, it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30%. If an insider buys at a 52-week high, they are fighting human nature. They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher. A \"High Buy\" is a massive confidence signal. **3. The \"Not-Sold\" Signal** Sometimes the best signal is what insiders *don't* do. DeVault, Cederburg, and Wang (2021) analyzed **Portfolio Insiders** (directors who sit on multiple boards). * **The Signal:** If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B, and they sell Company A but **hold** Company B, the \"Not-Sold\" stock (Company B) significantly outperforms the market. If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock, check if those insiders are selling their *other* holdings to fund it. That doubles the conviction. # The Execution: Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one. Execution is where you make or lose money. **Rule 1: Wait for Price Confirmation** Insiders are notoriously early. They are value investors with infinite time horizons. You are not. * **My Trigger:** I wait for the stock to **reclaim the average price** of the insider's purchase. * **The Logic:** If the CFO buys at $50 and the stock drops to $40, the market disagrees with him. I stay away. When the stock rallies back through $50, it confirms the \"Insider Floor\" is holding and momentum is aligning with the insider's view. **Rule 2: Focus on Liquid Stocks** Paradoxically, insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks. Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume. A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks. **Rule 3: The \"Silent\" Exit** Retail investors usually sell too early or too late. I watch the insiders. If they stop buying during a subsequent dip, or if they start \"Routine\" selling into strength, the edge is gone. # Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash (especially at 52-week highs) it is the purest signal of value you can find. I track these **Cluster Buys** and publish a deep-dive watchlist of the most significant ones every week.",

      "selftext_processed": "Disclaimer This is a shortened version of a longer analysis so I will try to explain my strategy at once Okay so we know şnstitutional desks have faster terminals better data and direct lines to management . Out trade them on technicals or headline news is a losing battle However there is one specific area where the law forces the smart money to show their hand to us within 48 hours SEC Form 4 Filings . I ’ ve spent the last few months during my masters degree refining a strategy based exclusively on Corporate Insider Activity . I ’ m not_talking about following politicians . I ’ m talking about following the CFO who sees the weekly sales report before it ’ s public . Below is the framework I use to filter this data backed by academic research that explains why this works . The Signal The Cluster Buy A single insider buying stock can mean anything . They might be saving face diversifying or just optimistic . It ’ s noisy data . The real signal is the Cluster Buy . This occurs when three or more unique insiders purchase stock on the open market within a short window usually 30 days . Why it matters Research by Alldredge and Blank 2019 confirms that insiders herd with their colleagues . They found an insider is nearly four times more likely to purchase stock if a colleague has purchased recently The Hierarchy Not_all clusters are equal . Clusters led by CFOs and Directors exhibit the highest subsequent returns . The CFO knows the numbers Directors see the strategy . When they move together it ’ s a highconviction signal . The Filter Ignoring the Noise 90 % of insider transactions are noise . To find the alpha you have to filter aggressively . Here are the three specific filters I use 1 . Ignore Routine Trades We are looking for Opportunistic Traders . If a CEO buys stock every January 15th for tax reasons that trade contains zero information . You want to see trades that break a pattern . 2 . The Buy High Anomaly Conventional wisdom says buy low . However research by Li Wang Yan and Zhang 2019 uncovered a powerful anomaly Insiders who buy at 52week highs significantly outperform those who buy at 52week lows . The Logic This is called overcoming Anchoring Bias . Psychologically it is painful to buy a stock that has already rallied 30 % . If an insider buys at a 52week high they are fighting human nature . They are only doing this because they possess private information suggesting the stock is going significantly higher . A High Buy is a massive confidence signal . 3 . The NotSold Signal Sometimes the best signal is what insiders dont do . DeVault Cederburg and Wang 2021 analyzed Portfolio Insiders directors who sit on multiple boards . The Signal If a Director sits on the board of Company A and Company B and they sell Company A but hold Company B the NotSold stock Company B significantly outperforms the market . If you see a Cluster Buy in a stock check if those insiders are selling their other holdings to fund it . That doubles the conviction . The Execution Rules of Engagement Finding the signal is only step one . Execution is where you make or lose money . Rule 1 Wait for Price Confirmation Insiders are notoriously early . They are value investors with infinite time horizons . You are not_ My Trigger I wait for the stock to reclaim the average price of the insiders purchase . The Logic If the CFO buys at $ 50 and the stock drops to $ 40 the market disagrees with him . I stay away . When the stock rallies back through $ 50 it confirms the Insider Floor is holding and momentum is aligning with the insiders view . Rule 2 Focus on Liquid Stocks Paradoxically insider trading signals are often stronger in liquid stocks . Research suggests insiders prefer liquid stocks because it is easier to hide their volume . A Cluster Buy in a highly liquid name often precedes a major move because they are confident the liquidity will absorb their entry before the news breaks . Rule 3 The Silent Exit Retail investors usually sell too early or too late . I watch the insiders . If they stop buying during a subsequent dip or if they start Routine selling into strength the edge is gone . Summary When the people running the company are aggressively buying up their own shares with their own cash especially at 52week highs it is the purest signal of value you can find . I track these Cluster Buys and publish a deepdive watchlist of the most significant ones every week ."

      "title": "GlobalFoundries $GFS has 101.25% Institutional Ownerships with 11.66% of the float short.",
      "selftext": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th, the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips, for $20B, that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them, which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $GFS, who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics, the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq. What left me dumbfounded, is why $GFS was trading flat on the news for the week, and looking deeper into the stock, I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th, a week before Nvidia buying Groq, there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares, that barely moved the stock at all on that date, wtf… I know Quad-witching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that don't necessarily affect the stock, but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock’s volume on Quad-witching… So, putting two and two together, someone *probably* knew Nvidia was buying Groq, and they used the Quad-Witching date to load the f’king boat on GlobalFoundries. A week after the Groq acquisition, $GFS finally started climbing rapidly, from $35, to over $48 on January 27th, before pulling back to its current price of $42.20. Why the curious delayed reaction to the move? I believe, because this stock is shorted to the gills, and *someone* can’t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out. One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $GFS is currently shorted, Institutions hold 101.25% of the float, while a whopping 11.66% of that float is short, which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi’s… For more confirmation that $GFS is dangerously shorted, on Dec 31st, just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals, Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere downgrading the stock, and dropping the stock nearly -4% on the day; instead of continuing its plunge, Bulls smelled blood in the water, and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $48 in less than a month. One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 4/17/26 $45 Calls for $5.2M, then sold it for $14.2M on the price surge, and then doubled down with 4/17 $55 Calls for nearly $10M! Clearly, they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 2/11, and that brings me to my first point of this post. Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI, so they spent $20B on Groq AI Chips, and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips; if you’re Nvidia, you’re not gonna spend $20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips, so the next logical investment for $NVDA, is to buy a stake in $GFS itself. That *MUST* be what that Options Whale is betting on, maybe an announcement on 2/11 earnings, and with $GFS so heavily shorted, this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $NVDA does intend to invest in $GFS. To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries, below is the Daily OnBalance Volume \\[OBV\\] chart (ignore all those black lines in the middle, those are my Intra-day trendlines), the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure, to nearly hitting its Dec’22 ATHs, before pulling back, but still staying above the Gann Fan, and breaking that downward trend in just a single month! $GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling, but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options, I believe Longs are betting on a run soon, with or without $NVDA buying a stake in $GFS, AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space, areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in. My position is 9 July 17th $45 Calls, wish my account were bigger……….. As always, this is not Financial Advice, don't blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet, this is all PURE speculation on my part.",

      "selftext_processed": "When it was announced that Nvidia bought Groq on Dec 24th the maker of SRAM heavy AI chips for $ 20B that piqued my interest and I looked into who fabs the chips for them which turned out to be GlobalFoundries $ GFS who were pivoting into being a Fab for chips suited for Physical AI and Robotics the same space Nvidia is looking to expand into with the acquisition of Groq . What left me dumbfounded is why $ GFS was trading flat on the news for the week and looking deeper into the stock I was completely shocked that on Dec 19th a week before Nvidia buying Groq there was a huge surge in volume of 52.58M shares that barely moved the stock at all on that date wtf… I know Quadwitching Options Expiration dates can produce large volumes that dont necessarily affect the stock but this was ridiculously abnormal compared to any other stock ’ s volume on Quadwitching… So putting two and two together someone probably knew Nvidia was buying Groq and they used the QuadWitching date to load the f ’ king boat on GlobalFoundries . A week after the Groq acquisition $ GFS finally started climbing rapidly from $ 35 to over $ 48 on January 27th before pulling back to its current price of $ 42.20 . Why the curious delayed reaction to the move I believe because this stock is shorted to the gills and someone can ’ t afford to let GlobalFoundries rise too high or risk being blown out . One quick look at Yahoo Finance shows just how much $ GFS is currently shorted Institutions hold 101.25 % of the float while a whopping 11.66 % of that float is short which explains why this stock has been so dead in the water for so long amidst the great AI Mania happening everywhere else in Semi ’ s… For more confirmation that $ GFS is dangerously shorted on Dec 31st just as GlobalFoundries was on the verge of breaking out above $ 35 and going bullish on the Daily MACD technicals Wedbush put out a hit piece out of nowhere_downgrading the stock and dropping the stock nearly 4 % on the day instead of continuing its plunge Bulls smelled blood in the water and the stock went on that huge rally all the way to $ 48 in less than a month . One notable Options bet during this surge was when a whale bought 41726 $ 45 Calls for $ 5.2M then sold it for $ 14.2M on the price surge and then doubled down with 417 $ 55 Calls for nearly $ 10M Clearly they are betting on a surge after Earnings on 211 and that brings me to my first point of this post . Nvidia is looking to aggressively expand into Robotics and Physical AI so they spent $ 20B on Groq AI Chips and GlobalFoundries manufactures their chips if you ’ re Nvidia you ’ re not_gonna spend $ 20B on a Chip Designer firm without having the capacity to aggressively scale out their chips so the next logical investment for $ NVDA is to buy a stake in $ GFS itself . That MUST be what that Options Whale is betting on maybe an announcement on 211 earnings and with $ GFS so heavily shorted this stock could absolutely go on an insane run as shorts cover if $ NVDA does intend to invest in $ GFS . To visualize just how insane the volume has been on GlobalFoundries below is the Daily OnBalance Volume OBV chart ignore all those black lines in the middle those are my Intraday trendlines the Volume has surged in a near Vertical line from the bottom of that descending Gann Fan Structure to nearly hitting its Dec ’ 22 ATHs before pulling back but still staying above the Gann Fan and breaking that downward trend in just a single month $ GFS shitting the bed amidst AI Mania has been baffling but with the sudden surge of Volume and Options I believe Longs are betting on a run soon with or without $ NVDA buying a stake in $ GFS AI is shifting to Robotics and the Physical space areas where GlobalFoundries specialize in . My position is 9 July 17th $ 45 Calls wish my account were bigger……… .. As always this is not_Financial Advice dont blame me if you lose tons of money on a reckless Options bet this is all PURE speculation on my part ."

Musk's satellite-based internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver, accounting for about 50% to 80% of the total, the people said. >The rapid launch of 9,500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the world's largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service. The internet service, along with government contracts associated with Starlink and military-grade satellite network Starshield, has generated key revenue to help fund development of the company's next-generation Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit. >The company bought $19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the direct-to-device market, in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal. >The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world, close to Musk's 55th birthday ‍on June 28, the ⁠people said. >Musk expects Starship, which has test-launched 11 times since 2023, to start launching payloads into space this year. The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠space-based AI data centers, a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the company's proposed merger with xAI.",

SpaceXs most recent ‌financials which have not_been previously reported led some banks to estimate that the company could raise more than $ 50 billion at a valuation exceeding $ 1.5 trillion said the people who asked not_to be named to discuss private conversations . Reuters reported on Thursday that SpaceX is also in talks with ⁠Musk ’ s artificial intelligence company xAI XAAI.PVT ‌about a merger ahead of the IPO . SpaceX did not_immediately return a request for comment . The profit figure was earnings before interest taxes depreciation and ‍amortization a key measure of operating performance . Musks satellitebased internet system Starlink is the main revenue driver accounting for about 50 % to 80 % of the total the people said . The rapid launch of 9500 Starlink ​satellites since 2019 has made SpaceX the worlds largest satellite operator with over 9 ‌million users of the broadband internet service . The internet service along with government contracts associated with Starlink and militarygrade satellite network Starshield has generated key revenue to help fund development of the companys nextgeneration Starship rocket that Musk wants to use to loft more powerful Starlinks into orbit . The company bought $ 19 billion worth of wireless spectrum rights from EchoStar last year ⁠as it expands Starlink into the directtodevice market in ​which mobile phones can connect directly with Starlink satellites ​without the need for a Starlink user terminal . The satellite and rocket company is planning the biggest IPO in the world close to Musks 55th birthday ‍on June 28 the ⁠people said . Musk expects Starship which has testlaunched 11 times since 2023 to start launching payloads into space this year . The billionaire expects to use Starship to eventually launch ⁠spacebased AI data centers a risky and nascent pursuit tied to the companys proposed merger with xAI ."

      "selftext": "I’m actually gonna lose it if I hear one more person just dismiss someone else’s investment thesis with “it’s already priced in.” It’s probably not. And the meme of things always being priced in comes from the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which is an academic theory adjacent to Modern Portfolio Theory, which itself has been bastardized and misappropriated by many “investors” online. So here’s a quick rundown on it from someone who actually knows what it is, what it’s used for, and why it does not mean you can’t be a successful active retail trader. EMH argues that asset prices reflect all available info. There are three forms of EMH: strong, semi-strong, weak. Weak form argues that technical analysis is useless. This is somewhat true IMO, but support/resistance, volume spikes, relative strength, and moving averages are useful. Semi-strong form argues that fundamental analysis is useless, which is just blatantly untrue. The market is often slow to react and there are God knows how many examples of people catching things early. I’ve done, you’ve done it, and institutions certainly have done it. Strong form argues that insider trading is useless and I don’t even think I need to expand on how untrue that is. Now, does that mean I’m dismissing EMH and its creator as stupid? Of course not. EMH was created by Eugene Fama, and his name speaks for itself. Among his many accomplishments, he created the Fama-French model, which has also been bastardized by “investors” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101: it’s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations, before you teach them (or they learn themselves) that real life is messy. EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines, that irrational behavior is totally random, and that if a price does get irrational, smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be. In reality, none of this is true. If this were true, we never would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022. It also assumes that there are no asymmetries in access to information, and that trading is frictionless - no costs, no tax, and instant. Bottom line: yes it’s hard to beat the market. You won’t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers. EMH explains why markets are hard to beat. But it’s a classroom model, not real life.",

So here ’ s a quick rundown on it from someone who actually knows what it is what it ’ s used for and why it does not_mean you can ’ t be a successful active retail trader . EMH argues that asset prices reflect all available info . There are three forms of EMH strong semistrong weak . Weak form argues that technical analysis is useless . This is somewhat true IMO but supportresistance volume spikes relative strength and moving averages are useful . Semistrong form argues that fundamental analysis is useless which is just blatantly untrue . The market is often slow to react and there are God knows how many examples of people catching things early . I ’ ve done you ’ ve done it and institutions certainly have done it . Strong form argues that insider trading is useless and I don ’ t even think I need to expand on how untrue that is . Now does that mean I ’ m dismissing EMH and its creator as stupid Of course not_EMH was created by Eugene Fama and his name speaks for itself . Among his many accomplishments he created the FamaFrench model which has also been bastardized by “ investors ” who go on and on about factor tilts and diversifying just to end up investing in VT. EMH is like rational choice theory in Econ 101 it ’ s a baseline framework under which you teach students the foundations before you teach them or they learn themselves that real life is messy . EMH assumes that investors are all rational wealth maximizing machines that irrational behavior is totally random and that if a price does get irrational smart money immediately steps in to move it back to where it should be . In reality none of this is true . If this were true we never_would have had 2008 or even minor corrections like 2022 . It also assumes that there are no_asymmetries in access to information and that trading is frictionless no_costs no_tax and instant . Bottom line yes it ’ s hard to beat the market . You won ’ t beat it by blindly trading trending tickers . EMH explains why markets are hard to beat . But it ’ s a classroom model not_real life ."

      "selftext": "Most of my retirement is in ETFs and such but I do have a good amount in single stocks that I actively manage. My largest position is a stock that is currently trading at around $136/share. I own about 150 shares with a cost basis of around $120. As of today It’s down over the last year (-3%) but has trading as high as \\~$150 just a month or so ago. It’s biopharma so volatility is pretty common. I’m still very bullish on the stock as I’m familiar with their products, pipeline, and upcoming catalysts (I work in the industry). That said, I’m wondering if it makes sense to replace 100 of those shares with a LEAP (furthest out right now is December). I’m thinking deep ITM like $80 (breakeven at the current ask would be +3%). Note that these are long positions for me so they do have long term capital gains tax status should I sell.",

As of today It ’ s down over the last year 3 % but has trading as high as $ 150 just a month or so ago . It ’ s biopharma so volatility is pretty common . I ’ m still very bullish on the stock as I ’ m familiar with their products pipeline and upcoming catalysts I work in the industry . That said I ’ m wondering if it makes sense to replace 100 of those shares with a LEAP furthest out right now is December . I ’ m thinking deep ITM like $ 80 breakeven at the current ask would be 3 % . Note that these are long positions for me so they do have long term capital gains tax status should I sell ."

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, staying fully invested is often treated as the default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over long horizons, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally maintain a degree of flexibility through modest allocations to cash or short-duration assets. This can allow rebalancing, deployment during drawdowns, or reduced forced selling during periods of market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it may also affect risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is structured and used. From a portfolio construction standpoint, how do you think about this tradeoff? Do you view flexibility as a form of risk management, or as an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? How do you approach this in practice over full market cycles.?",

      "selftext": "The entire financial industry is built on the idea that government bonds are risk free. It is the foundation of the 60/40 portfolio and the standard advice for anyone seeking safety. I checked several academic research papers and the historical data paints a very different picture **1. The inflation tax** Simply, nominal returns are guaranteed but real returns are not. Research from Robeco on the Bond Winter shows that during inflationary spikes like the 1970s and 2020s, bond investors suffered real drawdowns between 30% and 50%. That is a crash, not capital preservation. **2. Duration volatility** Similar to stocks, when interset rates rise, prices fall. The Manhattan Institute notes that long duration bonds can experience volatility that rivals equities. If you bought long duration treasuries in 2020 for safety, you saw your principal collapse in 2022 **3. The soft default** We assume sovereigns always pay. Data from the Bank of England shows that 75% of sovereigns have defaulted since 1960. Developed nations do not default by refusing to pay. They default by printing money and diluting the currency you are holding. So if risk free rate is not risk free, why do we need it? So we can at least benchmark our returns to something?",

It is the foundation of the 6040 portfolio and the standard advice for anyone seeking safety . I checked several academic research papers and the historical data paints a very different picture 1 . The inflation tax Simply nominal returns are guaranteed but real returns are not_Research from Robeco on the Bond Winter shows that during inflationary spikes like the 1970s and 2020s bond investors suffered real drawdowns between 30 % and 50 % . That is a crash not_capital preservation . 2 . Duration volatility Similar to stocks when interset rates rise prices fall . The Manhattan Institute notes that long duration bonds can experience volatility that rivals equities . If you bought long duration treasuries in 2020 for safety you saw your principal collapse in 2022 3 . The soft default We assume sovereigns always pay . Data from the Bank of England shows that 75 % of sovereigns have defaulted since 1960 . Developed nations do not_default by refusing to pay . They default by printing money and diluting the currency you are holding . So if risk free rate is not_risk free why do we need it So we can at least benchmark our returns to something"

      "selftext": "What’s everyone’s take on Monday’s market after Friday’s selloff? The silver crash especially stood out to me. It felt less like fundamentals breaking and more like forced selling and leverage getting unwound. CME margin increase mandate was the main reason. So, big guys messed up and now this shutdown again. Because of that, I’m leaning toward more correction and chop, similar to what we saw around the November shutdown. I’m not rushing to buy the first bounce. If anything, I’ll be watching for another flush and looking at quality names or assets that were sold for liquidity rather than because something actually broke. Curious if others are expecting continuation lower or stabilization next week. What’s the Best Buys/targets right now. I also am in NBIS with lot of margin. So, will you say hold or sell. My average is 1000@112. This play is troubling me a lot. It’s having very weak price action right now.",

Gold margins will increase to 8 % of value of underlying contract from the present 6 % for nonheightened risk profile the exchange said on Friday . It added that the heightened risk profile margins would rise to 8.8 % from the present 6.6 . Silver margins will increase to 15 % from the present 11 % for the nonheightened risk profile . Meanwhile the heightened risk profile margins will witness a hike to 16.5 % from the present 12.1 % as per the statement . Platinum and palladium futures ’ margin also will be boosted . The change takes effect from Monday ’ s close and follows a “ normal review of market volatility to ensure adequate collateral coverage ” it said . The increase means those who want to trade futures of gold silver platinum and palladium will need to put up more collateral to ensure they can meet their obligations . While the exchange routinely raises margins when a contract is soaring sliding or extremely volatile Friday ’ s move could further edge out smaller players who don ’ t have enough cash to make the necessary deposits . Earlier this week the exchange hiked margins for silver platinum and palladium futures following price surges ."

The question is: Is the market ready for it? And is this a strategic move planned for sometime, or a pivot necessitated by plummeting Tesla EV sales? \\- Total automotive revenues dropped -11% YoY \\- 25Q4 Vehicle deliveries down -16% Yet somehow, despite plummeting auto sales, and pivot to an unproven market - that is not forecasting sales until 2027 - the stock continues to climb.

The question is Is the market ready for it And is this a strategic move planned for sometime or a pivot necessitated by plummeting Tesla EV sales Total automotive revenues dropped 11 % YoY 25Q4 Vehicle deliveries down 16 % Yet somehow despite plummeting auto sales and pivot to an unproven market that is not_forecasting sales until 2027 the stock continues to climb .

      "selftext": "*I've been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff, safe haven dumps, and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding.* *Needless to say, it's been fascinating, and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean, and organising a structural engineer for my house on the \"next week\" backburner.* So what's new? **Key points:** \\- Fed Chairman Warsh appointment: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday. He is a known hawk; his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort, tending toward short-term interest rate drops while maintaining long-term raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric. \\- Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday, January 28, stating the U.S. is not planning to intervene, indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis. \\- The Yen reached a critical low point this week, testing the 158-159 range (closing Friday at 154.73). Any further drops become an un-ignorable domestic cost of living issue, and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160. \\- Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5% (down from 2.0%), virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan (BoJ) rate intervention, as rates remain pinned at 0.75%. \\- US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0% line (the 30-year ended Friday at 4.87%), a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse. \\- Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent; the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday, February 2, with auctions to follow. **The crossroads?** The carry trade needs to unwind, as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward, whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward. However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse. **Avenues?** A. The Fed could print USD to buy Yen, however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood, with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese. B. The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen, however recent economic figures (1.5% CPI) rule this out as a short-term possibility, and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind. C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency, via deploying USD cash reserves of \\~$160.4 Billion (held as deposits at the Fed), or selling T-bills/notes/bonds from their $1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen. As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now, leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages. A T-bill (short-term), T-note and bond (long term) sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows, and send US Bond yields soaring, sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse, particular in longer term treasuries. Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets, spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance. This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds, banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings, crypto typically first, high risk stocks, and then precious metals (as seen in Friday's sharp gold sell-off). As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic, even for gold and silver, is seldom a good bet. Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail, as cash (USD/EUR/YEN) currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle. I suspect metals will find a floor, however commodities are not my turf so I'll let others do the deeper commentary there. **The remaining option?** There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover. The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF, strengthening the Yen, triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short positions, and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned, whilst also not crushing the carry trade. Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed, the carry trade is not crushed and can slowly unwind, and global stock markets grind on higher. However what happens next remains to be seen, and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls. \\--- Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀",

      "selftext_processed": "Ive been following with keen interest the recent events and wanted to provide some commentary on the liquidity cliff safe haven dumps and pending tightrope course the global economics need to navigate in order to execute a smooth transition without a mass financial disaster unfolding . Needless to say its been fascinating and this has left me putting my driveway that needs a clean and organising a structural engineer for my house on the next week backburner . So whats new Key points Fed Chairman Warsh appointment President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on Friday . He is a known hawk his appointment signals a loss of the Fed as a buyer of last resort tending toward shortterm interest rate drops while maintaining longterm raised rates and strong Dollar rhetoric . Treasury Secretary Bessent provided verbiage on Wednesday January 28 stating the U.S. is not_planning to intervene indicating a significantly reduced likelihood of U.S. support in the USDYEN crisis . The Yen reached a critical low point this week testing the 158159 range closing Friday at 154.73 . Any further drops become an unignorable domestic cost of living issue and intervention becomes practically mandatory past 160 . Tokyo inflation CPI released on Friday proved cooler than usual at 1.5 % down from 2.0 % virtually ruling out interest rate hikes and Yen strengthening via Bank of Japan BoJ rate intervention as rates remain pinned at 0.75 % . US Bond yields are skirting the dangerous 5.0 % line the 30year ended Friday at 4.87 % a threshold past which mortgages and the market suffer immense stress and collapse . Quarterly Bond issuance is imminent the U.S. Treasury will release its financing requirements on Monday February 2 with auctions to follow . The crossroads The carry trade needs to unwind as the path of least resistance for the Yen is upward whilst the path of least resistance for the USD is downward . However this needs to occur in an orderly fashion to prevent financial system collapse . Avenues A . The Fed could print USD to buy Yen however Warsh as an appointee reduces this likelihood with White House rhetoric indicating nil intervention and placing the burden back on the Japanese . B . The Japanese could raise rates to strengthen the Yen however recent economic figures 1.5 % CPI rule this out as a shortterm possibility and raising rates would trigger a more violent unwind . C. The Japanese can directly intervene in the currency via deploying USD cash reserves of $ 160.4 Billion held as deposits at the Fed or selling Tbillsnotesbonds from their $ 1.003 Trillion stockpile to buy back Yen . As far as we can see options A and B appear largely off the table for now leaving the most viable being option C. However the three various methods there have their advantages and disadvantages . A Tbill shortterm Tnote and bond long term sell off by the Ministry of Finance would cause diplomatic rows and send US Bond yields soaring sparking a severe risk of US economic collapse particular in longer term treasuries . Whilst this provides Japan with a surefire way out of the Yen concerns it would ultimately result in ruin of the US markets spark a deep recession and sever economic and diplomatic ties and create a rift in the G7 alliance . This is the current risk being priced into the markets as hedge funds banks and other financial institutions derisk their holdings crypto typically first high risk stocks and then precious metals as seen in Fridays sharp gold selloff . As I may have previously commented hedging into a parabolic even for gold and silver is seldom a good bet . Institutions bought early and have dumped it onto retail as cash USDEURYEN currently rules king as the default margin loan repayment vehicle . I suspect metals will find a floor however commodities are not_my turf so Ill let others do the deeper commentary there . The remaining option There is a tightrope to be walked where everyone walks out unscathed and the market recover . The sell off of USD cash reserves by the Japanese MoF strengthening the Yen triggering a short squeeze and liquidation cascade of short positions and returning the Yen to a place of value where domestic interests are aligned whilst also not_crushing the carry trade . Here the US yields remain minimally perturbed the carry trade is not_crushed and can slowly unwind and global stock markets grind on higher . However what happens next remains to be seen and the massive risk of anything other than this balanced tightrope is currently being priced in as institutions move to cash to mitigate margin calls . Best of luck to everyone navigating this dumpster fire 🍀"

      "selftext": "**TL,DR/Summary:** Today, the silver price dropped \\~30%, an event unseen in about 15 years. This may not be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9% and/or Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair. A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in today's sell-off. I gathered a timeline of recent events before today's historic crash in silver price. I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the US-dollar index gaining 0.9% is at least incomplete (and at most a smokescreen). **Timeline** * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group switches from a fixed-dollar margin per contract to a 9% percentage margin ([PDF source]( Hence, traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price * 13 Jan 2026: CME Group announces new 100-ounce **cash-settled** futures * 27 Jan 2026: CME group increases the margin requirement from 9% to 11% ([PDF source]( forcing more traders to liquidate * 28 Jan 2026: ex-JPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50% drop in silver price ([source]( JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF * 29 Jan 2026: Still, silver hits an all time high at around $121 * 30 Jan 2026: Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair, and the USD index gains 0.9%. This is the narrative for silver plummeting \\~30% in one day. However, historically, hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere near a comparable sell-off **The COMEX Physical Silver Problem** CME group, as of 30 Jan 2026, reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces ([Silver Stocks Excel file]( The March silver future open interest, however, is roughly 490m ounces (source: [open interest 98k](#tradeDate=20260129), where each contract is for 5k ounces). Hence, it will be disastrous for COMEX if \\~22% of March future holders demand physical delivery. They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions. Likewise, bullion banks that sold these future contracts (and are short silver), would be able to maintain their short positions, avoid catastrophic losses, and gain massively. I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash. What's your take on this, and what does it mean for the silver price? Cheers -",

      "selftext_processed": "TLDRSummary Today the silver price dropped 30 % an event unseen in about 15 years . This may not_be due to the dollar index increasing by 0.9 % andor Kevin Warsh being nominated to become the next FED chair . A synthesis of events leading up to the crash points towards COMEX silver deposit dynamics and bullion banks short positions to play a role in todays selloff . I gathered a timeline of recent events before todays historic crash in silver price . I think the notion of a new FED nominee or the USdollar index gaining 0.9 % is at least incomplete and at most a smokescreen . Timeline 13 Jan 2026 CME Group switches from a fixeddollar margin per contract to a 9 % percentage margin PDF source Hence traders can now get liquidated on the sole basis of an increasing silver price 13 Jan 2026 CME Group announces new 100ounce cashsettled futures 27 Jan 2026 CME group increases the margin requirement from 9 % to 11 % PDF source forcing more traders to liquidate 28 Jan 2026 exJPM researcher Marko Kolanovic forecasts a 50 % drop in silver price source JPM is the primary custodian for the SLV ETF 29 Jan 2026 Still silver hits an all time high at around $ 121 30 Jan 2026 Trump nominees a hawkish FED chair and the USD index gains 0.9 % . This is the narrative for silver plummeting 30 % in one day . However historically hawkish interest rate statements or USD appreciation came nowhere_near a comparable selloff The COMEX Physical Silver Problem CME group as of 30 Jan 2026 reports registered silver deposits of 105m ounces Silver Stocks Excel file The March silver future open interest however is roughly 490m ounces source open interest 98ktrade Date20260129 where each contract is for 5k ounces . Hence it will be disastrous for COMEX if 22 % of March future holders demand physical delivery . They should therefore have an interest in futures holders liquidating their positions . Likewise bullion banks that sold these future contracts and are short silver would be able to maintain their short positions avoid catastrophic losses and gain massively . I doubt the announcement of a new FED Chair nominee is solely responsible for the crash . Whats your take on this and what does it mean for the silver price Cheers"

I've done moderately well this past year, mostly just the market doing what it's doing, but I've made a few good choices and some other \"learning experiences\" I'm wondering, how can I improve my strategy for stop losses while capitalizing on the greatest amount of gain possible? I don't have the time or commitment to watch my holdings every minute. I want to have a better system of when I enter a position, setting up appropriate stops and also conditional trades so that I can take advantage of upswings but don't get burnt by sell offs. Is it advisable strategy to set up conditional trades such as this: if you enter at $100 for example, set up a cobditional trade such that if the stock dips past - 3% below it's 30-day high, it triggers a market sale. Something like that? Or what conditional trades do you use when you enter a position?",

      "selftext": "I track my percentage return from dividends as a percentage. Stock prices changes and so, the percentage changes. I track the earnings percentage in two columns; one for my purchase price and one for the rate at the current day's price. Weirdly, I view my dividend annual interest rate differently, depending on whether the stock price is up or down. For example, I bought CVX at $136 last June when the rate was 5%. At today's price ($176.90), the rate is 3.87%. I still \"think\" that my \"original\" money is earning 5%. On the other hand, I bought RA at $21.18, now at $13.02 but I \"think\" that my earnings rate is 6.69%, even though someone buying today would be earning 10.88% per year. My original RA investment, much of it lost, is earning at the lower rate. Should I be thinking of things differently? It doesn't seem to make much sense to use both the \"my cost\" rate and the \"current price rate, depending on whether I \"won\" or \"lost\" on the original purchase price.",

I track the earnings percentage in two columns one for my purchase price and one for the rate at the current days price . Weirdly I view my dividend annual interest rate differently depending on whether the stock price is up or down . For example I bought CVX at $ 136 last June when the rate was 5 % . At todays price $ 176.90 the rate is 3.87 % . I still think that my original money is earning 5 % . On the other hand I bought RA at $ 21.18 now at $ 13.02 but I think that my earnings rate is 6.69 % even though someone buying today would be earning 10.88 % per year . My original RA investment much of it lost is earning at the lower rate . Should I be thinking of things differently It doesnt seem to make much sense to use both the my cost rate and the current price rate depending on whether I won or lost on the original purchase price ."

      "selftext": "Briefings from Goldman Sachs: Gold has capped off a huge 2025 rally with a blazing start to 2026. While prices declined in early trading on Friday, Anshul Sehgal, global co-head of Fixed Income, Currency and Commodities in Goldman Sachs Global Banking & Markets, says the precious metal could continue to rise. The main driver of the move has been global central banks’ shift from the US dollar to precious metals, Sehgal says. “These are tiny markets compared to global stocks or fixed income, so the smallest change in demand makes prices go parabolic. Sehgal that only about 5% of the world’s gold is currently held by speculators. “If a central bank decides they want to pivot away from the dollar and own more gold, that is going to move the price quite violently. Which is what we're observing.” For this reason, Sehgal is skeptical of arguments that gold is currently being driven by speculative mania. “We think this is a multi-decade trajectory,\" he says. He adds that gold “barely moved” from 2010 to 2020 even as growth-oriented stocks surged, which means the recent move can partially be categorized as a catch-up. “Do we expect gold to continue to appreciate exponentially as it has? No. But we’re not fussed about there being a lot of froth when it comes to precious metals,” he says.",

Possible catalysts new fed chair expected to be responsible about protecting the dollar iran war deescalation unreasonably steep run up in the last week My read on the situation the price is the consensus reached by many different players most of the players in the US market are speculators without a fundamental or industrial reason for trading . They either panic sold or got margin called deepening the crash . In the Asian market however there are institutions and governments who have a strategic or long term reason to buy especially when they get a discount . They will be voting and primary driver of the monday opening price since time zone is ahead for asia . So I am expecting a gap up and I bought both GLD and SLV calls right before close on Friday . TLDR US specular ’ s job is to predict the asian metal market driven by fundamentals so large moves during nyse trading hours are a false signal serious price discovery is going to happen with American markets closed .

      "selftext": "Been digging into Microsoft's financials beyond the usual revenue and EPS numbers, and wanted to share some observations that caught my attention from a value perspective. I used \\[thefinbase\\]( to pull together this data for my risk analysis before I buy this stock and \\[tradingview\\]( for financial information it has the best UI . No affiliation with these two just revealing my sources. Now let’s get going: Balance Sheet Shifting Toward Less Flexible Assets Property, plant, and equipment increased nearly 50% in a single year (from \\\\\\~$155B to \\\\\\~$230B). That's a massive tilt toward long duration, non liquid assets. Meanwhile, depreciation jumped from $22B to $34B. In a sector where hardware can become obsolete quickly, this concentration in physical infrastructure creates impairment exposure if tech refresh cycles accelerate. Some Interesting Liability Movement \"Other Current Liabilities\" increased 45% year over year. Without detailed disclosure, this likely includes unearned cloud billings and similar obligations. Worth monitoring because rapid buildup in prepayment dependency can distort cash flow timing if customer behavior shifts. The Segment Concentration Factor Intelligent Cloud now drives roughly 40% of revenue with 29% growth, while More Personal Computing actually declined 3%. This isn't necessarily bad, but it does mean any cloud cyclicality hits the overall business harder than it would have five years ago. The Sentiment Disconnect Despite record profits, shares declined after strong Q2 results. When markets sell the news on beat and raise quarters, it often signals expectations have gotten ahead of near term reality. None of this means the investment thesis is broken. Microsoft remains a dominant business. But as value investors, we're supposed to see what others miss and understand what we're actually paying for at current multiples. Even with these risks I still think it's a good stock to buy, especially in its role as the AI boom continues. What do you think ?",

      "selftext": "I am an ignorant anonymous, I surely know less than you, but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today. **What happened today?** Everything went to shit: gold, silver, major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit. **What does this mean?** The market received a necessary correction. After gold and silver rose savagely these days, a lot of last-minute leveraged money was absorbed. I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop: 1. **Options Expiration:** Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed. With gold at **5,500 USD**, profit-taking was factual. Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits, and thus generated downward pressure. 2. **Trump's move with Kevin Warsh:** Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed. On paper, he is a \"HAWK\" (strong dollar, high rates, and low inflation). That's why the market ran to bonds and punished stocks/gold for fear of liquidity being cut. **My opinion:** Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not long ago. For me, Warsh is a puppet: they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House. Under this thesis, when he comes to power in May, Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending. The dollar will continue to lose value, gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks, and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate (congratulations if you held emerging market bonds). But if you don't believe me even in the worst-case scenario, boys: the decay of Fiat is not fixed with a change of names. Hold your equities and don't let yourselves be scared.",

      "selftext_processed": "I am an ignorant anonymous I surely know less than you but I am here to offer my analysis of what happened today . What happened today Everything went to shit gold silver major ETFs went down and US bonds rose a bit . What does this mean The market received a necessary correction . After gold and silver rose savagely these days a lot of lastminute leveraged money was absorbed . I believe there are 2 key reasons for this drop 1 . Options Expiration Today is the last Friday of the month and thousands of contracts were closed . With gold at 5500 USD profittaking was factual . Those who received physical or closed positions sold to take profits and thus generated downward pressure . 2 . Trumps move with Kevin Warsh Trump nominated Warsh for the Fed . On paper he is a HAWK strong dollar high rates and low inflation . Thats why the market ran to bonds and punished stocksgold for fear of liquidity being cut . My opinion Kevin Warsh has been a critic of Powell in recent times and supported lowering rates not_long ago . For me Warsh is a puppet they nominate him to hide that the Fed is no_longer independent and that it will respond directly to the White House . Under this thesis when he comes to power in May Warsh will dedicate himself to lowering rates and printing to fund spending . The dollar will continue to lose value gold will continue its upward trend along with stocks and US bonds will be negligible with the new rate congratulations if you held emerging market bonds . But if you dont believe me even in the worstcase scenario boys the decay of Fiat is not_fixed with a change of names . Hold your equities and dont let yourselves be scared ."

      "selftext": "I’d a few weeks ago before the CFO stepped down made a post telling people to buy TTD. I did a post like this because the financials looked unbelievably good for that price. I’d originally thought it was beat down and far over corrected….Then I got to witness first handedly how incompetent the CEO Is. What happened? The CFO suddenly stepped down… management reiterated their financials but with lack luster detail. It dropped 20percent in 5 days. So what did management do? Well I sent and Email asking about the situation and if everything is going well with the company and I’d gotten 0 response within 2 business days. Additionally the CEO who once said “communication with investors is key” is MIA as if the company doesn’t matter I learned an important lesson that I think is value-able Who the CEO is can make a company or break one. Jeff Green The CEO is worth 2.6Billion dollars. TTD has a 15B market cap that just took a 80percent haircut from the highs. Do you think Jeff The Douche Green bought any shares? Nope in the past 2 years all he’s done is sold. This is why I sold out of my position upon realizing my mistake. For Reference if you’re the owner of your own business and you have 260,000$ and you truly believe your company is worth far more than this you’d buy of course. You can see the financials and should be confident in how you’re operating the company…. Now imagine me as the CEO and owner refusing to even purchase even 260$ of shares. That is Jeff Green. Jeff Green is an example of a CEO that looks at the business as a job. How unbelievably disappointing pathetically and selfish Edit: this is the 3rd CFO to step down, if the CFO is stepping down and Multi Billionaire Jeff Green who can see the financials isn’t buying any stock it tell you everything you need to know. ***AI “As of early 2026, Jeffrey T. Green, CEO of The Trade Desk, has an estimated net worth between $2.3 billion and over $6 billion. His wealth is primarily derived from his ownership of The Trade Desk (TTD) stock and his massive 2022 stock option package”***",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ d a few weeks ago before the CFO stepped down made a post telling people to buy TTD . I did a post like this because the financials looked unbelievably good for that price . I ’ d originally thought it was beat down and far over corrected….Then I got to witness first handedly how incompetent the CEO Is . What happened The CFO suddenly stepped down… management reiterated their financials but with lack luster detail . It dropped 20percent in 5 days . So what did management do Well I sent and Email asking about the situation and if everything is going well with the company and I ’ d gotten 0 response within 2 business days . Additionally the CEO who once said “ communication with investors is key ” is MIA as if the company doesn ’ t matter I learned an important lesson that I think is valueable Who the CEO is can make a company or break one . Jeff Green The CEO is worth 2.6Billion dollars . TTD has a 15B market cap that just took a 80percent haircut from the highs . Do you think Jeff The Douche Green bought any shares Nope in the past 2 years all he ’ s done is sold . This is why I sold out of my position upon realizing my mistake . For Reference if you ’ re the owner of your own business and you have 260000 $ and you truly believe your company is worth far more than this you ’ d buy of course . You can see the financials and should be confident in how you ’ re operating the company… . Now imagine me as the CEO and owner refusing to even purchase even 260 $ of shares . That is Jeff Green . Jeff Green is an example of a CEO that looks at the business as a job . How unbelievably disappointing pathetically and selfish Edit this is the 3rd CFO to step down if the CFO is stepping down and Multi Billionaire Jeff Green who can see the financials isn ’ t buying any stock it tell you everything you need to know . AI “ As of early 2026 Jeffrey T. Green CEO of The Trade Desk has an estimated net worth between $ 2.3 billion and over $ 6 billion . His wealth is primarily derived from his ownership of The Trade Desk TTD stock and his massive 2022 stock option package ”"

      "selftext": "When my husband died a few years ago, I became sole owner of his brokerage account. He was pretty casual about his stocks and didn't have the date of acquisition for many of them. He was a \"buy and hold\" guy, or \"inherit and hold.\" Upon my death, the account will go to a charity that was important to my husband. We were each other's second spouse. He had no children. I transfer regular earnings to my account and use the money for whatever I want -- living expenses, house repairs, investment. Occasionally, however, one of his stocks will disappear and leave a pile of money in the sweep account. (Yes, the company is acquired by another entity or whatever.) I take that money and invest in other stocks for his account, using my own research and recommendations from the brokerkage. Here's my question: Should I do some research to find out when he acquired the stocks for which I have no date of acquisition? If so, how would I do that? I know that he acquired some of the stocks in the Seventies, and some he probably had had since he was a child, so they are almost certainly considered long-term investments. Thanks very much for your help. I frequent some other Reddit boards but had not thought to come here until I happened upon this board today.",

      "selftext": "Reddit (RDDT) stock has been pretty volatile lately after pulling back from a recent high, supposedly driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. There’s still a lot of bullish sentiment, with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $320 based on strong user growth and AI integration. *“… driven by an analyst’s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition.”* Competition from what exactly? TikTok? The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons? Or Snap? The app that’s been effectively dead for years? I’ll leave Meta out of this because I don’t think it even needs addressing. The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms. Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would’ve made more sense for a bullish case. Not sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things. Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher, showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair, Warsh. (Who knows, I’m not taking a stance there.) The point is, there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026, so how does that square with fears (atop of the previous points) of declining ad growth? Between Reddit ads, its growing presence in search results, AI integration, and highly targeted user interests, Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI. There’s also the new verified profile feature, which could end up being meaningful long-term, even for marketing purposes. All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me. There’s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which, honestly, should be another sign. Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5, 2026. I’ve recently been questioning that specific analyst, why there was such a reaction from it, but perhaps I had missed something on my end. **P.S.** To everyone about to yell “it’s nothing but bots!” Yeah, there are bots everywhere among all platforms. However, you’d be surprised how many users *aren’t* bots. This gives me the same energy as people saying “that must be AI!” when it clearly isn’t. Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now. I’ve watched people Google something, scroll straight past everything else, click the Reddit result to get their answer. They would also casually notice an ad while they’re there. That feels - important. **Edit:** I originally wrote this on the fly, but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point. I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below, which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one! **Edit:** There are many great points below. I agree with some of the concerns drawn, but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent, and very suddenly, selloff. **Edit:** I Love all the banbets below! Yep. I’m in for *banbet RDDT 195 1w.* I guess I’m riding with you, u/Sweg_OG",

      "selftext_processed": "Reddit RDDT stock has been pretty volatile lately after pulling back from a recent high supposedly driven by an analyst ’ s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition . There ’ s still a lot of bullish sentiment with some analysts throwing out price targets as high as $ 320 based on strong user growth and AI integration . “ … driven by an analyst ’ s concerns around 2026 ad growth and competition. ” Competition from what exactly TikTok The app people are actively leaving for a variety of reasons Or Snap The app that ’ s been effectively dead for years I ’ ll leave Meta out of this because I don ’ t think it even needs addressing . The analyst who took this stance baffles me due to the fact that this year is midterms . Ad growth during midterms and political volatility would ’ ve made more sense for a bullish case . Not_sure what they were looking at here overall on the grand scale of things . Gold and silver sold off today while the dollar moved a bit higher showing us a bit of optimism around the new Fed Chair Warsh . Who knows I ’ m not_taking a stance there . The point is there does seem to be broader optimism heading into 2026 so how does that square with fears atop of the previous points of declining ad growth Between Reddit ads its growing presence in search results AI integration and highly targeted user interests Reddit appears to be leaning harder into AI data licensing and improving its search UI . There ’ s also the new verified profile feature which could end up being meaningful longterm even for marketing purposes . All of this makes the current selloff feel pretty overblown to me . There ’ s also a lot of negative sentiment on Reddit right now about Reddit stock which honestly should be another sign . Reddit is scheduled to report earnings on February 5 2026 . I ’ ve recently been questioning that specific analyst why there was such a reaction from it but perhaps I had missed something on my end . P.S . To everyone about to yell “ it ’ s nothing_but bots ” Yeah there are bots everywhere among all platforms . However you ’ d be surprised how many users aren ’ t bots . This gives me the same energy as people saying “ that must be AI ” when it clearly isn ’ t . Everyone I talk to goes to Reddit for answers now . I ’ ve watched people Google something scroll straight past everything else click the Reddit result to get their answer . They would also casually notice an ad while they ’ re there . That feels important . Edit I originally wrote this on the fly but I made some grammatical edits and revised it a bit to drive my point . I made sure to keep all original parts given the great conversations below which I thank all of you for taking the time to discuss this one Edit There are many great points below . I agree with some of the concerns drawn but the strengths still seem to outweigh the weaknesses overall reaffirming my suspicion on this bullish position and this recent and very suddenly selloff . Edit I Love all the banbets below Yep . I ’ m in for banbet RDDT 195 1w . I guess I ’ m riding with you uSweg_OG"

      "selftext": "I am from India and want to invest globally via IBKR. I am looking for non-US domiciled accumulating UCITs only for easier tax purposes. I researched and made this PF for me: 70% ACWX - Developed Markets ex usa + Emerging markets 30% CSPX - Similar to S&P500. With this my idea is to reduce US concentration in my PF because World ETFs include >60% US. But the issue is ACWX is Nasdaq based ETF. Is anyone aware of any other alternative UCITs for ACWX ?? I know I can replicate ACWX via/from EXUS + EIMI but that would require a little more monitoring down the line. ACWX would have served the purpose just right but the only issue is that it is US domiciled. TLDR; I have 2 questions: 1) Is there any ACWX alternative, non US domiciled UCIT on IBKR? 2) How do I buy gold on ibkr? best etf?",

      "selftext": "I’m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I’m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense. Background: I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next \\~3 years. The trust is administered by a large, reputable law firm, and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates. From everything I can tell, this is a legitimate, professional setup and not anything sketchy. The trust uses an outside active equity manager. The proposed long-term allocation is roughly 80% equities and 20% cash (short-term needs), with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into \\~30–40 individual stocks. The stated goal is long-term investing with a “defensive” tilt: high-quality companies, low debt, strong balance sheets, some international exposure, and selective themes (e.g., infrastructure, electrification). The annual fee is \\~1.2% of the entire trust value (not just the invested portion). This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight. Trading costs are small, but the 1.2% applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash. I asked for historical performance, and I was shown a model trust portfolio (not my specific account) covering roughly 1998–2025. According to that report: • Total portfolio (stocks + bonds + cash): \\~8.3% annualized • Equity portion alone: \\~11.6% annualized Over the same period: • S&P 500: \\~9.4% • MSCI World: \\~8.3% The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes, while also being more defensive. However, once I factor in the 1.2% annual fee on the full trust, the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly \\~7.1%. That puts it roughly in line with (or slightly below) a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio, and clearly below the S&P 500 over the same horizon. Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach: • Index funds are “not necessarily low risk” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks. • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration. • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure. • The strategy has historically “participated less” during market declines. My concerns: • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing long-term risk. • The performance shown is from a model portfolio, which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias. • The equity outperformance looks good gross, but once the full trust fee is applied, it largely disappears. • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk, it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result. • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years, I’m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the long-term portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases. I’m not claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here. The trustee is experienced, properly credentialed, and works at a well-known firm. My question is more about the math and the assumptions. For those with experience in investing, finance, or trusts: • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test? • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this? • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns? • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for? Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ m looking for some objective feedback on an investment structure I ’ m currently in and whether the claims being made actually make sense . Background I have assets held in a trust that must remain in place for at least the next 3 years . The trust is administered by a large reputable law firm and one of the trustees is a senior attorney with decades of experience in trusts and estates . From everything I can tell this is a legitimate professional setup and not_anything sketchy . The trust uses an outside active equity manager . The proposed longterm allocation is roughly 80 % equities and 20 % cash shortterm needs with the equity portion invested gradually over 6–8 months into 30–40 individual stocks . The stated goal is longterm investing with a “ defensive ” tilt highquality companies low debt strong balance sheets some international exposure and selective themes e.g . infrastructure electrification . The annual fee is 1.2 % of the entire trust value not just the invested portion . This fee covers trustee services and investment oversight . Trading costs are small but the 1.2 % applies regardless of whether assets are in stocks or cash . I asked for historical performance and I was shown a model trust portfolio not my specific account covering roughly 1998–2025 . According to that report • Total portfolio stocks bonds cash 8.3 % annualized • Equity portion alone 11.6 % annualized Over the same period • SP 500 9.4 % • MSCI World 8.3 % The implication seems to be that this active equity approach has historically outperformed broad indexes while also being more defensive . However once I factor in the 1.2 % annual fee on the full trust the net return of the total portfolio drops to roughly 7.1 % . That puts it roughly in line with or slightly below a global index fund like VT after its tiny expense ratio and clearly below the SP 500 over the same horizon . Some of the arguments made in favor of this approach • Index funds are “ not necessarily low risk ” due to current concentration in a handful of large U.S. tech stocks . • Active selection reduces drawdowns by avoiding overconcentration . • Knowing what companies are owned and why is superior to passive exposure . • The strategy has historically “ participated less ” during market declines . My concerns • Index funds rebalance automatically and concentration has existed many times historically without permanently increasing longterm risk . • The performance shown is from a model portfolio which raises questions about selection bias and survivorship bias . • The equity outperformance looks good gross but once the full trust fee is applied it largely disappears . • If an active strategy truly beat global and U.S. indexes for nearly 30 years with lower risk it seems like that would be an extraordinary and very rare result . • Since the assets must stay in the trust for at least 3 more years I ’ m trying to determine whether this structure actually makes sense for the longterm portion versus something simpler and cheaper once flexibility increases . I ’ m not_claiming anyone is acting in bad faith here . The trustee is experienced properly credentialed and works at a wellknown firm . My question is more about the math and the assumptions . For those with experience in investing finance or trusts • Do these claims and returns pass the smell test • Am I missing something important about how to evaluate this • Is this just a case of paying for risk management and professional oversight rather than expecting higher returns • How would you think about this relative to a global index approach once fees are fully accounted for Appreciate any thoughtful perspectives ."

      "title": "Dollar Crashing. My Criticism of Public Perception",
      "selftext": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this: The dollar has always been crashing, but it really depends on what frame of view by which you're looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you. That's where we can have a debate. As you know, we've seen headlines about the dollar collapse, and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends. But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider: What makes this 'crash' any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced? Here's what you'll see folks point to: \\- Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency. \\-Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights. \\-Recent inflation has been exceptional, where aggregate prices are 26% higher today than in 2019-2020. \\-The DXY, a measure of our currency relative to a basket of first-world nations, has come down considerably \\-Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control This is what I'd like to point to: Nothing changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new. let's look at the above talking points one-by-one. **1) Dollar debasement; Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency & 2) The DXY has come down considerably** In recent history, it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade. Is this new? No. The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline. We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar, as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was *artificially* being stymied. Just like the OPEC-mandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s, we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar. Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage. You may argue \"But did our money supply not increase??\". The answer is yes. It did. But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world. Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty. Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not seen in decades. It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized. The advent of Trump's tariffs, like him or not, did add some fuel to the fire. Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here. China being a large proponent to this. Overall, you'll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runner-up. **Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights** The price increases of Gold/Silver have been often misread as \"this must mean the value of the dollar is falling\", when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is self-fulfilling. If people believe the sky is falling, they'll buy bunkers. It's not that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling. I've already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver, so I'll not stay too long on this one, but I want to point out that in the coming months, you may see the price stagnate then climb higher. You may also see it come crashing back down. Both events are equally likely. Fundamentally, however, I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not led by central banking or any monetary authority. We can check money flows. When we do this, we find that A) there's already been an industrial shortage for silver and B) This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own. If you use fund inflows to exchange-traded products backed by gold and silver, you see they've gone up by 20-30 fold. That's not nothing. That's behavioral and not fundamental. But let's go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things: 1) **current and expected CPI** 2) **Long term treasury yields** \\-The CPI expectation hovers at 2.7-3.2%. This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 50-60 years. As for Long term treasury yield, we use this figure because I don't want to open myself up to someone saying \"Well, the fed has been buying treasuries, so that decreases yields\". They would be right, but 10 and 30-yr terms are the exception. Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates. If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally, we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30-yr terms, pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations. We'd also see a really difficult auction. We haven't seen either. Right now, yields are 160 Bps below the 60-year average, and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong; evidenced by the 'bid-to-cover' ratio, which is actually within a normal range at **2.55**. **Our Debt/GDP Ratio is out of control** THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely. Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending. As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases, it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand. I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change. However, some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable Debt/GDP ratio. This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically under-paces the rate in which we accumulate public debt. Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the \"Dollar Crash\" concern: QE (Quantitative Easing). QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits. This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks. **So where are we really?** It's complicated. And the news doesn't help. The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s. I'll not lie to you and say everything is okay, but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not going away. We have a real problem with debt. It's growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt, each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nation's treasury. But here's the detail we can't miss: Our economy is capitalistic, not communistic. In a capitalist country, the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace. And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money, that skews inflation recognition. Not for capital assets but for consumables. We've seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras. 1) the easy-money policy when debt was near 0%. 2) During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the top-end of the economy. Hence the K-shaped recovery. This created asset inflation, and we can call it asset inflation because of how P/E ratios, (adjusted for earnings growth), have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages. Some of this is structural. Companies, today, are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history. That can pull-forward tomorrow's pricing to today. But that's an incomplete story. If we look at capital assets, they've outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply. That's where the **dollar's value 'plunging'** shows up. This leads me back to my overall argument. The dollar crisis shows up depending on where you're looking. Capping it all off, I'll leave you with this scenario: Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim. And let's say I print off $10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself (I would). By every measure, M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50%, but does this mean the dollar's purchasing power has been cut by 1/3? No. It's the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollar's loss of purchasing power. If I started to then spend that $10 Trillion, buy all the food from the shelves, feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price I'm paying, then you'd see inflation. **The rule:** In a true currency crisis, you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transaction-related friction. For many countries, companies and individuals, that currency is still the US Dollar. When you have dollars, convert your savings into productive assets. Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery. No other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does.",

      "selftext_processed": "Allow me to preface my analysis by saying this The dollar has always been crashing but it really depends on what frame of view by which youre looking at it to determine how much it really should matter to you . Thats where we can have a debate . As you know weve seen headlines about the dollar collapse and it has become quite a common fear among clients and friends . But I have a challenge for the rest of you to consider What makes this crash any different from the persistent crisis our dollar has experienced Heres what youll see folks point to Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights . Recent inflation has been exceptional where aggregate prices are 26 % higher today than in 20192020 . The DXY a measure of our currency relative to a basket of firstworld nations has come down considerably Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control This is what Id like to point to Nothing_changing about the dollar and its relevance are fundamentally new . lets look at the above talking points onebyone . 1 Dollar debasement Dollar is being dropped as a reserve currency 2 The DXY has come down considerably In recent history it is true that we are seeing declines in how the often the dollar is relied on to affect trade . Is this new No_The rate at which it has been losing volume on the global stage has remained largely consistent with a couple years after 2020 being the exception that offset this decline . We actually so more countries fleeing to the dollar as we were one of very few nations that hiked interest rates to fight in inflation in a time when global productivity was artificially being stymied . Just like the OPECmandated shortages that caused fuel prices to surge in late 70s and 80s we experienced the same ordeal with the dollar . Raising interest rates and unwinding our balance sheet allowed a dollar shortage . You may argue But did our money supply not_increase . The answer is yes . It did . But currencies are held on a relativistic scale with the rest of the world . Dollars did become scarce in times of uncertainty . Hence the DXY moving rapidly higher to levels not_seen in decades . It was only a matter of time that we would see the reversal of this extreme as economies around the world normalized . The advent of Trumps tariffs like him or not_did add some fuel to the fire . Selling off the dollar is what alleviates the burden of paying tariffs to sell goods here . China being a large proponent to this . Overall youll come to find the dollars relevance in trade is still exceedingly higher than the runnerup . Gold and silver prices screaming to new heights The price increases of GoldSilver have been often misread as this must mean the value of the dollar is falling when it should mean that the prophecy set by the first bullet point is selffulfilling . If people believe the sky is falling theyll buy bunkers . Its not_that people building bunkers is causal to the sky falling . Ive already made a post on my thoughts regarding silver so Ill not_stay too long on this one but I want to point out that in the coming months you may see the price stagnate then climb higher . You may also see it come crashing back down . Both events are equally likely . Fundamentally however I do know the shortages in gold and silver are not_led by central banking or any monetary authority . We can check money flows . When we do this we find that A theres already been an industrial shortage for silver and B This shortage has been exacerbated largely from investors and speculators without any industrial need of their own . If you use fund inflows to exchangetraded products backed by gold and silver you see theyve gone up by 2030 fold . Thats not_nothing . Thats behavioral and not_fundamental . But lets go with the assumption that the dollar must be crashing for a moment and back test this with 2 things 1 current and expected CPI 2 Long term treasury yields The CPI expectation hovers at 2.73.2 % . This is well within an expected long term CAGR from the last 5060 years . As for Long term treasury yield we use this figure because I dont want to open myself up to someone saying Well the fed has been buying treasuries so that decreases yields . They would be right but 10 and 30yr terms are the exception . Fed only interjects in overnight and short term rates . If the dollar was expected to crash domestically and internationally we would see massive selloffs of treasuries within these 10 and 30yr terms pushing yields up to a level that absorbs inflation expectations . Wed also see a really difficult auction . We havent seen either . Right now yields are 160 Bps below the 60year average and Investor appetite for treasuries is still strong evidenced by the bidtocover ratio which is actually within a normal range at 2.55 . Our DebtGDP Ratio is out of control THIS is the only real predictor we ought to pay attention to and pay attention to very closely . Our public debt vs GDP is going to tell us about our forecasted ability to cover future interest payments and the likelihood for reducing deficit spending . As interest payments as a % of total tax revenues increases it leaves less on the table for any of our other federal programs to expand . I think it should also be a predictor for where future tax policy might change . However some would argue that we can potentially grow our way out an unfavorable DebtGDP ratio . This is less likely as GDP growth in real terms historically underpaces the rate in which we accumulate public debt . Which leaves another option on the table that gives merit to the Dollar Crash concern QE Quantitative Easing . QE is a tool from which the fed purchases public debt of any maturity and does so with created credits . This typically leads to monetary expansion through our banks . So where are we really Its complicated . And the news doesnt help . The dollar is and has been declining since inception with inflationary at a consistently higher cadence since the 70s . Ill not_lie to you and say everything is okay but I also want to be clear in saying that the dollar is not_going away . We have a real problem with debt . Its growth is a constraint and though we have the same number of options for handling debt each path loses its effectiveness as deficits continue to be a scourge on our nations treasury . But heres the detail we cant miss Our economy is capitalistic not_communistic . In a capitalist country the flow of capital has a strong tendency towards the prevailing smaller number of owners relative to the entire populace . And because fewer persons have the claims on newly created money that skews inflation recognition . Not_for capital assets but for consumables . Weve seen this happen in the last decade during 2 really important eras . 1 the easymoney policy when debt was near 0 % . 2 During covid as stimulus spending made its way to the topend of the economy . Hence the Kshaped recovery . This created asset inflation and we can call it asset inflation because of how PE ratios adjusted for earnings growth have drifted a few orders of magnitude higher than historic averages . Some of this is structural . Companies today are quicker to have growth realized and go parabolic much sooner than in history . That can pullforward tomorrows pricing to today . But thats an incomplete story . If we look at capital assets theyve outpaced consumer inflation and have a tight correlation with money supply . Thats where the dollars value plunging shows up . This leads me back to my overall argument . The dollar crisis shows up depending on where youre looking . Capping it all off Ill leave you with this scenario Say I controlled the treasury and could print money at my own whim . And lets say I print off $ 10 Trillion dollars and keep all of it to myself I would . By every measure M2 money supply has increased by nearly 50 % but does this mean the dollars purchasing power has been cut by 13 No_Its the act of spending the money that creates inflation and thereby induces dollars loss of purchasing power . If I started to then spend that $ 10 Trillion buy all the food from the shelves feed America and continued that commitment without respect to the price Im paying then youd see inflation . The rule In a true currency crisis you want to find the most stable currency with the highest liquidity and lowest transactionrelated friction . For many countries companies and individuals that currency is still the US Dollar . When you have dollars convert your savings into productive assets . Let the function of those productive assets determine the best currency for them to conduct business in and you will have reaped the benefits of their price discovery . No_other class of asset will deliver this favor to you at the scale a business does ."

Many times the market has pummeled me over the head like an officer with a leaded truncheon from my grandad's days in the auxiliary force. But it's come with some steady gains since then. According to Wealth Simple my time-weighted returns are annualized after a year to the tune of 23.55% all-time, with a sloppy 81.44% simple return rate all-time. I've dabbled with ASML, TSMC, POW, MUFG over the years to make a bit of coin with some meme stonks; somehow that paid off. But the bulk of it in the beginning was honestly VGRO, and then folding when I took major losses with Trump's Tariffs where I panicked sold. But I diversified into gold because the world looks uncertain and apparently that paid off. I took a few other gambles, Rocket Lab, AMD, and Nvidia being my others which paid off. It helps to be neck deep in IT since I was little, I only wish my parents let me buy AMD and Nvidia in highschool. College me is also kicking my ass for not buying in when I had some disposable income. Overall I'm happy, but I honestly have no clue what I am doing as you can see from my mile long ticker madness. I may also be entirely misunderstanding all of these percentages and be completely regarded... But hey, green number look good. 🚀🌕 Currently researching what defense ETF's are the best picks, and specific defence related stocks as mine are a mess.

But the bulk of it in the beginning was honestly VGRO and then folding when I took major losses with Trumps Tariffs where I panicked sold . But I diversified into gold because the world looks uncertain and apparently that paid off . I took a few other gambles Rocket Lab AMD and Nvidia being my others which paid off . It helps to be neck deep in IT since I was little I only wish my parents let me buy AMD and Nvidia in highschool . College me is also kicking my ass for not_buying in when I had some disposable income . Overall Im happy but I honestly have no_clue what I am doing as you can see from my mile long ticker madness . I may also be entirely misunderstanding all of these percentages and be completely regarded ... But hey green number look good . 🚀🌕 Currently researching what defense ETFs are the best picks and specific defence related stocks as mine are a mess . Also focusing on space technology and gold ."

      "title": "The Math Behind \"Time Diversification\": Why 5 Years (60 Months) is the Statistical \"Magic Number\" for Equities",
      "selftext": "We often hear the standard advice: \"Own more bonds to stay safe.\" Or the classic \"100 minus your age\" rule. But as a data-focused analyst, I’ve always found the standard economic models (like Mean-Variance Optimization) frustrating because they fail to mathematically support long-term stock holding. Standard models penalize stocks for \"upside volatility,\" even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation. I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the *Journal of Finance* titled **\"Bond versus Stock: Investors' Age and Risk Taking\"** (Bali, Demirtas, Levy, Wolf). It uses a framework called **Almost Stochastic Dominance (ASD)** to prove that for rational investors, the \"risk\" of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon. Here is the breakdown of the data (covering U.S. markets 1941–2000): **1. The Short Run (1 Month) is a Coin Flip** If your horizon is 30 days, stocks are not \"investing\" but they are gambling. * **Dominance:** None. Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks beating bonds is only **\\~67%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" (the statistical likelihood of regret) is high at \\~28%. **2. The \"Efficiency\" Shift (48 Months)** The paper found that once you hold for 4 years, the efficient frontier shifts aggressively. * At a 48-month horizon, only portfolios with **80% or more equities** are considered efficient. * If you hold >20% bonds for a 4-year period, you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no rational utility gain. **3. The Magic Number (60 Months)** This is where the \"Time Diversification\" argument becomes irrefutable. * **Win Rate:** The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits **\\~98–99%**. * **The Risk:** The \"violation area\" shrinks to a negligible **0.24%**. **The Takeaway:** We often confuse \"Volatility\" with \"Risk.\" * In the short term (1 month), volatility IS risk. * In the long term (60 months), volatility is just the mechanism of compounding. If you have a 5-year horizon, \"playing it safe\" with heavy bond exposure isn't actually safe but it is mathematically irrational. So my question is, based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100% in stocks? :) **EDIT** **Hello Guys, based on some questions and discussions, I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section** **Q: \"Valuations (CAPE ratio) are too high. Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich.\"** **A:** While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower *magnitude* of returns (e.g., 4% vs 10%), they do not necessarily flip the *probability* of outperformance vs. bonds below 50% unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre-1990 accounting norms. Post-1990, structural changs (buybacks replacing dividends, capital-light tech) have shifted the normal CAPE range higher. Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha. **Q: \"The 'Stocks Always Win' thesis is Survivorship Bias. What about Japan or Russia?\"** **A:** Valid. The US market is the \"Empire that Won\". However, the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism, not just Ameican exceptionalism. The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification (buying \"The Rest of the World\"), not retreating to Cash or Bonds, which face their own risks (inflation/currency collapse). **Q: \"100% Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash.\"** **A:** Agreed. This is the difference between \"Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality. If holding 20% in bnds prevents an investor from panic-selling the other 80% during a drawdown, that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium, not an inefficiency. The best portfolio is the one you can stick with.",

      "selftext_processed": "We often hear the standard advice Own more bonds to stay safe . Or the classic 100 minus your age rule . But as a datafocused analyst I ’ ve always found the standard economic models like MeanVariance Optimization frustrating because they fail to mathematically support longterm stock holding . Standard models penalize stocks for upside volatility even if that volatility results in massive wealth generation . I recently did a deep dive into a landmark paper from the Journal of Finance titled Bond versus Stock Investors Age and Risk Taking Bali Demirtas Levy Wolf . It uses a framework called Almost Stochastic Dominance ASD to prove that for rational investors the risk of equities mathematically collapses at a specific time horizon . Here is the breakdown of the data covering U.S. markets 1941–2000 1 . The Short Run 1 Month is a Coin Flip If your horizon is 30 days stocks are not_investing but they are gambling . Dominance None . Stocks and Bonds are mathematically equal choices . Win Rate The probability of stocks beating bonds is only 67 % . The Risk The violation area the statistical likelihood of regret is high at 28 % . 2 . The Efficiency Shift 48 Months The paper found that once you hold for 4 years the efficient frontier shifts aggressively . At a 48month horizon only portfolios with 80 % or more equities are considered efficient . If you hold 20 % bonds for a 4year period you are accepting mathematically inferior returns for no_rational utility gain . 3 . The Magic Number 60 Months This is where the Time Diversification argument becomes irrefutable . Win Rate The probability of stocks outperforming bonds hits 98–99 % . The Risk The violation area shrinks to a negligible 0.24 % . The Takeaway We often confuse Volatility with Risk . In the short term 1 month volatility IS risk . In the long term 60 months volatility is just the mechanism of compounding . If you have a 5year horizon playing it safe with heavy bond exposure isnt actually safe but it is mathematically irrational . So my question is based on above would you be willing to change your mix or you are already 100 % in stocks EDIT Hello Guys based on some questions and discussions I decided to add a frequently asked Qs Section Q Valuations CAPE ratio are too high . Probability of stock outperformance drops when starting valuations are rich . A While high CAPE ratios historically predict lower magnitude of returns e.g . 4 % vs 10 % they do not_necessarily flip the probability of outperformance vs. bonds below 50 % unless one assumes a mean reversion to pre1990 accounting norms . Post1990 structural changs buybacks replacing dividends capitallight tech have shifted the normal CAPE range higher . Waiting for a reversion to historical means often results in missing decades of alpha . Q The Stocks Always Win thesis is Survivorship Bias . What about Japan or Russia A Valid . The US market is the Empire that Won . However the Equity Risk Premium is a structural feature of capitalism not_just Ameican exceptionalism . The solution to US Reversion Risk is Global Diversification buying The Rest of the World not_retreating to Cash or Bonds which face their own risks inflationcurrency collapse . Q 100 % Equities is psychologically impossible for most people during a crash . A Agreed . This is the difference between Mathematical Optimality vs Behavioral Optimality . If holding 20 % in bnds prevents an investor from panicselling the other 80 % during a drawdown that bond drag is a necessary insurance premium not_an inefficiency . The best portfolio is the one you can stick with ."

      "selftext": "source: [ Prior was +3.0% * PPI M/M +0.5% vs 0.2% expected * Prior +0.2% * Core PPI Y/Y +3.3% vs +2.9% expected * Prior +3.0% (revised to 3.1%) * Core PPI M/M +0.7% vs +0.2% expected * Prior +0.0% These are much higher than expected figures and we're seeing a hawkish reaction in the markets with upside in the dollar and Treasury yields, and downside in stocks and precious metals. The agency notes that the December increase in prices for final demand can be traced to a 0.7-percent advance in the index for final demand services. Prices for final demand goods were unchanged. Fed Chair Powell mentioned that they expect the Core PCE Y/Y to be around 3.0% in December. This PPI report is unlikely to trigger big market moves as we await next week's data, with the US NFP report being the main highlight. The market is pricing 52 bps of easing by year and that's unlikely to change much with this report. The Fed upgraded the current economic outlook in their last policy statement to reflect the improvement in the data. In December, the Fed projected just one cut in 2026, so we will need more labour market deterioration or bigger than expected fall in inflation to see them going faster on rate cuts.",

      "selftext": "I received many DMs after my [first post]( about $SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected, so here it is. **BACKGROUND:** Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee. In-app prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat+. So I compiled data from 80 respondents (37k+ friends in total) to estimate Snap’s earning potential. **THE GOOD NEWS:** I remain confident that subscription-based revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter, which should result in \\~12.5% growth in run-rate revenue and \\~25% bump in enterprise value expectation (though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot) **THE BAD NEWS:** The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat+ subs will not be realized as Q4 revenue, but will instead build rapidly over the next year. This is because of **(1)** steep first-month signup discounts, **(2)** in-app prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter, and **(3)** the fact that “Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription” (from 10-Q). (That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won’t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4). Also, Apple’s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year. **METHOD:** (See Images 3 and 4) I broke down user count by age group and location (US, EU, INDIA/ROW) using DAU reports from the 10Q. I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics. I multiplied the two matrices together, summed to get a demographic-weighted average of DAUs who are subscribed, then multiplied by total DAUs. I also multiplied by a “Zombie factor” to account for inactive users on respondents’ friend lists. This leads me to the 100% increase figure with assumptions: * Of the average user’s friend list, 40% are DAU, 40% are MAU, and 20% are inactive. * People over age 35 (making up 30% of the user base) are completely ignored. * $2/mo subscription plans are completely ignored. **Assumption analysis** INDIA: India accounts for \\~40% of users, so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight. I spent 5 hours on Azar (like Omegle but more popular in India), but I couldn’t get a single Indian user to give me their data (though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat+). So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 1/10 of those in the US for the same age group. I think this is reasonable because Snapchat+ is 50 Rupees per month in India, corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity. DOUBLE-COUNTING: I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed (as opposed to the friend-count-weighted method I used in my first post). **NOTE:** Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low (0.29), so this may not be necessary. INACTIVE USERS: Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis. Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs , I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap+ per DAU metric. Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs. As a 21-year old, I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this: A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity. Also, criminals love Snapchat for self-deleting texts. Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends. **OTHER NOTES:** I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap+ friends. I attribute this to an error in sampling; these users assumed that, because they were sent to a different page than was shown, their Snap+ friend count must be 0. This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection. Snap doesn’t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q, instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards. I won’t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid. Schwab was showing me +$19k in (totally fake) unrealized P&L on Tuesday based on mid-to-market rates (the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x). If anyone knows how to change this, please comment below. **Safe to say I’m down a lot. But I haven’t sold anything.** Holding till Feb 4th. Cross your fingies for me. PS: See the raw data [Here]( I'd love to see your analysis! PPS: If you know any 35-yr-olds or Indians who use Snapchat, please ask them for their data and comment it below.",

      "selftext_processed": "I received many DMs after my first post about $ SNAP asking for an update on the Snapchat subscription data I collected so here it is . BACKGROUND Snapchat recently announced that users with more than 5GB of photos saved would have to start paying a monthly subscription fee . Inapp prompting shows users how many friends they have who subscribe to Snapchat . So I compiled data from 80 respondents 37k friends in total to estimate Snap ’ s earning potential . THE GOOD NEWS I remain confident that subscriptionbased revenue grew by more than 2x over the past quarter which should result in 12.5 % growth in runrate revenue and 25 % bump in enterprise value expectation though stock price will obviously also be affected by expectations of future signups closer to the deletion date and whatnot THE BAD NEWS The vast majority of additional value due to new Snapchat subs will not_be realized as Q4 revenue but will instead build rapidly over the next year . This is because of 1 steep firstmonth signup discounts 2 inapp prompting beginning in waves throughout the quarter and 3 the fact that “ Subscription revenue is initially deferred and then recognized ratably over the term of the subscription ” from 10Q . That last bit means that revenue from annual subscribers won ’ t be recognized in Q4 despite Snap receiving the money in Q4 . Also Apple ’ s royalty on subscription revenue drops by half after the end of the first year . METHOD See Images 3 and 4 I broke down user count by age group and location US EU INDIAROW using DAU reports from the 10Q . I matched this with the unweighted average subscription rate for those demographics . I multiplied the two matrices together summed to get a demographicweighted average of DAUs who are subscribed then multiplied by total DAUs . I also multiplied by a “ Zombie factor ” to account for inactive users on respondents ’ friend lists . This leads me to the 100 % increase figure with assumptions Of the average user ’ s friend list 40 % are DAU 40 % are MAU and 20 % are inactive . People over age 35 making up 30 % of the user base are completely ignored . $ 2mo subscription plans are completely ignored . Assumption analysis INDIA India accounts for 40 % of users so their adoption rate carries a lot of weight . I spent 5 hours on Azar like Omegle but more popular in India but I couldn ’ t get a single Indian user to give me their data though the number one reason for this was that the person already had Snapchat . So I assumed the Indian Subscription rates as 110 of those in the US for the same age group . I think this is reasonable because Snapchat is 50 Rupees per month in India corresponding to 50 cents by exchange rate but $ 2.50 by Purchasing Power Parity . DOUBLECOUNTING I used raw averages of % of friends subscribed as opposed to the friendcountweighted method I used in my first post . NOTE Correlation coefficient between friend count and % of friends who are subscribed is pretty low 0.29 so this may not_be necessary . INACTIVE USERS Inactive users are a major source of error for my analysis . Given that MAUs are 2x higher than DAUs I think it is reasonable to multiply the measured % by at least 2x to turn it into Snap per DAU metric . Some of you are going to say this is unreasonable because inactive users may have fewer friends than DAUs . As a 21year old I can anecdotally vouch for a few forces that fight this A good portion of power users with over 1M snap score make new accounts because having over 1M snap score is sometimes seen as an indicator of promiscuity . Also criminals love Snapchat for selfdeleting texts . Both of these user groups are likely to have inactive secondary accounts with tons of friends . OTHER NOTES I removed all respondents who reported 0 Snap friends . I attribute this to an error in sampling these users assumed that because they were sent to a different page than was shown their Snap friend count must be 0 . This was directly reported by a few people who revised their comments on my previous post as well as seen during my manual collection . Snap doesn ’ t report raw Subscriber numbers in the 10Q instead reporting them in the earnings call afterwards . I won ’ t post my current position value because my options are so illiquid . Schwab was showing me $ 19k in totally fake unrealized PL on Tuesday based on midtomarket rates the market maker increased the lowest ask on some of my options by a factor of 70x . If anyone knows how to change this please comment below . Safe to say I ’ m down a lot . But I haven ’ t sold anything . Holding till Feb 4th . Cross your fingies for me . PS See the raw data Here Id love to see your analysis PPS If you know any 35yrolds or Indians who use Snapchat please ask them for their data and comment it below ."

      "selftext": "Hi, I have a HELOC from a few years ago when we thought renos were imminent. It's looking like it'll happen this year now. I'm afraid of the long end of the curve shooting up in the next several months. I could currently borrow $100k / 20yrs / 6.32%. If I wanted to lock that in and could invest it in something that yields more but is steady(ish) then I'd be set while I wait. So my question is do you think this is wise? What do you feel is the safest 6.5-7.5% yield I could get? I've looked at JEPI, VZ. I'm sure there's a bunch of options but what do you think and is it even worth it? Again, I'm afraid of the long end spiking and the rate shooting up later this year. Thanks!",

Even in this early form trusted testers were able to create an impressive range of fascinating worlds and experiences and uncovered entirely new ways to use it . The next step is to broaden access through a dedicated interactive prototype focused on immersive world creation . Starting today were rolling out access to Project Genie for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S 18 . This experimental research prototype lets users create explore and remix their own interactive worlds . Source Unity is down over 20 % Take Two and Roblox down 10 % . I cant imagine how far this tech will go 1yr 5yr 10yr down the line . The dystopian world where everybody is logged into a virtual world seems inevitable at this point ."

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced on Friday that Kevin Warsh will succeed Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve, bringing an end to months of speculation and uncertainty around the central bank’s leadership. Trump shared the news on Truth Social, saying he’s known Warsh for a long time and believes he’ll be remembered as one of the great Fed chairs. Warsh previously served as a Fed governor during the financial crisis era and has been viewed as a more market-friendly, policy-focused pick. The appointment follows a turbulent period for the Fed, marked by political pressure, public criticism from the White House, and questions about the bank’s independence. Powell’s tenure saw aggressive rate hikes to fight inflation, followed by cuts as growth slowed. Markets are now trying to figure out what this means for monetary policy going forward especially on interest rates, inflation control, and how independent the Fed will remain under new leadership. Curious to hear thoughts: does Warsh bring stability, or does this raise new concerns about political influence over the Fed? Source:",

I'm just looking for advice on what stocks I should keep my eye on daily, some friends have talked about NVDA AMD AVGO ORCL and obviously Tesla.

So my favorite thing to do is buy a hundred shares of a stock in hopes that it goes up a dollar maybe two . I use some tight stop losses but for the most part I try buying Blue chips and if I have to hold I have to hold . Im just looking for advice on what stocks I should keep my eye on daily some friends have talked about NVDA AMD AVGO ORCL and obviously Tesla .

      "selftext": "OpenAI is laying the groundwork for a public listing in the fourth quarter of this year, people familiar with the matter said, accelerating its plans as competition with rival Anthropic intensifies. The $500 billion startup is holding informal talks with Wall Street banks about a potential initial public offering, people familiar with the matter said, and is growing its finance team. That includes the hire of a new chief accounting officer, Ajmere Dale, and a new corporate business finance officer, Cynthia Gaylor, who will oversee investor relations. OpenAI, currently valued around $500 billion, has accelerated its fundraising, reportedly hoping to raise up to $100 billion, while Anthropic, which makes the Claude chatbot, is said to be looking to raise about $20 billion. Separately Thursday, the Journal reported that Amazon is in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI. And Japan’s SoftBank is reportedly considering investing up to $30 billion in OpenAI. Both OpenAI and Anthropic have been bleeding money, losing billions of dollars annually as they race for the upper hand in the fast-growing artificial-intelligence field. Anthropic hopes to break even in 2028, while OpenAI doesn’t foresee turning a profit until 2030. All of that could make 2026 a huge year for IPOs; Elon Musk’s SpaceX is reportedly aiming to go public as soon as June, and Anthropic is also reportedly hoping for a public offering before year’s end.

It's very interesting to see the top comment saying that TSLA at $60bn is simply too big to be a tenbagger. Also interesting to see some of the hype names from this time period and how they correlate to today's hype names. For example SPCE. Yes, there were space hype stocks even back then. The less said about that performance, the better! To us some of the stocks mentioned may seem silly. But who's to say 6 years from now, those suggesting \"RKLB, ASTS\" might look foolish. Either way, important remind me to stay rational.",

Its very interesting to see the top comment saying that TSLA at $ 60bn is simply too big to be a tenbagger . Also interesting to see some of the hype names from this time period and how they correlate to todays hype names . For example SPCE . Yes there were space hype stocks even back then . The less said about that performance the better To us some of the stocks mentioned may seem silly . But whos to say 6 years from now those suggesting RKLB ASTS might look foolish . Either way important remind me to stay rational ."

      "selftext": "Samsung Electronics reported an over threefold surge in fourth-quarter profits on Thursday, hitting a new record and beating analysts' estimates, as a memory chip shortage and strong demand for artificial intelligence servers lifted earnings. Here are Samsung's fourth-quarter results compared with LSEG SmartEstimate, which is weighted toward forecasts from analysts who are more consistently accurate: - Revenue: 93.8 trillion Korean won ($65.58 billion) vs. 93.318 trillion won expected - Operating profit: 20.1 trillion won vs. 20.018 trillion won expected The South Korean technology giant's quarterly revenue rose about 24% from a year earlier to hit a new record. Meanwhile, its operating profit climbed over 200% year over year. The profits surpassed Samsung's long-standing record of 17.6 trillion won set in the third quarter of 2018, while matching Samsung's own guidance of around 20 trillion won. Operating profit at the company's mobile experience division fell to 1.9 trillion won, down 9.5% from a year earlier and over 45% from the previous quarter. The company said the losses were due to \"reduced launch effects\" from new smartphone models and intense market competition.",

Management expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $4.655 billion which implies approximately 30% annual revenue growth. Management expects adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.6 billion, which equates to an annual EBITDA margin of approximately 34%. Management expects adjusted net income of approximately $825 million, which equates to a margin of approximately 18%. Lastly, management expects adjusted EPS of approximately 60 cents per share. In the first quarter of 2026, management expects to deliver adjusted net revenue of approximately $1.04 billion, adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million, adjusted net income of approximately $160 million, and adjusted EPS of approximately 12 cents per share. Over the medium term, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted net revenue of at least 30% from 2025 to 2028. Additionally, management expects to deliver compounded annual growth in adjusted earnings per share of 38% to 42% from 2025 to 2028. This guidance assumes there are no meaningful changes in the macroeconomic environment and no significant new business launches or acquisitions. Management will further address guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call. Management has not reconciled forward-looking non-GAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures. This is because the company cannot predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to market-related assumptions that are not within our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs, tax costs or other costs that may arise. For these reasons, management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures.\" [",

Management will further address guidance on the quarterly earnings conference call . Management has not_reconciled forwardlooking nonGAAP measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures . This is because the company can not predict with reasonable certainty and without unreasonable efforts the ultimate outcome of certain GAAP components of such reconciliations due to marketrelated assumptions that are not_within our control as well as certain legal or advisory costs tax costs or other costs that may arise . For these reasons management is unable to assess the probable significance of the unavailable information which could materially impact the amount of the future directly comparable GAAP measures ."

      "selftext": "Note: * Post title says 'surge' which is not accurate. It should be 'rebounded' * Gold -8% and silver -17% was at the lowest point in pre-market. Check the charts at the bottom of this post. Source: [ >Gold and silver suffered the biggest sell-off in years, in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that’s lifted prices to all-time highs. >Gold dropped as much as 8% to crash through $5,000 an ounce, while silver slumped below $100 as the sell-off swept through the broader metals markets. Copper dropped more than 3% in London, after surging above $14,000 a ton for the first time on Thursday, in its biggest intraday jump since 2008. >The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair. The greenback’s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken. Chinese investors have led the charge, buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets. >Silver plunged more than 17% toward $95 an ounce, intensifying a period of extreme volatility that’s rocked the precious metals industry. A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6%, making precious metals more expensive for most buyers. Platinum tumbled more than 10%. >President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair, Bloomberg News reported. The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk, but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates. Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time. >Gold’s move “validates the cautionary tale of fast-up, fast-down,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. While reports of Warsh’s nomination were a trigger, a correction was overdue, he said. “It’s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves.” >With gold and silver jumping so much already this year, some technical indicators flashed warning signs. One is the relative-strength index, which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction. Gold’s RSI recently hit 90, the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades. >Even after the pullback, gold is still up around 17% in January, closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980. The jump in silver has been eye-watering, with the white metal up nearly 40% so far this year. >The Trump administration’s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela’s leader, along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver. Most recently, Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba. >Meanwhile, the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal. The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry *Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1...* *Processing img obfjz24gfhgg1...* *Processing img myzc6u4u5kgg1...*",

      "selftext_processed": "Note Post title says surge which is not_accurate . It should be rebounded Gold 8 % and silver 17 % was at the lowest point in premarket . Check the charts at the bottom of this post . Source Gold and silver suffered the biggest selloff in years in a whipsawing reversal of a scorching rally that ’ s lifted prices to alltime highs . Gold dropped as much as 8 % to crash through $ 5000 an ounce while silver slumped below $ 100 as the selloff swept through the broader metals markets . Copper dropped more than 3 % in London after surging above $ 14000 a ton for the first time on Thursday in its biggest intraday jump since 2008 . The selloff came as the dollar rebounded after a report the Trump administration is preparing to nominate Kevin Warsh for Federal Reserve chair . The greenback ’ s rally undercut sentiment among investors who had been piling into metals after the president signaled a willingness to let the currency weaken . Chinese investors have led the charge buying in such force that it prompted the Shanghai Futures Exchange to rush out measures to cool the surge in precious and industrial metal markets . Silver plunged more than 17 % toward $ 95 an ounce intensifying a period of extreme volatility that ’ s rocked the precious metals industry . A gauge of the dollar rose as much as 0.6 % making precious metals more expensive for most buyers . Platinum tumbled more than 10 % . President Donald Trump is expected to announce Warsh as his nomination for Fed chair Bloomberg News reported . The former Fed governor has a longstanding reputation as an inflation hawk but has aligned himself with the president in recent months by arguing publicly for lower interest rates . Trump said he would announce his nominee on Friday morning US time . Gold ’ s move “ validates the cautionary tale of fastup fastdown ” said Christopher Wong a strategist at OverseaChinese Banking Corp . While reports of Warsh ’ s nomination were a trigger a correction was overdue he said . “ It ’ s like one of those excuses markets are waiting for to unwind those parabolic moves. ” With gold and silver jumping so much already this year some technical indicators flashed warning signs . One is the relativestrength index which in recent weeks signaled that both metals may have become overbought and due a correction . Gold ’ s RSI recently hit 90 the highest it has been for the precious metal in decades . Even after the pullback gold is still up around 17 % in January closing in on its sharpest monthly gain since 1980 . The jump in silver has been eyewatering with the white metal up nearly 40 % so far this year . The Trump administration ’ s upending of the global order — including the seizure of Venezuela ’ s leader along with threats to annex Greenland and impose tariff against allies — has been a major driver . Most recently Trump has been warning of a possible strike on Iran and saying he will put levies on any countries that provide oil to Cuba . Meanwhile the risk of another US government shutdown was avoided after Trump and Senate Democrats reached a tentative deal . The White House is continuing to negotiate with Democrats on placing new limits on immigration raids that have provoked a national outcry Processing img 5m141m0afhgg1 ...

      "selftext": "President Donald Trump on Friday named Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, ending a five-month odyssey that has seen unprecedented turmoil around the central bank. The decision culminates a process that officially began last summer but started much earlier than that, with Trump launching a fusillade of criticism against the Powell-led Fed almost since Powell took the job in 2018. “I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,” said Trump in a Truth Social post announcing the selection. The pick of Warsh, 55, likely wouldn’t ripple markets because of his past Fed experience and Wall Street’s view that he wouldn’t always do Trump’s bidding. “He has the respect and credibility of the financial markets,” said David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” “There was no person who was going to get this job who wasn’t going to be cutting rates in the short term. However, I believe longer term he will be a credible candidate,” added Bahnsen. Since Powell’s confirmation in 2018, during Trump’s first term, he has persistently hectored policymakers to lower interest rates aggressively. Even with three successive reductions in the latter part of 2025, the president kept up the attack, pressing for lower rates and criticizing Powell for cost overruns at the Fed’s massive renovation of its Washington, D.C. headquarters.",

      "selftext": "Lately I’ve been noticing what feels like a real shift in how markets are being approached, and I’d love to hear some experienced perspectives. For years, the dominant strategy felt very company-centric: pick the best operators, best balance sheets, best management, especially in tech and growth sectors. Now, it seems like more capital is flowing one layer earlier into materials, minerals, and commodities themselves. Copper, aluminum, uranium, rare earths, energy inputs, etc. Instead of betting on which company will win, people are buying the stuff that everyone needs to build things: AI infrastructure, data centers, EVs, grids, defense, nuclear, renewables. It feels like a “picks and shovels” shift, but even more basic not the companies selling the shovels, but the metal the shovel is made of. Some thoughts/questions I’m wrestling with: • Is this a response to supply constraints + underinvestment over the last decade? • Is it a hedge against policy risk, geopolitics, and deglobalization? • Is it simply that materials are easier to price in an inflationary / capex-heavy world than high-multiple companies? • Or is this just another cycle that looks obvious in hindsight? For those of you who’ve been through multiple cycles: • Do commodities tend to outperform during big technological + infrastructure transitions? • Is long-term exposure (via ETFs or producers) actually a smart 5–10 year play, or do most people overstay these trades? • How do you personally think about risk management with commodities vs equities? Not looking for stock tips, more interested in how professionals frame this shift mentally and strategically. Curious to hear your takes.",

For years the dominant strategy felt very companycentric pick the best operators best balance sheets best management especially in tech and growth sectors . Now it seems like more capital is flowing one layer earlier into materials minerals and commodities themselves . Copper aluminum uranium rare earths energy inputs etc . Instead of betting on which company will win people are buying the stuff that everyone needs to build things AI infrastructure data centers EVs grids defense nuclear renewables . It feels like a “ picks and shovels ” shift but even more basic not_the companies selling the shovels but the metal the shovel is made of . Some thoughtsquestions I ’ m wrestling with • Is this a response to supply constraints underinvestment over the last decade • Is it a hedge against policy risk geopolitics and deglobalization • Is it simply that materials are easier to price in an inflationary capexheavy world than highmultiple companies • Or is this just another cycle that looks obvious in hindsight For those of you who ’ ve been through multiple cycles • Do commodities tend to outperform during big technological infrastructure transitions • Is longterm exposure via ETFs or producers actually a smart 5–10 year play or do most people overstay these trades • How do you personally think about risk management with commodities vs equities Not_looking for stock tips more interested in how professionals frame this shift mentally and strategically . Curious to hear your takes ."

      "selftext": "Hello, i would like to start an educated discussion on Palantir stock, i’m not predicting anything (i specify it cause the bot keeps deleting the post, is it illegal to discuss stocks on a channel dedicated to stock investing?). This is my take on it: The company ~~has basically ONE~~ depends heavily on one customer, the US government, the same government that has an unmanageable 37 trillion debt that is struggling to get refinanced because everyone seems to be unloading US treasuries. The company has a gigantic CAPEX and a price/earning ratio of ~~more than 200~~ 369 so im pretty bearish on it if i look at the valuation even if i recognise the decent margins and incredible growth that seems undefensible. Can someone still bullish on Palantir explain to me why is it? please add details, i’m open to different ideas than my own. thanks! EDIT: I'm asking for an opinion, i explicitly wrote \"i’m open to different ideas than my own\", i'm not selling my take as gold and some of you had the courtesy to explain my data may not be up-to-date so please keep that in mind and remain respectful, its supposed to be an exchange of ideas not an ideological war.",

      "selftext": "This is the daily discussion, so anything stocks related is fine, but the theme for today is on fundamentals, but if fundamentals aren't your thing then just ignore the theme. Some helpful day to day links, including news: * [Finviz]( for charts, fundamentals, and aggregated news on individual stocks * [Bloomberg market news]( * StreetInsider news: * [Market Check]( - Possibly why the market is doing what it's doing including sudden spikes/dips * [Reuters aggregated]( - Global news ----- Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports. Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue. You'll also find value stocks pay dividends, but never invest in a company solely for its dividend. See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki: [Market Cap - Shares Outstanding - Volume - Dividend - EPS - P/E Ratio - EPS Q/Q - PEG - Sales Q/Q - Return on Assets (ROA) - Return on Equity (ROE) - BETA - SMA - quarterly earnings]( If you have a basic question, for example \"what is EBITDA,\" then google \"investopedia EBITDA\" and click the Investopedia article on it; do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned. Useful links: * [Investopedia page]( on fundamental analysis including [Discounted Cash Flow]( analysis; see [definition here]( and read [their PDF on the topic.]( * [FINVIZ]( for fundamental data, charts, and aggregated news * [Earnings Whisper]( for earnings details See our past [daily discussions here.]( Also links for: [Technicals]( Tuesday, [Options Trading]( Thursday, and [Fundamentals]( Friday.",

      "selftext_processed": "This is the daily discussion so anything stocks related is fine but the theme for today is on fundamentals but if fundamentals arent your thing then just ignore the theme . Some helpful day to day links including news Finviz for charts fundamentals and aggregated news on individual stocks Bloomberg market news StreetInsider news Market Check Possibly why the market is doing what its doing including sudden spikesdips Reuters aggregated Global news Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports . Expect a lot of volatility around earnings but it usually doesnt matter if youre holding long term but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well . But growth stocks dont rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future . Value stocks do rely on earnings reports investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS revenue . Youll also find value stocks pay dividends but never_invest in a company solely for its dividend . See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki Market Cap Shares Outstanding Volume Dividend EPS PE Ratio EPS QQ PEG Sales QQ Return on Assets ROA Return on Equity ROE BETA SMA quarterly earnings If you have a basic question for example what is EBITDA then google investopedia EBITDA and click the Investopedia article on it do this for everything until you have a more in depth question or just want to share what you learned . Useful links Investopedia page on fundamental analysis including Discounted Cash Flow analysis see definition here and read their PDF on the topic . FINVIZ for fundamental data charts and aggregated news Earnings Whisper for earnings details See our past daily discussions here .

      "selftext": "I've been in the market long enough to realize one thing: more research does NOT automatically mean better decisions. Early on, I did what everyone praises: • Read every SEC filing • Dig through earnings calls line by line • Compare competitors, TAM, margins, moats... you name it At some point, research stopped being a tool and turned into a hiding place. Hiding from making a decision. Hiding from being wrong. Here's what experience taught me the hard way: 1. If your thesis can't fit on half a page, you don't have a thesis. It's just information hoarding. 2. Most data is noise once you've identified the 2-3 variables that actually move the business. Revenue driver, cost structure, capital allocation. The rest is intellectual entertainment. 3. Buffett-style investing isn't about reading everything. It's about knowing what to ignore. My process now is brutally simple: • Start with a single falsifiable thesis • Define what would make me wrong before I read more • Time-box research aggressively • Stop the moment new info stops changing the decision If after that I'm still unsure, I pass. Missing a trade is cheap. Being stuck in analysis paralysis is expensive. Curious how others handle this: • Do you use strict checklists? • Hard time limits? • Or do you accept that research never really \"ends\"? Interested to hear from people who've been through a few cycles - not just theory.",

Early on I did what everyone praises • Read every SEC filing • Dig through earnings calls line by line • Compare competitors TAM margins moats ... you name it At some point research stopped being a tool and turned into a hiding place . Hiding from making a decision . Hiding from being wrong . Heres what experience taught me the hard way 1 . If your thesis cant fit on half a page you dont have a thesis . Its just information hoarding . 2 . Most data is noise once youve identified the 23 variables that actually move the business . Revenue driver cost structure capital allocation . The rest is intellectual entertainment . 3 . Buffettstyle investing isnt about reading everything . Its about knowing what to ignore . My process now is brutally simple • Start with a single falsifiable thesis • Define what would make me wrong before I read more • Timebox research aggressively • Stop the moment new info stops changing the decision If after that Im still unsure I pass . Missing a trade is cheap . Being stuck in analysis paralysis is expensive . Curious how others handle this • Do you use strict checklists • Hard time limits • Or do you accept that research never_really ends Interested to hear from people whove been through a few cycles not_just theory ."

      "selftext": "Q3 2025 net income = -$21.39 million Q4 2025 net income = $38.95 million Increase = 17.56m (profitable!) So why the shift? Webull has been spending heavily on infrastructure and global expansion. They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index. It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly - with more features than many desktop apps can dream of. Ai assistant was implemented. Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement. But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story. Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly, within same year they spent the money! 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year, and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement, it seems all sunshine and rainbows. But the stock itself is telling a different story - reaching new lows day after day. Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and \"chinese ownership\" as a problem. In other words, fud is churning, retail is selling (per robinhood stat) and hedge funds are.. buying? Thats right, hedge funds are aggressively adding right now. At the same time, short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25! Furthermore, the stock is massively overleveraged. The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for - thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares. The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper. But this is very unlikely to happen. So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding, seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later, and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin. And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5% hit. So what does the future hold for webull? *concentrates* An intense warzone between fundamentals, fud, and manipulators. Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon (tesla) but.. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast? Could it be that... we see inverse tesla, and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share? The answer is.. yes. Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma, hedge funds, and fud are king. Fundamentals have not played a part in a long time. An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion. Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift.",

They recently added crypto and predictions and are now exclusively the only platform enabling hourlies on the spx index . It is a beefy platform and the mobile app runs flawlessly with more features than many desktop apps can dream of . Ai assistant was implemented . Lots of partnerships and expendature led to a messy income statement . But earnings in q4 2025 tells a different story . Theyre just getting ramped up and already millions profitable quarterly within same year they spent the money 2026 Q1 earnings will set the stage for this year and with customer assets having steadily climbed with each quarter along with user engagement it seems all sunshine and rainbows . But the stock itself is telling a different story reaching new lows day after day . Discussions on various forums continue to state unprofitibility and chinese ownership as a problem . In other words fud is churning retail is selling per robinhood stat and hedge funds are .. buying Thats right hedge funds are aggressively adding right now . At the same time short interest at an all time high and every day we see a short volume ratio of 25 Furthermore the stock is massively overleveraged . The irony here is more losers than winners if the stock suddenly starts to run up violently as over 50 million shares are already called for thus locking investors in place or forcing them to buy shares . The losses to gamma would be absolutely biblical and be on the front page of every investor newspaper . But this is very unlikely to happen . So here we are with a company whos rapidly expanding seeing ROI on expendature a mere quarter later and hosts the most capable mobile retail brokerage app to ever exist by huge margin . And yet today its stock tanked for the 9th consecutive day and took a 5 % hit . So what does the future hold for webull concentrates An intense warzone between fundamentals fud and manipulators . Weve seen a company doesnt have to make money to blast off to the moon tesla but .. what if the opposite is true for a company who makes money too fast Could it be that ... we see inverse tesla and webull reaches its low analyst target of 74 cents per share The answer is .. yes . Becouse we are in a different market landscape now for where gamma hedge funds and fud are king . Fundamentals have not_played a part in a long time . An unprofitable company can be worth a quarter trillion while a profitable one is worth 3 billion . Webull just happens to be the first major victim of this paradigm shift ."

      "selftext": "[Breaking News] - Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will be naming his pick Friday for the new Federal Reserve chair. Speaking at the premiere for “Melania,” the film about first lady Melania Trump, the president said the five-month odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end. “I’ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning,” Trump said. Asked if he had actually settled on a choice, he replied, “I do, I better, otherwise I have to go to work very quickly.” The process for deciding on Powell’s replacement began in September with an 11-candidate field that included past and current Fed officials, economists and Wall Street investment professionals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates, whittling the list down to five and then four. The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder. Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job. Hassett had been the leader for some time, then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder. However, that flipped Thursday evening, with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80% favorite. An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday. However, a White House official dismissed speculation. “President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture. Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone’s time,” said White House spokesman Kush Desai. For his part, Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May. Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor’s term.",

Speaking at the premiere for “ Melania ” the film about first lady Melania Trump the president said the fivemonth odyssey of finding his pick to succeed current Chair Jerome Powell is about to end . “ I ’ ll be announcing the Fed chair tomorrow morning ” Trump said . Asked if he had actually settled on a choice he replied “ I do I better otherwise I have to go to work very quickly. ” The process for deciding on Powell ’ s replacement began in September with an 11candidate field that included past and current Fed officials economists and Wall Street investment professionals . Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent screened the qualifying candidates whittling the list down to five and then four . The final four is believed to be former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett current Fed Governor Christopher Waller and BlackRock chief investment officer for fixed income Rick Rieder . Prediction markets have been betting on who gets the job . Hassett had been the leader for some time then Warsh and for the past several days Rieder . However that flipped Thursday evening with Kalshi now putting Warsh as a prohibitive 80 % favorite . An administration source told CNBC that Warsh was at the White House on Thursday . However a White House official dismissed speculation . “ President Trump will make an announcement about his pick for the Federal Reserve at the appropriate juncture . Any and all reporting on the Federal Reserve Chairman nominations process until then is a waste of everyone ’ s time ” said White House spokesman Kush Desai . For his part Powell balked at questions over whether he will stay on after his term as chair expires in May . Powell has the option of serving out the remaining two years on his governor ’ s term ."

      "selftext": "You should look into Etsy and their general circular internal stock compensation/buyback series. Outgoing CEO Josh Silverman was paid over $200 million in sold stock compensation, at a time when the company was overpaying for acquisitions, as seen in their recent dispositions at a 90% loss. While paying executives excessive comp packages, they have announced a non-expiring $1 billion share buyback program as the company sees fit. All the while, they have $3 billion + in debt on the balance sheet that ballooned as a result of the failed acquisitions. The company is not investing in the future, they simply are propping up their share price as the marketplace continues to be flooded with mass-manufactured products and overseas sellers. Their partnerships with AI are further very ambiguous, costing sellers more, and ultimately removing ETSY's need for existence. AI may eventually replace the marketplace altogether by selling direct and allowing customers to engage directly with sellers without the need for Etsy. While some of the above is speculation of the future, the aggressive share buyback program in a time where the company is high in debt, and low in growth, is creating a false sense of value. Etsy is trading at a 38 P/E after recent decline compared to EBAY's 20 P/E and EBAY has been much more successful in terms of scale, margins, and growth since 2021. Price Target would be in the low $30s.",

      "selftext": "Elon Musk's SpaceX and xAI are in merger talks ahead of initial public offering later this year. Under the proposed merger, shares of xAI would be exchanged for shares in SpaceX (SPACEX). Two entities have been set up in Nevada to facilitate the transaction. A merger would combine Musk's rockets, Starlink satellites, the social media platform X and GrokAI chatbot under one roof, according to the report. Some xAI executives could be given the option to receive cash instead of SpaceX stock as part of the deal, according to Reuters. A final agreement hasn't been signed and the timing and structure of a transaction remain fluid. Musk, SpaceX, and xAI didn't respond to Reuters requests for comment. The Financial Times reported earlier that SpaceX is looking at a mid-June IPO, aiming to raise as much as $50B at valuation of roughly $1.5T. Tesla said on Wednesday that it will invest about $2B in xAI.",

You all know that when markets open they are always somewhat unstable and often rise or fall sharply; there are enormous variations in the first few minutes of the markets (I'm referring to the US markets, which are the only ones that interest me). For example, today the markets started the day falling immensely, most likely due to the shutdown. I didn't know about the shutdown because I'm not American, but if I had known, I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening. Is there a way to know, with some certainty, what will happen when the US markets open? Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open? Thank you very much.

For example today the markets started the day falling immensely most likely due to the shutdown . I didnt know about the shutdown because Im not_American but if I had known I could have anticipated the abrupt variation the market experienced at the opening . Is there a way to know with some certainty what will happen when the US markets open Is there somewhere we can discuss the behavior of the markets each day as they open Thank you very much . Best regards ."

      "selftext": "Hi all! My fiancé and I are closing on a house in 2 weeks and I am considering selling off some stocks to boost the down payment (about 20% of the down payment will be from my investments). I have 2 questions: 1. I have a Schwab account that I personally control investments on, and a Qapital robo-investing account that does it for me! I can either cash out some of my Qapital, which would simplify stock choices, or sell investments from my Schwab account, where I would have to choose which stocks/etfs/etc I'm selling. My Qapital accounts are honestly doing pretty well, but the idea of choosing stocks is daunting! Which would you recommend? 2. If I go ahead and sell stocks using my Schwab account, how do I best choose which stocks to sell? Please use the most basic terminology possible, I am absolutely NOT a finance bro and need to be talked to like (in the nicest way possible) an idiot :) Pls be gentle! Update: Spent all of last night looking through my portfolio, reading everyone's comments and learning a ton! I sold my first stocks today! Thank you so much to everyone who commented and left helpful advice, I super appreciate each and every one of you!",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I’m 19 and based in Canada. I invest mainly through TFSA and FHSA accounts, which are essentially Roth IRA equivalents. I’ll soon be receiving about $14,000 USD of new, non-taxable capital. This is long-term money and I’m explicitly trying to outperform the S&P 500, fully accepting higher volatility and drawdowns. I already have a growth- and tech-heavy portfolio. Roughly speaking, my current exposure looks like this: • NBIS (AI / infrastructure): \\~35% • ASTS (satellite connectivity): \\~20% • GOOG: \\~15% • RKLB (space launch): \\~10% • MU (semiconductors): \\~5% • XAR (aerospace & defense ETF): \\~5% • Small ETH exposure and other minor positions: \\~10% So I’m already very far from the index, intentionally. I am looking for stock picks, especially ideas that could reasonably outperform over a long horizon and that would complement or strengthen this portfolio rather than just add more of the same exposure. I’m interested in: • high-quality growth • infrastructure or platform businesses • situations with strong long-term Not looking to trade or gamble, and not looking for short-term hype. I’m more interested in ideas with a clear multi-year thesis. Curious to hear what names you’d be looking at if you were deploying fresh capital with this objective. Thanks.",

I ’ ll soon be receiving about $ 14000 USD of new nontaxable capital . This is longterm money and I ’ m explicitly trying to outperform the SP 500 fully accepting higher volatility and drawdowns . I already have a growth and techheavy portfolio . Roughly speaking my current exposure looks like this • NBIS AI infrastructure 35 % • ASTS satellite connectivity 20 % • GOOG 15 % • RKLB space launch 10 % • MU semiconductors 5 % • XAR aerospace defense ETF 5 % • Small ETH exposure and other minor positions 10 % So I ’ m already very far from the index intentionally . I am looking for stock picks especially ideas that could reasonably outperform over a long horizon and that would complement or strengthen this portfolio rather than just add more of the same exposure . I ’ m interested in • highquality growth • infrastructure or platform businesses • situations with strong longterm Not_looking to trade or gamble and not_looking for shortterm hype . I ’ m more interested in ideas with a clear multiyear thesis . Curious to hear what names you ’ d be looking at if you were deploying fresh capital with this objective . Thanks ."

      "selftext": "In an extraordinary display of confidence that has sent ripples through Silicon Valley’s executive corridors, ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott has committed $20 million of his personal wealth to purchase company stock while simultaneously pledging to remain at the helm through 2030. This dual announcement represents one of the most significant insider stock purchases by a sitting technology CEO in recent years and signals a dramatic vote of confidence in the enterprise software company’s long-term trajectory at a time when the sector faces mounting pressure from artificial intelligence disruption and economic uncertainty. According to Business Insider, McDermott’s substantial investment comes as ServiceNow navigates a critical inflection point in its evolution from workflow automation provider to AI-powered enterprise platform. The move is particularly noteworthy given that most executives typically receive stock compensation rather than purchasing shares with after-tax personal funds, making this transaction a powerful statement about McDermott’s conviction in the company’s strategic direction. The timing of this announcement carries special significance as ServiceNow competes against tech giants like Microsoft, Salesforce, and Oracle in the rapidly evolving enterprise software market. McDermott’s commitment to lead the company for another six years provides stability and continuity that investors increasingly value in an era where CEO tenures have been shrinking and leadership transitions have become more frequent and disruptive across the technology sector.

      "title": "contrarian names I like better for 2026 than MSFT",
      "selftext": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that’s weighing on it right now. Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups. These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears, but each has concrete near-term pops from production ramps, restructurings, or demand surges. Rivian (RIVN) trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears. It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales, way below Tesla. The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal, Illinois, with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June. Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026, pushing toward breakeven margins. Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and off-road focus that Tesla’s Cybertruck hasn’t fully nailed yet, plus locked-in supplier costs for higher-volume profitability. FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73% drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America. P/E at 4 times looks dirt cheap, 96% below peers, with earnings growth projected over 50%. Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring (shifting production to lower-cost spots) drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026. The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully, and new direct-sales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control. Fluor (FLR) around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82% reimbursable backlog to cut risk. GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026, plus SMR work. The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales, unlocking cash for buybacks. Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energy/infra projects, and long-term engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this. Ciena (CIEN) at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times, 30% discount to sector. Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs. EPS upgrades run strong (15 up, zero down recently), and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion, up about 24% at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog. The moat strengthens as the “nervous system” for AI clusters with high-capacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites, where competitors lag on speed and low-latency scale. L3Harris (LHX) around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spin-off. The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026, creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core. This unlocks value in higher-margin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyber/space. Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale (from Aerojet acquisition) that’s hard to replicate fast, plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp. I hope i am right.",

      "selftext_processed": "I just posted about MSFT and the OpenAI concentration risk that ’ s weighing on it right now . Here are five other contrarian names I like better for 2026 setups . These got hammered in 2025 on sector weakness or execution fears but each has concrete nearterm pops from production ramps restructurings or demand surges . Rivian RIVN trades at 18 to 19 billion market cap after EV slowdown fears . It sells at 3 to 4 times forward sales way below Tesla . The big trigger hits early 2026 when R2 production starts in Normal Illinois with validation builds already rolling off the line in January and first customer deliveries expected by June . Volumes should double or more as R2 ramps on a single shift through 2026 pushing toward breakeven margins . Rivian carves a moat in adventure EVs with rugged design and offroad focus that Tesla ’ s Cybertruck hasn ’ t fully nailed yet plus lockedin supplier costs for highervolume profitability . FMC sits at about 2 billion market cap after a 73 % drop last year from weak ag demand and cash collection issues in South America . PE at 4 times looks dirt cheap 96 % below peers with earnings growth projected over 50 % . Latin America rebound plus aggressive cost cuts and restructuring shifting production to lowercost spots drive FCF back to 285 million in 2026 . The moat comes from proprietary crop protection chemicals that generics struggle to match fully and new directsales models to big growers bypass distributors for better margins and control . Fluor FLR around 7 to 8 billion builds data centers and nuclear with 82 % reimbursable backlog to cut risk . GPU and hyperscaler demand ramps hard in 2026 plus SMR work . The NuScale stake monetization wraps by end of Q2 2026 via structured share sales unlocking cash for buybacks . Moat builds from reimbursable contracts that limit downside on big energyinfra projects and longterm engineering edge in nuclear and data center construction where few players scale like this . Ciena CIEN at 34 to 36 billion has a PEG of 1.24 times 30 % discount to sector . Optical networking explodes from AI data center interconnect needs . EPS upgrades run strong 15 up zero down recently and management guides FY26 revenue to 5.7 to 6.1 billion up about 24 % at midpoint on a 5 billion backlog . The moat strengthens as the “ nervous system ” for AI clusters with highcapacity coherent optics that handle massive data moves between buildings or sites where competitors lag on speed and lowlatency scale . L3Harris LHX around 67 billion in defense tech gets a jolt from the Missile Solutions spinoff . The Pentagon invests 1 billion convertible preferred that turns to equity on IPO in second half 2026 creating a standalone rocket motor company while L3Harris keeps control and a leaner core . This unlocks value in highermargin propulsion systems amid budget tailwinds for missiles and cyberspace . Moat grows from solid rocket motor production scale from Aerojet acquisition that ’ s hard to replicate fast plus direct DoD partnership for capacity ramp . I hope i am right ."

The most noteworthy point: capex planned for 2026 is between $115 and $135 billion, a very significant increase from $72 billion in 2025. The market reacted positively (the stock is up about +9-10% today, trading around $730-735), while Microsoft, delivering a similar message on AI investments, is down more than 10%. This divergence is interesting. On one hand, investors appear to be endorsing Meta’s strategy: strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization, exploding DAUs, and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers. On the other hand, a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks: potential overcapacity in data centers, delays in generating incremental cash flows, or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown. I’m neither compulsively selling nor buying here, but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious. Historically, when the market heavily rewards large-scale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability, it can sometimes precede later re-evaluations. Apart from that, January 2026 is shaping up to be a triple-threat market moment: * Risk of a government shutdown, * Precious metals breaking all-time historical levels, * And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window. **Why the market is reacting this way** Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that aren't dependent on government stability. That's why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs (gold recently trading around $5,070–$5,268/oz as of late January 2026, amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31). At the same time, tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure. Software is getting cheaper to scale, but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive, forcing a re-evaluation of valuations. Personally, this kind of announcement makes me uneasy. I’ve seen past cycles where the market celebrated massive CAPEX long before returns actually materialized. What matters with Meta today isn’t just the size of the AI investments, but the timing: the market is rewarding the story before the economics are fully proven. A +10% move after earnings is impressive, but it’s not yet proof that $115–135B will translate into real shareholder value. For me, the more sensible approach right now is to stay defensive, focus on the short term (both long and short), and only scale exposure when clearer “green lights” start to appear. That's why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week (easy long and short exposure, leverage to improve capital efficiency). How do you read this situation? * Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance? * Are you trimming or staying neutral, waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments? * Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names? I’m curious about your takes, especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context (interest rates, ad growth, competition). Let’s discuss calmly and factually.",

      "selftext_processed": "META reported solid Q4 2025 results yesterday EPS of $ 8.88 vs $ 8.19 expected revenue of $ 59.9 billion above expectations and particularly strong Q1 2026 guidance projected revenue of $ 53.556.5 billion well above the consensus around $ 51 billion . The most noteworthy point capex planned for 2026 is between $ 115 and $ 135 billion a very significant increase from $ 72 billion in 2025 . The market reacted positively the stock is up about 910 % today trading around $ 730735 while Microsoft delivering a similar message on AI investments is down more than 10 % . This divergence is interesting . On one hand investors appear to be endorsing Meta ’ s strategy strong advertising monetization thanks to real AI optimization exploding DAUs and a perceived closer and more tangible return on investment compared to some peers . On the other hand a capex of this magnitude legitimately raises questions about risks potential overcapacity in data centers delays in generating incremental cash flows or increased sensitivity to a macroeconomic slowdown . I ’ m neither_compulsively selling nor buying here but this level of euphoria around such massive spending makes me cautious . Historically when the market heavily rewards largescale investment spending without demanding immediate proof of profitability it can sometimes precede later reevaluations . Apart from that January 2026 is shaping up to be a triplethreat market moment Risk of a government shutdown Precious metals breaking alltime historical levels And major Big Tech earnings colliding in the same narrow window . Why the market is reacting this way Political uncertainty has weakened the dollar and driven investors toward assets that arent dependent on government stability . Thats why gold and silver are smashing through historical highs gold recently trading around $ 5070– $ 5268oz as of late January 2026 amid ongoing partial shutdown risks with funding deadlines around January 30–31 . At the same time tech is under pressure as capital shifts away from pure growth plays toward AI infrastructure . Software is getting cheaper to scale but the hardware powering AI is becoming more expensive forcing a reevaluation of valuations . Personally this kind of announcement makes me uneasy . I ’ ve seen past cycles where the market celebrated massive CAPEX long before returns actually materialized . What matters with Meta today isn ’ t just the size of the AI investments but the timing the market is rewarding the story before the economics are fully proven . A 10 % move after earnings is impressive but it ’ s not_yet proof that $ 115–135B will translate into real shareholder value . For me the more sensible approach right now is to stay defensive focus on the short term both long and short and only scale exposure when clearer “ green lights ” start to appear . Thats why I still find Bitget Stock Futures particularly interesting this week easy long and short exposure leverage to improve capital efficiency . How do you read this situation Are you increasing your exposure to META following this momentum and guidance Are you trimming or staying neutral waiting for more visibility on the ROI of these AI investments Or are you simply observing the divergence with the other Big Tech names I ’ m curious about your takes especially on how you assess the sustainability of this capex level in the current context interest rates ad growth competition . Let ’ s discuss calmly and factually ."

      "selftext": "In long-term portfolio construction, being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default, supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments. Over extended periods, idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark. At the same time, some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing, drawdown deployment, or reduced forced selling during market stress. While this approach may lower expected returns, it could potentially improve risk-adjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented. From a structural perspective, this raises a broader question: should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management, or simply an inefficiency that long-term investors should minimize? For those focused on long horizons, how do you think about this tradeoff in practice? Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework, or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested.?",

      "selftext_processed": "In longterm portfolio construction being fully invested is often presented as the optimal default supported by historical return data and opportunity cost arguments . Over extended periods idle capital tends to reduce nominal returns relative to a fully invested benchmark . At the same time some investors intentionally preserve flexibility through modest allocations that allow rebalancing drawdown deployment or reduced forced selling during market stress . While this approach may lower expected returns it could potentially improve riskadjusted outcomes depending on how it is implemented . From a structural perspective this raises a broader question should flexibility be viewed primarily as a form of risk management or simply an inefficiency that longterm investors should minimize For those focused on long horizons how do you think about this tradeoff in practice Do you evaluate flexibility explicitly within your asset allocation framework or treat it as noise relative to staying fully invested ."

I can't be the only Boglehead that has a spreadsheet of the most recent underlying holdings of the vanguard ETFs I own, with the weights for each stock. I wanted to know if maybe I'm just crazy or if this is something that others also have an interest in? Additionally, does anyone else wish they could see the individual dividends of the underlying holdings get paid, even in accumulating funds, ie not actually have the cash paid into my account, but have my Vanguard Brokerage account tell me that with my number of ETF units I 'earned $X.xx in dividends today from Apple' even though it stayed within the accumulation fund and I never actually saw the cash?",

Do you also like to “gamble” with a small portion of your portfolio, or do you strictly stick to a passive investment strategy and keep things simple?",

      "title": "Why Abu Dhabi? (And why investors are now choosing it over Dubai)",
      "selftext": "LONG READ WARNING! :) Hello everyone, as a property investment consultant & broker in the UAE, lately, a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market. I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE, but isn't sure where to start, which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet. I'll give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market & explain the best areas to invest in. To give you a little background information, Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital, Abu Dhabi. The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago (Dubai has been offering this since 2002, for comparison). In the first half of 2025, there were only 4000 new off-plan units launched in Abu Dhabi, whereas in the same time frame, there were about 65,000 launched in Dubai. Abu Dhabi's population is currently growing much faster than Dubai's (twice as much in the last year), and continues to grow rapidly, so the rental demand & yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage. Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours & experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabi's real estate market. In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD (+39% YoY). \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at: • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer off-plan developments but with very high potential: • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO: \\- ALDAR (They lead the market & have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi. Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out & Aldar properties hold their value very well) \\- SOBHA \\- MODON \\- SAAS Properties \\- Bloom Holding \\- OBJECT 1 \\- ICT \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI: For reference, when you buy off-plan property directly from a developer in the UAE, whether you're a resident or a foreign investor, you have the option to go with a \"payment plan\" which will usually look something like this \"60/40 10% down\" or \"65/35 5% down\" and there are a lot of different options. The breakdown goes as follows: For 60/40 - 10% down: 10% of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2% govt fees 50% is paid in 4-6 installments over the course of (usually) 3 years while the property is under development 40% is paid once the project is completed & your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the \"Early stage flip\" & \"Pre-handover exit\" Early stage flip: Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment, 5% or 10% in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply (because not all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want) and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch. Basically before the next installment is due (usually around 6 months from purchase), investors resell the contract at a premium, typically in the range of $50,000-$150,000, depending on the project. Pre-handover edit: investors continue paying installments over the construction period. By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due, market value has often appreciated significantly, especially when the asset is from a top developer & in a strong location. So for example, a unit purchased at $460K may be valued at around $730K-$820K before handover, allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term. Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term, capital appreciation can be a lot higher, especially in prime locations. The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling. \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ Now let's expand on the areas i mentioned earlier, 1. YAS ISLAND: \\- Entertainment + Tourism Hub (Beaches, Golf, Theme parks, Nightlife, Sports, Concerts, MMA, F1, etc.) \\- Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi. (This is important because it will further boost tourism & demand in the area and drive property value up.) Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6.5-8.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 12-18% YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx. 8-11% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $400K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$800K • Villas & Townhouses - $1.3M-$4m+ 2. SAADIYAT ISLAND (my personal favorite): \\- Lifestyle, Cultural District & Luxury: \\- Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest long-term real estate investments in the UAE. The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers, supported by limited supply & prestige branding. Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI. Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years. The Island is Abu Dhabi's art & cultural district & has museums such as the Louvre, the Guggenheim, The national history museum & Sheikh Zayed museum. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 5.5-7.5% • Villa Value Growth approx. 15-28% YoY (one of the highest in the UAE) • Apartment Value Growth approx. 10-15% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $300K-$600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $700K-$1.4M+ • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $1.5M+ • Villas & Townhouses - $3M+ 3. AL REEM ISLAND: \\- More affordable than Saadiyat & Yas island but still very popular. A great community that's popular with younger professionals and expats. Stats as of Q4 2025: • Rental Yield 6-9% • Apartment Value Growth approx. 7-12% YoY Typical Prices: • Studio Apartments - $150K-$250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $250K-$500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $500K-$750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $750K-$1.2M • 4+ Bedroom Villas - $1.7M-$2.5M+ 4. HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND \\- A sports & lifestyle hub. Mostly beachfront living, with a focus on sports & wellness. Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now. All the projects launched there are selling out instantly. For example, the most recent one was \"Bashayer\" by MODON. It sold out in 1 day, generating 3 Billion AED in sales. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3+ Bedroom Villas - $1.2M-$2.5M 5. FAHID ISLAND \\- Fahid Island is developed by Aldar & is a wellness-focused island positioned between Yas Island & Saadiyat Island & one of the most anticipated master-planned developments in Abu Dhabi. Its designed around low-density living, walkability, greenery, beaches and curated community facilities & Its attracting strong investor & end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation & the islands strategic location. Typical Prices: • 1 Bedroom Apartments - $650K-$800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments - $850K-$1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments - $1.2M-$2M 5. RAMHAN ISLAND \\- Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills, focusing on private waterfront villas, private beaches & resort-style living. It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabi's most exclusive residential projects. The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors & end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value, privacy and long term capital appreciation potential. Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle that's still close to the city. Typical Prices: • 3-7 Bedroom Villas - $2.5M - $10M Personally, I really believe in Saadiyat Island, Yas Island & Hudairiyat as long-term investments. I purchased off-plan property in Saadiyat myself last year & hope to invest in another project there soon as well. Given the market history, the governments investments & support in developing the areas, and the very limited space left to build, i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce. The scarcity combined with their prime locations, makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now. To give you an idea, The off-plan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $1M (I've only paid the 5% down payment + 2% + first installment so far, in total about $120k), I could already sell for a $70k-$85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat. If you'd like to do a bit of research yourself, look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island, for example, from last year like \"Mamsha Gardens\" & \"The Row\", then look at the current resale prices they're listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT. This will give you an idea of how fast off-plan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat. Since i'm mostly explaining off-plan investments here and also since theres of course, a lot more information about off-plan, the secondary market & UAE real estate in general, for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further, feel free to ask & I'm happy to answer!",

      "selftext_processed": "LONG READ WARNING Hello everyone as a property investment consultant broker in the UAE lately a lot of my clients have been foreign investors looking for property in Dubai and many are surprised when i steer them towards Abu Dhabi instead of the more familiar Dubai Market . I decided to put together this post for anyone who has been curious or thinking about investing in real estate in the UAE but isnt sure where to start which areas are worth considering or which city might be a safer bet . Ill give you some insight on the Abu Dhabi Market explain the best areas to invest in . To give you a little background information Now is the best time for real estate investments in the capital Abu Dhabi . The Abu Dhabi real estate market has really only opened up full freehold ownership to foreign investors around 6ish years ago Dubai has been offering this since 2002 for comparison . In the first half of 2025 there were only 4000 new offplan units launched in Abu Dhabi whereas in the same time frame there were about 65000 launched in Dubai . Abu Dhabis population is currently growing much faster than Dubais twice as much in the last year and continues to grow rapidly so the rental demand yield in Abu Dhabi is higher due to the shortage . Residential Projects from the top developers sell out in less than 24 hours experienced investors understand the value of Abu Dhabis real estate market . In H1 2025 the property transaction value in AD was 14.1B USD 39 % YoY . _____ The key areas in Abu Dhabi investors should be looking at • Yas Island • Saadiyat Island • Al Reem Island Newer offplan developments but with very high potential • Fahid Island • Ramhan Island • Hudairiyat Island _____ The Best Developers in Abu Dhabi IMO ALDAR They lead the market have a huge role in the development of Abu Dhabi . Any project they launch is almost instantly sold out Aldar properties hold their value very well SOBHA MODON SAAS Properties Bloom Holding OBJECT 1 ICT _____ DEVELOPER PAYMENT PLANS IN ABU DHABI For reference when you buy offplan property directly from a developer in the UAE whether youre a resident or a foreign investor you have the option to go with a payment plan which will usually look something like this 6040 10 % down or 6535 5 % down and there are a lot of different options . The breakdown goes as follows For 6040 10 % down 10 % of property price is paid as a down payment along with 2 % govt fees 50 % is paid in 46 installments over the course of usually 3 years while the property is under development 40 % is paid once the project is completed your unit is handed over to you Two very common strategies here are the Early stage flip Prehandover exit Early stage flip Investors get a unit at launch with a relatively low down payment 5 % or 10 % in projects that are expected to sell out rapidly due to strong demand and limited supply because not_all interested buyers are able to secure a unit they want and units often trade at a premium shortly after launch . Basically before the next installment is due usually around 6 months from purchase investors resell the contract at a premium typically in the range of $ 50000 $ 150000 depending on the project . Prehandover edit investors continue paying installments over the construction period . By the time the project nears completion and the handover payment is nearly due market value has often appreciated significantly especially when the asset is from a top developer in a strong location . So for example a unit purchased at $ 460K may be valued at around $ 730K $ 820K before handover allowing the investor to exit prior to the handover and realize capital appreciation without holding long term . Of course for investors who are willing to hold longer term capital appreciation can be a lot higher especially in prime locations . The strategies i mentioned above are typically used by investors who prefer shorter holding periods and faster capital recycling . _____ Now lets expand on the areas i mentioned earlier 1 . YAS ISLAND Entertainment Tourism Hub Beaches Golf Theme parks Nightlife Sports Concerts MMA F1 etc . Also the location of the upcoming 2030 DISNEYLAND Abu Dhabi . This is important because it will further boost tourism demand in the area and drive property value up . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 6.58.5 % • Villa Value Growth approx . 1218 % YoY • Apartment Value Growth approx . 811 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 300K $ 400K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 400K $ 500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 500K $ 800K • Villas Townhouses $ 1.3M $ 4m 2 . SAADIYAT ISLAND my personal favorite Lifestyle Cultural District Luxury Investing in property in Saadiyat is widely thought of as one of the strongest longterm real estate investments in the UAE . The island consistently shows high demand from local and international buyers supported by limited supply prestige branding . Saadiyat is also a magnet for HNWI . Property value in Saadiyat has doubled over the last few years . The Island is Abu Dhabis art cultural district has museums such as the Louvre the Guggenheim The national history museum Sheikh Zayed museum . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 5.57.5 % • Villa Value Growth approx . 1528 % YoY one of the highest in the UAE • Apartment Value Growth approx . 1015 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 300K $ 600K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 700K $ 1.4M • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 1.5M • Villas Townhouses $ 3M 3 . AL REEM ISLAND More affordable than Saadiyat Yas island but still very popular . A great community thats popular with younger professionals and expats . Stats as of Q4 2025 • Rental Yield 69 % • Apartment Value Growth approx . 712 % YoY Typical Prices • Studio Apartments $ 150K $ 250K • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 250K $ 500K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 500K $ 750K • 3 Bedroom Apartments $ 750K $ 1.2M • 4 Bedroom Villas $ 1.7M $ 2.5M 4 . HUDAIRIYAT ISLAND A sports lifestyle hub . Mostly beachfront living with a focus on sports wellness . Hudairiyat is REALLY in demand right now . All the projects launched there are selling out instantly . For example the most recent one was Bashayer by MODON . It sold out in 1 day generating 3 Billion AED in sales . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 750K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Villas $ 1.2M $ 2.5M 5 . FAHID ISLAND Fahid Island is developed by Aldar is a wellnessfocused island positioned between Yas Island Saadiyat Island one of the most anticipated masterplanned developments in Abu Dhabi . Its designed around lowdensity living walkability greenery beaches and curated community facilities Its attracting strong investor end user interest mostly because of Aldars reputation the islands strategic location . Typical Prices • 1 Bedroom Apartments $ 650K $ 800K • 2 Bedroom Apartments $ 850K $ 1.1M • 3 Bedroom Apartments $ 1.2M $ 2M 5 . RAMHAN ISLAND Ramhan is a luxury natural island project developed by Eagle Hills focusing on private waterfront villas private beaches resortstyle living . It has VERY limited supply which makes it one of Abu Dhabis most exclusive residential projects . The island only has villas and each phase of the project only releases a small number of units so investors end users are attracted by the islands scarcity value privacy and long term capital appreciation potential . Ramhan is especially appealing to HNW buyers who are looking for a more private island lifestyle thats still close to the city . Typical Prices • 37 Bedroom Villas $ 2.5M $ 10M Personally I really believe in Saadiyat Island Yas Island Hudairiyat as longterm investments . I purchased offplan property in Saadiyat myself last year hope to invest in another project there soon as well . Given the market history the governments investments support in developing the areas and the very limited space left to build i just feel like options on these islands are becoming increasingly scarce . The scarcity combined with their prime locations makes them some of the best investments in the UAE right now . To give you an idea The offplan property i purchased from the developer last Aug for $ 1M Ive only paid the 5 % down payment 2 % first installment so far in total about $ 120k I could already sell for a $ 70k $ 85k profit today if i went for an early exit strat . If youd like to do a bit of research yourself look at the developer launch prices of projects in Saadiyat Island for example from last year like Mamsha Gardens The Row then look at the current resale prices theyre listed at on platforms like propertyfinder.ae or BAYUT . This will give you an idea of how fast offplan property value appreciates in an area like Saadiyat . Since im mostly explaining offplan investments here and also since theres of course a lot more information about offplan the secondary market UAE real estate in general for anyone that has more questions or wants to discuss further feel free to ask Im happy to answer"

      "selftext": "From [The Guardian](#selection-1451.0-1523.194): The surge in the gold price is showing no sign of abating, as bullion continues to soar. Gold has jumped over the $5,500 an ounce level this morning, just three days after hitting $5,000 for the first time, taking its gains so far this year to almost 30% (!). It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets, looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar, which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency’s year‑to‑date softness. That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement, boosting gold’s attractiveness. As Chris Beauchamp, Chief Market Analyst at IG, explains: “That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher, as the price keeps climbing, and given renewed impetus by Trump’s comments on the dollar. This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats, as it reinforces their thesis. “Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum, something comes along to rescue it. So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar, the future for gold looks bright indeed.” Concerns around the independence of America’s central bank are also lifting gold. Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night, it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year. That could weaken the dollar further, and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price. The rise in precious metals prices is “breathtaking and profoundly scary”, warns Robin Brooks, senior fellow at Brookings Institute. He writes: “The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum. “At the same time, we’re seeing government bond markets in high-debt countries like Japan under severe pressure, even as there’s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden, Norway and Switzerland. Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger. We’re at the start of a global debt crisis, with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away out-of-control debt. Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “safe haven” bid as part of this phenomenon.”",

      "selftext_processed": "From The Guardianselection1451.01523.194 The surge in the gold price is showing no_sign of abating as bullion continues to soar . Gold has jumped over the $ 5500 an ounce level this morning just three days after hitting $ 5000 for the first time taking its gains so far this year to almost 30 % . It powered higher as investors continue to rush into safe haven assets looking for protection against geopolitical and economic uncertainty . Precious metals are also benefiting from the weaker dollar which has lurched lower after president Trump indicated this week he was comfortable with the currency ’ s year‑to‑date softness . That only encouraged fears of monetary debasement boosting gold ’ s attractiveness . As Chris Beauchamp Chief Market Analyst at IG explains “ That sound you hear is that of 2026 gold targets being furiously revised higher as the price keeps climbing and given renewed impetus by Trump ’ s comments on the dollar . This will have fans of the debasement trade cheering in their seats as it reinforces their thesis . “ Each time precious seem at risk of running out of bullish momentum something comes along to rescue it . So long as international investors keep dumping the dollar the future for gold looks bright indeed. ” Concerns around the independence of America ’ s central bank are also lifting gold . Although the US Federal Reserve resisted pressure from Trump and held interest rates last night it may cut rates once a new chair has been installed to replace Jerome Powell later this year . That could weaken the dollar further and lift inflation – two conditions which are good for the gold price . The rise in precious metals prices is “ breathtaking and profoundly scary ” warns Robin Brooks senior fellow at Brookings Institute . He writes “ The rise in gold is part of something much bigger… all precious metals prices are going through the roof and gold is a laggard compared to silver and platinum . “ At the same time we ’ re seeing government bond markets in highdebt countries like Japan under severe pressure even as there ’ s a flight to safety into countries with low debt like Sweden Norway and Switzerland . Gold is therefore a symptom of something much bigger . We ’ re at the start of a global debt crisis with markets increasingly fearful governments will attempt to inflate away outofcontrol debt . Gold is just one of many assets that are getting a “ safe haven ” bid as part of this phenomenon . ”"

      "selftext": "Hello, I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing. I am tackling it 3 ways. 1. Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $100 when creating a new account and depositing $100. Not sure if I chose it or not, but they put the $100+$100 in some mixed tech stock. Google, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon, and Microsoft. From then until now the $200 grew to $268.12. 2. To dabble in Crypto mining, I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash. Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit, but it seems to be hanging in there. They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC, ie, about $21. I am probably losing money due to electricity cost, but they are heating my house :) I intend to move them to my off-grid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment, basically free electricity. It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost, but that is already money down the drain. 3. I took advantage of a Rakuten $150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $200 within a month. I just bought $210 worth of BTC which had a $3.10 fee. Will have to wait for the $150 CB. On the surface, my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something. I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys, but it is a start. I suspect my 36a of off-grid property in AZ was my best purchase. Are you guys on team crypto, or team stocks, or perhaps team real estate? I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made, and I couldn't pass up the CB on the Kraken account, but not sure where I should move the money? Thoughts? Thanks!",

      "selftext_processed": "Hello I thought I would make 2026 my year for investing . I am tackling it 3 ways . 1 . Back in May of 2024 I took advantage of a Schwab deal to match $ 100 when creating a new account and depositing $ 100 . Not_sure if I chose it or not_but they put the $ 100 $ 100 in some mixed tech stock . Google Apple Nvidia Amazon and Microsoft . From then until now the $ 200 grew to $ 268.12 . 2 . To dabble in Crypto mining I bought a couple small miners to mine Zcash . Seems it was one of the tokens that was showing some growth but got whacked with the developers all quit but it seems to be hanging in there . They have been mining less than a month and have earned .06 ZEC ie about $ 21 . I am probably losing money due to electricity cost but they are heating my house I intend to move them to my offgrid property where I have a solar array and having already made the investment basically free electricity . It will take a long time just to recoup the hardware cost but that is already money down the drain . 3 . I took advantage of a Rakuten $ 150 CB by opening a Kraken account and needing to spend $ 200 within a month . I just bought $ 210 worth of BTC which had a $ 3.10 fee . Will have to wait for the $ 150 CB . On the surface my senile mind thinks the Schwab investment has the best potential unless crypto starts doing something . I realize these are piddling amounts and pocket change to you guys but it is a start . I suspect my 36a of offgrid property in AZ was my best purchase . Are you guys on team crypto or team stocks or perhaps team real estate I am going to forge ahead with mining crypto as the hardware investment was made and I couldnt pass up the CB on the Kraken account but not_sure where I should move the money Thoughts Thanks"

      "selftext": "hola fella regards. ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it, without having spend the nearly $100k that most sell-side shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports? DBS has you covered! here's the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with \"equity research filetype:pdf\" on google. scroll a bit down, and you'll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock. [for example, just searching up \"CVX equity reseach filetype:pdf\" got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron]( 2. once you're there, press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at. using the chevron example, you change it from [ to [ by just by changing that last part at the end (make sure to capitalize it!) i have no idea what type of [security pre-cautions]( DBS has employed, but nearly every mega-cap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see. for example... **mag 7 coverage from DBS** Tesla - [ Meta - [ Apple - [ Google - [ Nvidia - [ Amazon - [ Microsoft - [ yep... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available. you know... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too. i honestly have no idea when they're going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not to bring up. if you've ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings... here's your shot. **edit: i've managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not only publish their analyst reports, but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a \"report\" analysts shit out when they need to justify upgrading or downgrading. all you need to do is search \"industry dbs filetype:pdf\"** technology outlook: [ 2026 outlook: [ weekly macro insights from their chief economist (link auto-downloads the pdf): [google

      "selftext_processed": "hola fella regards . ever wanted to see what the analysts downgraded your favourite stock really has to say about why they shat all over it without having spend the nearly $ 100k that most sellside shops expect you to pay for their shitty reports DBS has you covered heres the method 1. search up the stock ticker of the company you want with equity research filetypepdf on google . scroll a bit down and youll eventually be able to find the most recent DBS report available regarding the stock . for example just searching up CVX equity reseach filetypepdf got me the report they published literally 2 days ago on chevron 2. once youre there press the web address and change it from the company you had before to another company you wanted to look at . using the chevron example you change it from to by just by changing that last part at the end make sure to capitalize it i have no_idea what type of security precautions DBS has employed but nearly every megacap that they have covered is literally publicly available for anyone to see . for example ... mag 7 coverage from DBS Tesla Meta Apple Google Nvidia Amazon Microsoft yep ... they all work and literally all the most recent reports they have available . you know ... the same analyst reports that wall street firms pay hundreds of thousands to get continuous access too . i honestly have no_idea when theyre going to patch this up but this is too fucking hilarious not_to bring up . if youve ever wanted to see how the people paid to lose money think when it comes to earnings ... heres your shot . edit ive managed to find that these motherfuckers somehow manage to not_only publish their analyst reports but whole industry and sectors reports that are actually more detailed than a

      "selftext": "I’ve been researching a small Finnish company called **Canatu**, and it’s one of the most interesting investments I’ve come across in a while. It’s not a semiconductor company, not an AI company, and not a software business. It sits much deeper in the stack, at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on. ***Quick disclaimer:*** *this is a deep-tech, supply-chain-driven idea. It’s not a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics. If that’s not your thing, feel free to skip. Also, none of this is investment advice.* The core of the thesis is simple: advanced chips are now constrained by physics, not software. As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography, the limiting factor is no longer design, but materials. When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers, even microscopic weaknesses become billion-dollar problems. At the center of this process is the photomask, the blueprint of the chip. To protect it from contamination, EUV machines use an ultra-thin membrane called a pellicle. If a single dust particle hits the mask, yield can collapse instantly. Pellicles are therefore mandatory, but existing silicon-based pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases. This is where Canatu enters the picture. They’ve developed carbon-nanotube (CNT) pellicles that can withstand far higher heat, deform far less, and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions. As EUV systems transition toward High-NA EUV, those properties shift from nice to have to necessary. What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don’t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer. Instead, they’re trying to scale via a licensing + tool model: * Reactor sales (specialized production equipment) * Proprietary consumables (inputs needed to run the reactor) * Per-unit licensing fees (royalty for each pellicle produced) So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity, while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard. That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables, not permanent components. As EUV power rises, pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases. Even if High-NA EUV is a minority of wafer volume, it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate. From a market structure perspective, this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV. Think ARM rather than Intel, or Entegris rather than TSMC. If chips are made on ASML machines, something must sit between the photons and the mask, and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles. There are also real validation signals. Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST, a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung’s ecosystem. Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients (commonly speculated as Samsung + TSMC). Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly. One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from Low-NA to High-NA EUV, because this is where the non-linear upside comes from. The key insight is that pellicle demand does not scale with wafer volume, but with exposure intensity. High-NA tools use higher source power, more EUV layers per wafer, and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles, which shortens their usable life. In practical terms, a High-NA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a Low-NA tool. When you combine a slow but steady increase in High-NA share with higher burn rates, you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption. Even under conservative assumptions, my model shows pellicle demand in leading-edge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as High-NA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade. This is still a small-cap (\\~€300M), listed on Nasdaq First North Finland, it is a SPAC, so some future dilution from warrants and earn-outs is expected. That said, I find the asymmetry compelling. This isn’t a bet on which AI company wins. It’s a bet that physics does not negotiate, and that when an industry hits hard material limits, small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable. I’m curious how others here view this kind of deep supply-chain infrastructure play, especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience. Happy to be challenged.",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been researching a small Finnish company called Canatu and it ’ s one of the most interesting investments I ’ ve come across in a while . It ’ s not_a semiconductor company not_an AI company and not_a software business . It sits much deeper in the stack at a physical bottleneck the entire AI and advanced chip industry quietly depends on . Quick disclaimer this is a deeptech supplychaindriven idea . It ’ s not_a clean financial multiple story and it requires some comfort with semiconductor manufacturing and physics . If that ’ s not_your thing feel free to skip . Also none of this is investment advice . The core of the thesis is simple advanced chips are now constrained by physics not_software . As chipmakers push toward smaller nodes using EUV lithography the limiting factor is no_longer design but materials . When you push hundreds of watts of extreme ultraviolet light through a system measured in nanometers even microscopic weaknesses become billiondollar problems . At the center of this process is the photomask the blueprint of the chip . To protect it from contamination EUV machines use an ultrathin membrane called a pellicle . If a single dust particle hits the mask yield can collapse instantly . Pellicles are therefore mandatory but existing siliconbased pellicles are approaching their physical limits as EUV power increases . This is where Canatu enters the picture . They ’ ve developed carbonnanotube CNT pellicles that can withstand far higher heat deform far less and transmit more EUV light than conventional solutions . As EUV systems transition toward HighNA EUV those properties shift from nice to have to necessary . What makes Canatu particularly interesting is that they don ’ t plan to become a huge centralized manufacturer . Instead they ’ re trying to scale via a licensing tool model Reactor sales specialized production equipment Proprietary consumables inputs needed to run the reactor Perunit licensing fees royalty for each pellicle produced So the customer carries capex and scaling complexity while Canatu captures recurring economics if the technology becomes standard . That model creates leverage because pellicles are consumables not_permanent components . As EUV power rises pellicle lifetimes shorten and replacement frequency increases . Even if HighNA EUV is a minority of wafer volume it can drive a majority of pellicle demand due to higher burn rate . From a market structure perspective this looks less like a classic manufacturer and more like a materials toll booth embedded into EUV . Think ARM rather than Intel or Entegris rather than TSMC . If chips are made on ASML machines something must sit between the photons and the mask and that something increasingly looks like CNT pellicles . There are also real validation signals . Canatu signed a licensing deal with FST a Korean supplier often interpreted as a bridge into Samsung ’ s ecosystem . Management has referenced two major Asian semiconductor clients commonly speculated as Samsung TSMC . Semiconductor revenue already dominates their sales and has been growing quickly . One part of my research focused on modeling how pellicle demand scales as logic fabs gradually transition from LowNA to HighNA EUV because this is where the nonlinear upside comes from . The key insight is that pellicle demand does not_scale with wafer volume but with exposure intensity . HighNA tools use higher source power more EUV layers per wafer and impose much harsher thermal stress on pellicles which shortens their usable life . In practical terms a HighNA scanner consumes pellicles several times faster than a LowNA tool . When you combine a slow but steady increase in HighNA share with higher burn rates you get a demand curve where a minority of wafers can drive a majority of pellicle consumption . Even under conservative assumptions my model shows pellicle demand in leadingedge logic fabs growing multiples faster than wafer output itself as HighNA adoption progresses through the second half of the decade . This is still a smallcap €300M listed on Nasdaq First North Finland it is a SPAC so some future dilution from warrants and earnouts is expected . That said I find the asymmetry compelling . This isn ’ t a bet on which AI company wins . It ’ s a bet that physics does not_negotiate and that when an industry hits hard material limits small specialized suppliers can quietly become indispensable . I ’ m curious how others here view this kind of deep supplychain infrastructure play especially anyone with semiconductor or lithography experience . Happy to be challenged ."

      "selftext": "*Preface:* I am not looking for financial advice, I will continue to do my own research, I am mainly looking for new funds to explore and expand my perspectives on my strategy. I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments, even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor and/or the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in. I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction, so I am hoping that I can do that here. I’ll also say upfront: Bogleheads, I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult, but I am hoping to avoid that debate here. Thank you in advance. All of my money is now with Fidelity. I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far, especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees. **Current balances:** * Roth IRA: \\~$90k * 401k: \\~$95k * Taxable (TOD): \\~$18k **Current allocations:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 25% FDCPX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 65% FSELX * 25% FXAIX * 10% AGTHX (legacy holding from American Funds) I’m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy, but I’m starting to think more about diversification. I’m especially curious whether there are any non-tech or non-semiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong long-term returns. I know I want to replace FDCPX, since it’s also tech-heavy and overlaps with FSELX, I am just not sure with what yet. I’ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX, but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX, which appears more growth- and tech-concentrated. **Restructure plan as of now:** Roth IRA * 50% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 15% FSENX * 10% FFFCX 401(k) * 100% FDKLX (Target Date 2060) Taxable (TOD) * 40% FSELX * 25% FCNTX * 20% FSENX * 10% AGTHX * 5% FFFCX I’m interested in hearing how others think about this - not necessarily what to do, but how to think about it, although I am open to some suggestions.",

I am relatively new to actively managing my own investments even though I was able to build a solid base through my 401k and through a ROTH conversion from a prior plan this was mostly managed for me through my old advisor andor the 2060 retirement date that i just had all of my money in . I enjoy bouncing ideas around and understanding how different people think about portfolio construction so I am hoping that I can do that here . I ’ ll also say upfront Bogleheads I respect the philosophy and the reminders that beating the market consistently is difficult but I am hoping to avoid that debate here . Thank you in advance . All of my money is now with Fidelity . I recently switched from American Funds and have been happy so far especially with the broader fund selection and the elimination of load fees . Current balances Roth IRA $ 90k 401k $ 95k Taxable TOD $ 18k Current allocations Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 25 % FDCPX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 65 % FSELX 25 % FXAIX 10 % AGTHX legacy holding from American Funds I ’ m 32 and intentionally running a very aggressive strategy but I ’ m starting to think more about diversification . I ’ m especially curious whether there are any nontech or nonsemiconductor funds that people feel have historically outperformed or provided strong longterm returns . I know I want to replace FDCPX since it ’ s also techheavy and overlaps with FSELX I am just not_sure with what yet . I ’ ve also considered switching FCNTX to either FXAIX or FBGRX but my hesitation is that FCNTX seems to have stronger lifetime performance than FXAIX and feels more complementary to FSELX than FBGRX which appears more growth and techconcentrated . Restructure plan as of now Roth IRA 50 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 15 % FSENX 10 % FFFCX 401k 100 % FDKLX Target Date 2060 Taxable TOD 40 % FSELX 25 % FCNTX 20 % FSENX 10 % AGTHX 5 % FFFCX I ’ m interested in hearing how others think about this not_necessarily what to do but how to think about it although I am open to some suggestions ."

Something like the top 10 positive contributors and the top 10 negative contributors by weight to that ETF. If, for instance, stock A is 5% of the ETF and it went up 8%, it would have contributed +0.4% to the fund’s performance. If stock B is 1% of the fund, and went down by 20%, it would have contributed -0.2%. So, if VOO is down, why? Did Nvidia drop a fair amount and everything else was stable, or did all the banks drop due to a regulation change, etc? I can find S&P 500 movers but, since they are not weighted, it doesn’t tell the story. Not to mention I am looking for this for any given ETF. Does this exist and my searches suck? Does this not exist because it’s solved another way?",

      "selftext": "I’ve been building my portfolio for a few years now, but with the current sentiment around an AI bubble, I’m starting to feel over-leveraged in tech. Currently sitting on about $70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy. Portfolio Breakdown: • VOO: $30k (Taxable) • Tencent (TCEHY): $10k • Roth IRA: $20k (Broad market ETFs) • Misc: $10k in individual stocks The Concern: Between VOO’s heavy weighting in mag-seven/AI and my Tencent position, my exposure to a tech correction is significant. I’m trying to decide the best way to \"crash-proof\" without being an emotional seller. Specifically: 1. Stop-Losses vs. Hedging: Does anyone actually use limit sells/stop-losses for long-term holds like VOO, or is the risk of being \"stopped out\" during a flash dip too high? 2. The Tencent Position: It’s a large chunk of my individual holdings. Given the current macro environment, would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector? 3. Strategy: For those who think we are in a bubble, are you staying the course with the S&P 500, or are you moving toward a higher bond/cash position to buy a potential dip? Not looking to \"time the market\" perfectly, just want to ensure I'm not being reckless by holding through a potential 2000-style tech pop.",

Currently sitting on about $ 70k total and looking for a sanity check on my risk management strategy . Portfolio Breakdown • VOO $ 30k Taxable • Tencent TCEHY $ 10k • Roth IRA $ 20k Broad market ETFs • Misc $ 10k in individual stocks The Concern Between VOO ’ s heavy weighting in magsevenAI and my Tencent position my exposure to a tech correction is significant . I ’ m trying to decide the best way to crashproof without being an emotional seller . Specifically 1 . StopLosses vs . Hedging Does anyone actually use limit sellsstoplosses for longterm holds like VOO or is the risk of being stopped out during a flash dip too high 2 . The Tencent Position It ’ s a large chunk of my individual holdings . Given the current macro environment would you trim this to rotate into a more defensive sector 3 . Strategy For those who think we are in a bubble are you staying the course with the SP 500 or are you moving toward a higher bondcash position to buy a potential dip Not_looking to time the market perfectly just want to ensure Im not_being reckless by holding through a potential 2000style tech pop ."

To train and run large-scale AI, you also need: \\- Infrastructure (data centers, networking, cooling) \\- Energy (significant power to run the systems) This means that the economic upside isn’t limited to the big tech names. Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues. AI is more then digital, it’s physical, capital-intensive, and energy-dependant. Do you think the real AI winners are the mega-caps everyone knows, or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies?",

To train and run largescale AI you also need Infrastructure data centers networking cooling Energy significant power to run the systems This means that the economic upside isn ’ t limited to the big tech names . Mid and smaller cap companies in infrastructure and energy could see significant growth if AI adoption continues . AI is more then digital it ’ s physical capitalintensive and energydependant . Do you think the real AI winners are the megacaps everyone knows or the broader stack of infrastructure and energy companies"

      "selftext": "Selling VUG in taxable account to rebalance I’m 27 and have about $27,000 in a taxable brokerage account with Robinhood. I was investing 50/30/20 in VOO/VUG/VXUS, and that is the current breakdown of my portfolio balance. I would like to now aim for a 70/30 split in VOO/VXUS as I am worried I am too leveraged into US large cap growth, especially with a looming tech bubble. My question is, should I: 1) sell off my VUG position and rebalance into VOO/VXUS since I have held the assets for more than a year and should be in the 15% capital gains bracket based on my standard income? 2) sell off VUG and put it into VTI instead of VOO to better hedge against the tech bubble pop, and keep investing in VTI going forward? 3) not touch VUG at all and just continue to invest in VOO/VXUS or VTI/VXUS moving forward? Best I can figure is about $150 in taxes from capital gains, which I think I can offset by tax loss harvesting a solo stock I bought years ago as a crap shoot that’s down $144. Is that all not worth it and should I just sit on it and let my future allocations act to rebalance and dilute the impact it will have on me? Edit: I got my tax loss harvesting wrong, my gains from VUG are about $1000 so the -$144 from the stock does very little.",

      "title": "Are we Close to Another Top?",
      "selftext": "Back in early October, I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $637, most people said I was crazy, then ironically, that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later. Here we are three months later, and we are just about at that level again. So now what? With the recent batch of earnings, it does appear the market is building strength, but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build. Maybe we top out here, or maybe resistance breaks, only to produce a throw over, which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure. Other issues I’m seeing… # Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle. Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets. A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally. On the other hand, when the liquidity dries up, markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong. Many traders don’t look at liquidity at all, others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening, but that’s only part of the story. Another important tool is the Federal Reserve’s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility, commonly referred to as RRP. This program allows large financial institutions, especially money market funds, to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities. Last year, markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system. Essentially, RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process. Take a look at RRP now… [ That cushion is now essentially gone. Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today. That is essentially nothing. When the tank is empty, it becomes concerning. The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone, and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward; this is generally negative for stocks. # Put/Call Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the put/call ratio. This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option. When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection. Being that this is a contrary an indicator, this often marks market bottoms. Low readings, generally below 0.55, signal complacency and excessive optimism, which tend to show up near market tops. Right now, the equity put call ratio is at .54, so yeah, it’s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon. # XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) vs. Consumer Staples (XLP). XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food, beverages, and household products. Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment. XLY represents more discretionary spending, including companies like Amazon, Tesla, and Home Depot. These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances. When XLY outperforms XLP, it signals a risk on environment. Consumers are spending freely, and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market. When XLP starts to outperform XLY, it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities. That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign, even if the broader market is still climbing. See Chart... [ We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary. That shift does not mean a selloff is about to happen. Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build. However, it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface. As of late January 2026, XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY. When you combine that with a put/call ratio hovering near complacent levels, it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising. Most people probably don’t even know what I’m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 9-11 is quickly approaching, but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around. You should digest this information however you wish. There’s no reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other, but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February, which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years, is simply good financial positioning.",

      "selftext_processed": "Back in early October I made a post claiming that QQQ with top out at about $ 637 most people said I was crazy then ironically that was the exact spot it corrected weeks later . Here we are three months later and we are just about at that level again . So now what With the recent batch of earnings it does appear the market is building strength but there are a few signs that underlying market weakness is continuing to build . Maybe we top out here or maybe resistance breaks only to produce a throw over which is common on the fifth wave of an Elliott structure . Other issues I ’ m seeing… Liquidity Liquidity is the first and most important piece of the puzzle . Liquidity is essentially the fuel that drives financial markets . A perfect example of this was during Covid when the government stimulus helped power a major rally . On the other hand when the liquidity dries up markets often struggle even if fundamentals are strong . Many traders don ’ t look at liquidity at all others only focus on if the Fed is engaging in quantitative easing or quantitative tightening but that ’ s only part of the story . Another important tool is the Federal Reserve ’ s Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement facility commonly referred to as RRP . This program allows large financial institutions especially money market funds to park cash at the Fed overnight in exchange for Treasury securities . Last year markets held up better than expected during the quantitative tightening phase because money was flowing out of the RRP and back into the financial system . Essentially RRP acted as a cushion against the quantitative tightening process . Take a look at RRP now… That cushion is now essentially gone . Balances in the RRP facility have fallen from roughly $ 2.5 trillion in 2023 to only about a billion today . That is essentially nothing_When the tank is empty it becomes concerning . The large pool of idle cash that could flow back into the system is now gone and so is the excess fuel that can power the market forward this is generally negative for stocks . PutCall Ratio One of my favorite sentiment indicators and one of the indicators that is often overlooked is the putcall ratio . This indicator compares the volume of put options traded to that of a call option . When the ratio hits .75 the suggests that fear is dominating as traders seek increased protection . Being that this is a contrary an indicator this often marks market bottoms . Low readings generally below 0.55 signal complacency and excessive optimism which tend to show up near market tops . Right now the equity put call ratio is at .54 so yeah it ’ s at a level where we need to be concerned that a market top could be forming and a pullback is on the horizon . XLY vs. XLP Something else I am monitoring is the relationship between the Consumer Discretionary XLY vs. Consumer Staples XLP . XLP represents companies that sell essential goods such as food beverages and household products . Things everybody needs and will continue to buy in any market environment . XLY represents more discretionary spending including companies like Amazon Tesla and Home Depot . These are purchases people make when they feel confident in their finances . When XLY outperforms XLP it signals a risk on environment . Consumers are spending freely and that is typically bullish for the economy and the market . When XLP starts to outperform XLY it suggests consumers are becoming more cautious and shifting spending toward necessities . That defensive rotation can be an early warning sign even if the broader market is still climbing . See Chart ... We are now seeing signs that Staples are beginning to outperform Discretionary . That shift does not_mean a selloff is about to happen . Markets can continue rising for weeks even as these internal warning signals build . However it does tell us that defensive positioning may be quietly increasing under the surface . As of late January 2026 XLP has shown noticeably stronger performance year to date compared with XLY . When you combine that with a putcall ratio hovering near complacent levels it suggests the market may be on a short leash where the risks are rising . Most people probably don ’ t even know what I ’ m talking about when I say the Gann window from February 911 is quickly approaching but this is generally an inflection point where markets turn around . You should digest this information however you wish . There ’ s no_reason to jump to conclusions one way or the other but as traders we should consider that conditions are shifting and that being a little more defensive heading into February which is generally the second worst trading month of the year and one of only two months that has negative returns over the last 80 years is simply good financial positioning ."

This initiative marks a notable advancement in the adoption of digital currencies, as Fidelity seeks to expand its presence in the cryptocurrency market. The launch is seen as a significant step towards mainstream acceptance of crypto assets, reflecting the growing interest from institutional investors in digital currency.

Many investors start the year with clear intentions, but after a few weeks in, market noise and real-life constraints tend to test those plans. Curious how this is playing out for others: * Are you still aligned with the goals you set at the start of the year? * Have you already adjusted your strategy based on new information or constraints? * Or did you realize some goals weren’t realistic and reset entirely? From an investing perspective, where is your current focus leaning? * increasing consistency / discipline * reducing risk or exposure * building cash or dry powder * simplifying portfolio structure * reassessing overall strategy There’s no single “correct” path, but early reflection often prevents bigger mistakes later in the year.

      "title": "The Block (SQ) stock risk assessment :",
      "selftext": "I’ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10-Ks and other news. I usually run it on companies I’m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks. I recently ran it on Block (SQ) given the recent volatility and the \"AI pivot and Crypto\" narrative. While the stock has momentum, the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines. I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them. 1. The \"Value Destruction\" Gap (ROIC vs. WACC) This was the loudest signal. This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost: ROIC (Return on Invested Capital): \\\\\\~0.76% WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital): \\\\\\~8.21% Despite reporting accounting profits, the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now. Operational returns aren't covering the cost of capital. Usually, you see this in dying industries, not \"growth\" fintechs. Is this just temporary due to the restructuring, or is the core payments business losing efficiency? 2. Cash Flow Quality: Organic or Accounting Magic? Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible: jumping from 101M to 1.7B (2024). The Red Flag: The tool flagged that this wasn't driven purely by higher sales. It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital. Receivables dropped from $7.19B → $5.67B. Payables fell from $141M → $118M. Retained Earnings swung wildly from -528M to +2.3B. This suggests the cash flow boom is largely \"one-off\" balance sheet timing (squeezing customers/suppliers) rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power. 3. The $11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill: $11.4B Intangibles: $1.4B Total: \\\\\\~35% of Total Assets. With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI, and away from legacy integrations, the tool flagged a high risk of impairment. If the acquisitions that make up that $11B (like Afterpay) underperform, we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity. 4. Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction. Long-term debt jumped from $4.97B to $6.4B. Simultaneously, they spent \\\\\\~$1.17B on equity repayments/buybacks. Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76% seems like questionable capital allocation. Conclusion: The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency (ROIC) is surprisingly weak. For those tracking SQ: Do you view the ROIC/WACC spread as a dealbreaker, or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffs/restructuring fully take effect?",

      "selftext_processed": "I ’ ve been working on a tool to automate risk analysis specifically to catch red flags that often get buried in 10Ks and other news . I usually run it on companies I ’ m eyeing to see if I missed any structural risks . I recently ran it on Block SQ given the recent volatility and the AI pivot and Crypto narrative . While the stock has momentum the tool surfaced some deep fundamental disconnects that go beyond the usual headlines . I wanted to share the 4 biggest risks it flagged to see if you guys think these are valid concerns or if the market is rightfully ignoring them . 1 . The Value Destruction Gap ROIC vs. WACC This was the loudest signal . This was flagged a massive spread between return and cost ROIC Return on Invested Capital 0.76 % WACC Weighted Average Cost of Capital 8.21 % Despite reporting accounting profits the business is technically destroying shareholder value on every dollar invested right now . Operational returns arent covering the cost of capital . Usually you see this in dying industries not_growth fintechs . Is this just temporary due to the restructuring or is the core payments business losing efficiency 2 . Cash Flow Quality Organic or Accounting Magic Headline Operating Cash Flow looks incredible jumping from 101M to 1.7B 2024 . The Red Flag The tool flagged that this wasnt driven purely by higher sales . It was driven by a sharp contraction in working capital . Receivables dropped from $ 7.19B → $ 5.67B . Payables fell from $ 141M → $ 118M . Retained Earnings swung wildly from 528M to 2.3B . This suggests the cash flow boom is largely oneoff balance sheet timing squeezing customerssuppliers rather than a permanent improvement in earnings power . 3 . The $ 11.4 Billion Goodwill Overhang Goodwill $ 11.4B Intangibles $ 1.4B Total 35 % of Total Assets . With the company pivoting focus toward Bitcoin and AI and away from legacy integrations the tool flagged a high risk of impairment . If the acquisitions that make up that $ 11B like Afterpay underperform we could see a massive writedown that wipes out reported equity . 4 . Borrowing to Buy Back Stock The financing activities section shows a contradiction . Longterm debt jumped from $ 4.97B to $ 6.4B . Simultaneously they spent $ 1.17B on equity repaymentsbuybacks . Leveraging up the balance sheet to buy back stock while ROIC is 0.76 % seems like questionable capital allocation . Conclusion The tool paints a picture of a company that is optically improving cash flow through working capital adjustments while the underlying capital efficiency ROIC is surprisingly weak . For those tracking SQ Do you view the ROICWACC spread as a dealbreaker or is it a lagging indicator that will catch up as the layoffsrestructuring fully take effect"
